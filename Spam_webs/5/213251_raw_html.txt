  <p>
   The Dvorak keyboard, named for its inventor, Dr. August Dvorak, was
designed with the goal of maximizing typing efficiency.  For over a century,
typists have been using the qwerty keyboard arrangement, a hack that was
implemented to work around the mechanical limitations of early typewriters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contrary to popular opinion, the qwerty design was not actually invented to
slow typists down.  Rather, the layout was intended to place common two-letter
combinations on opposite sides of the keyboard.  On manual typewriters, each
key is mechanically connected to a lever that has the reversed image of a
letter on it.  If a typist were to hit two keys on the same side of the
keyboard in rapid succession, the second lever on its way up would hit the
first on its way down, the keys would become stuck together, and the typist
would have to stop typing and unstick the keys.  The qwerty layout was a clever
design that minimized this problem.  However, now that most of us use computers
(or electric typewriters that don't use levers), the problem of keys jamming is
no longer a consideration.  Also, computers now enable us to switch layouts
while continuing to use the same equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most people learn to type on a qwerty keyboard.  New typists learn the
qwerty arrangement because that's most likely what they'll encounter on the
existing equipment they'll be using; new equipment is standardized to the
qwerty arrangement because that's what the vast majority of us know.  Most
people are reluctant to switch because they're afraid of how long it will take
them to learn the new arrangement, and of the additional effort of having to
switch layouts on all of the equipment they might encounter.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Dvorak's Claims
  </h3>
  <p>
   According to Dvorak, prior to World War II, researchers had found that
after three
   <em>
    years
   </em>
   of typing instruction, the average typing student's
speed was 47
   <a href="nwpm.html">
    net words per minute
   </a>
   (NWPM).  Since
typists were scarce during the war, the U.S. Navy selected fourteen typists for
a 1944 study to assess whether Dvorak retraining would be feasible.  Dvorak
found that it took an average of only 52
   <em>
    hours
   </em>
   of training for those
typists' speeds on the Dvorak keyboard to reach their average speeds on the
qwerty keyboard.  By the end of the study their Dvorak speeds were 74 percent
faster than their qwerty speeds, and their accuracies had increased by 68
percent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dvorak attributed the increase in accuracy to the fact that on keyboard,
that the most common digraphs (two-letter combinations, such as "ed")
in English would occur with a minimum of "hurdling" (having to jump
over a key as if it were a hurdle), and would use stronger fingers rather than
weaker ones.  Dvorak estimated that the fingers of an average typist in his day
travelled between 12 and 20 miles on a qwerty keyboard; the same text on a
Dvorak keyboard would require only about one mile of travel.  Dvorak believed
that hurdling and awkward keystroke combinations were responsible for most of
the common errors typists make.  His list of the
   <a href="demons.html">
    most
common typing errors
   </a>
   on the Dvorak and qwerty keyboards is interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately, subsequent investigation has shown that at best, the
experiments in the Navy study were biased, and at worst, fabricated.  See
   <a href="http://www.reason.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html">
    Typing Errors
   </a>
   , from the
June 1996 issue of
   <a href="http://www.reason.com/">
    Reason Magazine
   </a>
   for a
thorough discussion of this topic, as well as more information about the
   <a href="history.html">
    early history of the typewriter and the qwerty
keyboard
   </a>
   .  In the mid 1950s, U.S. Government's General Services
Administration commissioned a study by Earle Strong to confirm Dvorak's
results.  Strong's study, which included proper controls and which was set up
to allow direct comparison of qwerty and Dvorak data, found that after
sufficient training, Dvorak typists were able to match their previous qwerty
speeds, but not surpass them.  Furthermore, additional qwerty training for
qwerty typists resulted in a greater increase in speed than additional Dvorak
training for Dvorak typists who typed at a similar rate.  These results would
suggest that Dvorak's claims of faster and more efficient typing are bogus, and
switching layouts on the basis of speed and efficiency would not make sense.
  </p>
  <h3>
   My Own Experience
  </h3>
  <p>
   Having heard Dvorak's claims, but not the modern-day scientific analysis of
his experiments, I decided to switch to the Dvorak layout in the late 1980s,
when computer software (specifically version 10 of the X Window System) made it
fairly simple to remap the keyboard layout without making any hardware changes.
It took a few months for my Dvorak speed to catch up to my qwerty speed.  I
found the Dvorak layout to be more comfortable and less effort.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a period of four or five years, I used the qwerty layout at work (on a
shared DOS computer), and the Dvorak layout at home, spending about half of my
typing time on each.  During that time, my Dvorak speed increased to 90 wpm,
and my qwerty speed reached 80 wpm.  My accuracy improved slightly on both
layouts.  On the Dvorak layout, my most common typos are reversing two letters,
whereas on the qwerty layout, it's more common for me to hit the wrong key
altogether.  (Note also that several people have made the claim that it's
impossible to be able to switch back and forth between different keyboard
layouts.  That certainly hasn't been my experience, and I'm always happy to
demonstrate for non-believers.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The greatest benefit I've found from the Dvorak layout is that, in addition
to feeling more comfortable, the typing-related discomfort I was beginning to
experience in my wrists and forearms diminished, even though the amount of
typing I was doing remained constant.  Once my workplace switched from DOS to
Windows and I was able to use the Dvorak layout everwhere, those problems
vanished and have not returned.  I believe that Dvorak's claims that his layout
requires less "hurdling" over keys and less total finger travel are
true, and that this is more or less directly responsible for the reduction in
RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) symptoms that I have experienced.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Recommendations
  </h3>
  <p>
   Was making the switch worth it?  Yes, because of the ergonomic benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Would I recommend it to other people?  Yes, particularly if you have RSI
problems from typing.  When you first make the switch, the unfamiliar layout
will slow you down, helping your injured arms and wrists heal.  Once your
Dvorak speed catches up with your qwerty speed (which it eventually will), you
will likely find typing more comfortable (or at least less uncomfortable), and
it may be less likely that your RSI will recur.

   How to Remap Your Keyboard
  </h2>
  <h3>
   Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000, and ME
  </h3>
  <p>
   From the "Start" menu, select "Settings" and then
"Control Panel".  From the Control Panel, double-click on
"Keyboard".  From the Keyboard folder, select the
"Language" tab and click on the "Properties" button.
Select "United States-Dvorak" and then click on the "OK"
button.  Windows may ask you for the installation CD to copy the dvorak driver.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Windows 3.1 and Windows NT 3.51
  </h3>
  <p>
   Select the "International" icon from your control panel.  Then
select "keyboard", and "US-Dvorak".  This may require you
to install the Dvorak keyboard DLL from your Windows install disks.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Macintosh
  </h3>
  <p>
   On computers running Mac OS 9.x and later, select the "Apple
Menu", then "Control Panels", then "Keyboard", and
then select "Dvorak".  There is a second "Dvorak" layout
which reverts to qwerty when the command key is held down.

       the period and comma keys should be reversed, and that Microsoft is
       responsible for the change.  I do not know whether or when these keys
       may have been switched, but if the change did occur, it certainly
