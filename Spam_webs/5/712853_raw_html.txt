  A single skeletal muscle, such as the
  <b>
   triceps
  </b>
  muscle, is attached at its
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     origin
    </b>
    to a large area of bone; in this case, the
    <b>
     humerus
    </b>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    At its other end, the
    <b>
     insertion
    </b>
    , it tapers into a glistening white
    <b>
     tendon
    </b>
    which, in this case, is attached to the
    <b>
     ulna
    </b>
    , one of the bones of the lower arm.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">
   As the triceps contracts, the insertion is pulled toward the origin and the arm is straightened or extended at the elbow. Thus the triceps is an
   <b>
    extensor
   </b>
   . Because skeletal muscle exerts force only when it contracts, a second muscle 
 a
   <b>
    flexor
   </b>
   
 is needed to flex or bend the joint. The
   <b>
    biceps
   </b>
   muscle is the flexor of the lower arm. Together, the biceps and triceps make up an
   <b>
    antagonistic pair
   </b>
   of muscles. Similar pairs, working antagonistically across other joints, provide for almost all the movement of the

   .
  </p>
  <h2>
   The
   <a name="MuscleFiber">
    Muscle Fiber
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Skeletal muscle is made up of thousands of cylindrical muscle
   <b>
    fibers
   </b>
   often running all the way from origin to insertion. The fibers are bound together by
   <a href="../A/AnimalTissues.html#Supporting_connective_tissue">
    connective tissue
   </a>
   through which run blood vessels and nerves.
  </p>
  Each muscle fibers contains:
  <ul>
   <li>
    an array of
    <b>
     myofibrils
    </b>
    that are stacked lengthwise and run the entire length of the fiber;
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     mitochondria
    </b>
    ;
   </li>
   <li>
    an extensive
    <b>
     <a href="../E/ER.html#SER">
      smooth endoplasmic reticulum
     </a>
     (SER)
    </b>
    ;
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     many nuclei
    </b>
    (thus each skeletal muscle fiber is a
    <a href="../S/S.html#syncytium">
     syncytium
    </a>
    ).
   </li>
  </ul>
  The multiple nuclei arise from the fact that each muscle fiber develops from the fusion of many cells (called
  <b>
   myoblasts
  </b>
  ).
  <p>
   The number of fibers is probably fixed early in life. This is regulated by
   <b>
    <a href="../C/CellSignaling.html#TGF-b">
     myostatin
    </a>
   </b>
   , a
   <a href="../C/C.html#cytokine">
    cytokine
   </a>
   that is synthesized in muscle cells (and circulates as a hormone later in life). Myostatin
   <b>
    suppresses
   </b>
   skeletal muscle development. (Cytokines secreted by a cell type that inhibit proliferation of that same type of cell are called
   <b>
    chalones
   </b>
   .) Cattle and mice with inactivating mutations in their myostatin genes develop much larger muscles. Some athletes and other remarkably strong people have been found to carry one mutant myostatin gene. These discoveries have already led to the growth of an illicit market in drugs supposedly able to suppress myostatin.
  </p>
  <p>
   In adults, increased muscle mass comes about through an increase in the thickness of the individual fibers and increase in the amount of connective tissue. In the mouse, at least, fibers increase in size by attracting more myoblasts to fuse with them. The fibers attract more myoblasts by releasing the cytokine interleukin 4 (
   <a href="../I/I.html#interleukins">
    IL-4
   </a>
   ). Anything that lowers the level of myostatin also leads to an increase in fiber size.
  </p>
  Because a muscle fiber is not a single cell, its parts are often given special names such as
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>
     sarcolemma
    </b>
    for
    <a href="../C/CellMembranes.html">

  although this tends to obscure the essential similarity in structure and function of these structures and those found in other cells.
  <img align="right" alt="" height="299" src="../S/striated0.5.jpg" width="200"/>

   The nuclei and mitochondria are located just beneath the plasma membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum extends between the myofibrils.

   Seen from the side under the microscope, skeletal muscle fibers show a pattern of cross banding, which gives rise to the other name:

  The entire array of thick and thin filaments between the Z disks is called a

  <ul>

    The

    The

   <li>
    The

      titin
     </a>
    </b>
    , extend from the M line to the Z disk. One of its functions is to provide elasticity to the muscle. It also provides a scaffold for the assembly of a precise number of myosin molecules in the thick filament (294 in one case). It may also dictate the number of actin molecules in the thin filaments.

  Shortening of the sarcomeres in a myofibril produces the shortening of the myofibril and, in turn, of the muscle fiber of which it is a part. [This electron micrograph of a single sarcomere was kindly provided by Dr. H. E. Huxley.]

  <img align="right" alt="" height="272" src="../L/lioness.gif" width="428"/>
  <p>
   The contraction of skeletal muscle is controlled by the nervous system. The Dying Lioness (an Assyrian relief dating from about 650 B.C. and supplied through the courtesy of The Trustees of the British Museum) shows this vividly. Injury to the spinal cord has paralyzed the otherwise undamaged hind legs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this respect, skeletal muscle differs from smooth and cardiac muscle. Both cardiac and smooth muscle can contract without being stimulated by the nervous system. Nerves of the
   <a href="../P/PNS.html#autonomic">
    autonomic branch of the nervous system
   </a>
   lead to both smooth and cardiac muscle, but their effect is one of moderating the rate and/or strength of contraction.

    sensory-somatic branch

   of the nervous system cause the skeletal muscle fibers at which they terminate to contract. The junction between the terminal of a motor neuron and a muscle fiber is called the neuromuscular junction. It is simply one kind of
   <a href="../S/Synapses.html">
    synapse
   </a>
   . (The neuromuscular junction is also called the myoneural junction.)
  </p>
  <img align="left" alt="" height="333" src="../N/NM_Junction.jpg" width="295"/>
  <p>
   The terminals of motor axons contain thousands of vesicles filled with
   <b>
    <a href="../S/Synapses.html#acetylcholine">
     acetylcholine
    </a>
   </b>
   (
   <b>
    ACh
   </b>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Many of these can be seen in the electron micrograph on the left (courtesy of Prof. B. Katz).
  </p>
  <p>
   When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, hundreds of these vesicles discharge their ACh onto a specialized area of postsynaptic membrane on the muscle fiber (the folded membrane running diagonally upward from the lower left). This area contains a cluster of transmembrane channels that are opened by ACh and let sodium ions (Na
   <sup>
    +
   </sup>
   ) diffuse in.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interior of a resting muscle fiber has a
   <b>
    <a href="../E/ExcitableCells.html">
     resting potential
    </a>
   </b>
   of about 95 mV. The influx of sodium ions reduces the charge, creating an
   <b>
    end plate potential
   </b>
   . If the end plate potential reaches the
   <b>
    threshold
   </b>
   voltage (approximately 50 mV), sodium ions flow in with a rush and an
   <b>
    <a href="../E/ExcitableCells.html#action">
     action potential
    </a>
   </b>
   is created in the fiber. The action potential sweeps down the length of the fiber just as it does in an axon.

   No visible change occurs in the muscle fiber during (and immediately following) the action potential. This period, called the

  <a name="refractory_period">

  <h2>

  </h2>
  <p>
   The process of contracting takes some 50 msec; relaxation of the fiber takes another 50100 msec. Because the refractory period is so much shorter than the time needed for contraction and relaxation, the fiber can be maintained in the contracted state so long as it is stimulated frequently enough (e.g., 50 stimuli per second). Such sustained contraction is called
   <b>
    tetanus
   </b>
   .

  In the figure,
  <ul>
   <li>
    When shocks are given at 1/sec, the muscle responds with a single twitch.
   </li>
   <li>
    At 5/sec and 10/sec, the individual twitches begin to fuse together, a phenomenon called
    <b>
     clonus
    </b>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    At 50 shocks per second, the muscle goes into the smooth, sustained contraction of tetanus.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Clonus and tetanus are possible because the refractory period is much briefer than the time needed to complete a cycle of contraction and relaxation. Note that the amount of contraction is greater in clonus and tetanus than in a single twitch.
  </p>
  <p>
   As we normally use our muscles, the individual fibers go into tetanus for brief periods rather than simply undergoing single twitches.

Then the linkages break (for which ATP is needed) and reform farther along the thin filament to repeat the process. As a result, the filaments are pulled past each other in a ratchetlike action. There is no shortening, thickening, or folding of the individual filaments.

   <li>
    Spaced along the plasma membrane (

    . These tubules plunge repeatedly into the interior of the fiber.

   <li>
    The T-tubules terminate near the calcium-filled sacs of the
    <b>
     sarcoplasmic reticulum
    </b>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Each action potential created at the neuromuscular junction sweeps quickly along the sarcolemma and is carried into the T-tubules.
    <img alt="" height="332" src="../S/sarco_ret.gif" width="536"/>
    <br clear="right"/>
   </li>
   <li>
    The arrival of the action potential at the ends of the T-tubules triggers the release of Ca
    <sup>

    </sup>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    The Ca

   </li>
   <li>
    This turns on the interaction between actin and myosin and the sarcomere contracts.
   </li>
   <li>
    Because of the speed of the action potential (milliseconds), the action potential arrives virtually simultaneously at the ends of all the T-tubules, ensuring that all sarcomeres contract in unison.
   </li>

    When the process is over, the calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum using a

  If a stimulated muscle is held so that it cannot shorten, it simply exerts tension. This is called an

  ("same length") contraction. If the muscle is allowed to shorten, the contraction is called
  <b>

  </b>
  ("same tension").
  <h2>
   <a name="MotorUnit">
    Motor
   </a>
   Units
  </h2>
  <p>
   All motor neurons leading to skeletal muscles have branching axons, each of which terminates in a neuromuscular junction with a single muscle fiber. Nerve impulses passing down a single motor neuron will thus trigger contraction in all the muscle fibers at which the branches of that neuron terminate. This minimum unit of contraction is called the
   <b>
    motor unit
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The size of the motor unit is small in muscles over which we have precise control. Examples:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    a single motor neuron triggers fewer than 10 fibers in the muscles controlling eye movements;
   </li>
   <li>
    the motor units of the muscles controlling the larynx are as small as 23 fibers per motor neuron;
   </li>
   <li>
    In contrast, a single motor unit for a muscle like the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle may include 10002000 fibers (scattered uniformly through the muscle).
   </li>
  </ul>
  Although the response of a motor unit is all-or-none, the strength of the response of the entire muscle is determined by the
  <b>
   number of motor units
  </b>
  activated.
  <p>
   Even at rest, most of our skeletal muscles are in a state of partial contraction called
   <b>
    tonus
   </b>
   . Tonus is maintained by the activation of a few motor units at all times even in resting muscle. As one set of motor units relaxes, another set takes over.

Although a muscle fiber contains only enough ATP to power a few twitches, its ATP "pool" is replenished as needed. 
There are three sources of high-energy phosphate to keep the ATP pool filled.

  <p>
   In mice, the number of Type I vs Type II fibers can be changed with exercise and drug treatment. Whether the same holds true for humans remains to be seen. Perhaps training in humans does not alter the
   <b>

  </p>
  <img align="right" alt="" height="291" src="../C/cardiac.gif" width="543"/>
  However, cardiac muscle has a number of unique features that reflect its function of pumping blood.

   <li>
    The myofibrils of each cell (and cardiac muscle is made of single cells 
 each with a single nucleus) are branched.

    The branches interlock with those of adjacent fibers by

    ) do run to the heart, but their effect is simply to modulate  
 increase or decrease 
 the intrinsic rate and the strength of the heartbeat. Even if the nerves are  destroyed (as they are in a transplanted heart), the heart continues to beat.
   </li>

    The action potential that drives contraction of the heart passes from fiber to fiber through

      Significance: all the fibers contract in a synchronous wave that sweeps from the atria down through the ventricles and pumps blood out of the heart. Anything that interferes with this synchronous wave (such as damage to part of the heart muscle from a heart attack) may cause the fibers of the heart to beat at random 
 called
      <b>
       fibrillation
      </b>
      . Fibrillation is the ultimate cause of most deaths, and its reversal is the function of defibrillators that are part of the equipment in ambulances, hospital emergency rooms, and even on U.S. air lines.

    The

    <b>

    <b>
     tetanus

    is not possible (a good thing, too!).
   </li>
   <li>
    Cardiac muscle has a much richer supply of mitochondria than skeletal muscle. This reflects its greater dependence on cellular respiration for ATP.
   </li>
   <li>
    Cardiac muscle has little glycogen and gets little benefit from glycolysis when the supply of oxygen is limited.
    <ul>

Some evidence:
  <ul>
   <li>
    A disease resembling myasthenia gravis can be induced in experimental animals by immunizing them with purified ACh receptors.
   </li>
   <li>
    Anti-ACh receptor antibodies are found in the
    <a href="../S/S.html#serum">
     serum
    </a>
    of human patients.
   </li>
   <li>
    Experimental animals injected with serum from human patients develop the signs of myasthenia gravis.
   </li>
   <li>
    Newborns of mothers with myasthenia gravis often show mild signs of the disease for a short time after their birth. This is the result of the transfer of the mother's antibodies across the placenta during gestation.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The reason some people develop autoimmune antibodies against the ACh receptor is unknown.

    The Cardiac Myopathies
   </a>
  </h2>
  Cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, contains many proteins in addition to actin and myosin. Mutations in the genes for these may cause the wall of the heart to become weakened and, in due course, enlarged. Among the genes that have been implicated in these diseases are those encoding:
  <ul>
   <li>
    actin
   </li>
   <li>
    two types of myosin
   </li>
   <li>
    troponin
   </li>
   <li>
    tropomyosin
   </li>
   <li>
    myosin-binding protein C (which links myosin to
    <a href="../P/Proteins.html">
     titin
    </a>
    )
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The severity of the disease varies with the particular mutation causing it (over 100 have been identified so far) . Some mutations are sufficiently dangerous that they can lead to sudden catastrophic heart failure in seemingly healthy and active young adults.
