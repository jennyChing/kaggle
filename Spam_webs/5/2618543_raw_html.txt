         This sketch is intended as anintroduction to the new therapy my wife Millis and I developedto treat her gene-driven Huntingtons Disease (HD). It is based mainly on BruceLiptons pioneering epigenetic research; we call it Integral Epigenetic Love Therapy 24/7. After two and a half years of intensive application24/7 we report that our therapy has reduced her heretofore thought incurable HD, inherited from her father, by an estimated 85-90%. Please note that while one case does not make a scientific study, Millis has adramatically new, almost symptom-free, happy outlook on life.

         <strong>
          Huntingtons Disease (HD)
         </strong>
         is a devastating genetically inherited progressive neurodegenera- tive disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and psychiatric problems. Symptoms may include involuntary physical movements, irritability, apathy, anxiety, depressed mood, obsessive-compulsive behavior, changes in libido, and psychosis. There is no record of an HD patient experiencing spontaneous remission. There is no cure for HD.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Integral
         </strong>
         is defined as including everything essential to a whole functioning psyche and body, for example, anima and animus as equally important complementary opposites; self-management skills, intellectual, feeling-emotion, sensation, intuition, and feedback receptiveness and processing skills.

         <strong>
          Epigenetics
         </strong>
         is the scientific study of how changes in environment have shaped genes, hence evolution, over millions of years (Francis 2011). Contemporary epigenetics is based on recent scientific research findings, e.g. cellular biologist Bruce Lipton (2006) and others, who have found that some aspects of human genes change profoundly, for more or less health or ill, with changes in their environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Love
         </strong>
         has been shown in scientific studies (Lipton 2005) to be not just a pleasurable emotion but an equally important powerful healing agent, for example, giving and receiving expressions of love elicit healing biochemicals in ones body affecting genes, e.g. oxytocin and endorphins. In contrast negative expressions such as fear, hate, disgust, etc. if misused and/or overused, may result in emitting biochemicals, e.g. cortisol, damaging to body tissue.

          About Millis HD Experience
         </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
         I first became aware my father had an active Huntingtons Disease gene when as a teenager I observed his involuntary arm movements (chorea). I first became aware I had inherited his HD gene when at age sixty-two (0l/98) my DNA test at Bay State Hospital showed positive. But I still didnt have observable symptoms common to HD patients until later when my HD symptoms  involuntary movements, cognitive and emotional issues  became gradually more obvious to my husband Bob and others who know me well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unable to find acceptable professional help closer than Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, my caregiver-husband Bob and I went there to participate in clinical studies. Finding that clinical studies would not lead to treatment and progress review, we decided to engage HD expert Dr. Rosas, neurologist-psychiatrist at Mass General. With no known cure we felt we were in relatively uncharted waters. Reducing that uncertainty, Dr. Rosas first intervention proved beneficial. She prescribed one milligram per day of the psychoactive drug Risperidone, starting in January 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
         Collaterally, Bob shared leading-edge epigenetic studies with me as they emerged. Among those were pioneering studies by Stanford research fellow, cellular biologist Bruce Lipton (2005) who had made early discoveries about how environment  individual mind-body, sociodynamic, and ecosystem  shapes our genes (epigenetics). Bob and I discussed the possibility of altering my HD genes psycho-spiritual-physical-social environment by first returning our interpersonal mutual empathic relationship to a quality commensurate with my pre-H.D. onset level. We began our environment enrichment endeavor, gradually stepping up to a more aesthetic, harmonious physical home environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surprising us, during the following six months my involuntary movements (chorea) began to gradually disappear along with some of my cognitive and emotional symptoms. My HD symptoms stabilized enough so that we were able to gradually introduce enhancements to the already existing loving environment we had going in our marriage prior to the increasing activity of my HD gene. Our relationship deteriorated badly. Not realizing it was my HD gene that was causing my growing irritation with Bob I erroneously thought we needed marriage counseling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, Bob and I continued to raise the quality and intensity of our interpersonal love environment, e.g. empathy, active listening to each other, informally, day by day, as we went along. By January 2013, people who knew me when my HD symptoms were more noticeable, like participants in our New Options Community Group, remarked how my symptoms, including involuntary movements, diminished, then disappeared. Wow, you look good, Millis! or something like that, has become common.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a result we had success in reducing my HD symptoms  physical, cognitive, and emotional  to an imperceptible level through integration of medicine and
         <em>

         </em>
         . After a progress review in June 2014 Dr. Rosas authorized reduction of Risperidone to .5 mg per day (if I so choose). With this success to date Bob and I are committed to continue our

          1.
          <strong>
           A healthful mind-body
          </strong>
          . Moderate balanced nutrition, medication, walking, Tai Chi, and mutually positive communications with husband-caregiver including plenty of respectful and empathetic touchy-feely communications, personalized to a level of quality and quantity in keeping with Mills desires. Meditation, Implicit Memory Scripting (Johnston and Higley 1994), and dream sharing have been useful tools. Also mutual empathy-based conflict management behavior options (list of 56-plus options is available, see Johnston 2010) spiced with healthful humor.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.
          <strong>
           A psycho-spiritual home climate of mutual love
          </strong>
          , extreme respect, patience, and empathy, very careful active listening, joy, harmonious relationships in general, empathic non-verbal and verbal communications. Participate as a team in making decisions about household management responsibilities, money, solving problems, etc. Keep responses positive and light-hearted no matter how frustrated and potentially angry one (the caregiver) may feel.

          That was quite interesting to read. Having been on the inside of the tunnel for about 25 years it was quite a reflective read for me. I am reinventing my role for the future. I have discussed and will continue to work with the Elders to make my contributions worthwhile. I have no desire to be in the way but to contribute in a meaningful way. I am thinking of several ways my experience can benefit the organization. I believe my background in psychology and deep transformations in life and career can benefit the organization by exit interviews. Second I believe my ability to assist Instructors with feedback on their methodology and interactions with students and other Instructors is without parallel. Due to my depth of experience as senior officer intersperced with starting over at 45 and rising to Deputy Chief a second time with the same department prepares me to be detailed to a special project assignment especially with direction from Rhodie and Hull. There is a need for a look into the future to remain relevant. To stay on the cutting edge means someone or some people are looking at what is being done with an eye on how we can ALWAYS be getting better and NOT patting ourselves on the back while we are slipping away from the mission we have carried out so well. Cortez started and so many have worked so hard to continue a path to excellence, this doesn't happen without planning and a keen eye on our progress and future needs. Thanks for stirring the mind........Remind me to talk about our dirty secret in the fire service........Mental stress from exposure to trauma........Too much to discuss on paper...........Jerry Allen, If better is possible, then good is not enough! Good is the enemy of our best..........

          This is a good summary of the origins and development of the two major streams of transdisciplinarity. I was of course disappointed that none of my thirty articles since 2005 on the logic of transdisciplinarity and most recently, its application in the field of information received mention, but so it goes. The good news is that the Nicolescu version of TD is being discussed and applied in venues dealing with information such as the 2015 Vienna Summit Conference. Nicolescu, Marcus and I participated together with leading information scientists and semioticians including Wolfgang Hofkirchner and Sren Brier and colleagues from the People's Republic of China. 
As far as CIRET is concerned, I am concerned that the French-English language barrier is a lot higher than I thought or hoped it would be and would hope that ways could be found to overcome it. Thank you.

          I am very interested in the concept of peace leadership. In Canada we are making a more concerted effort at reconicialation between Aboriginal and non Aboriginal people, in part as a result of the final report of the Truth and Reconilation Commision. In my faith community- the Unitarian Congregation of Saskatoon and in our national church- we are going through some learning and trying to develop some skills to assist with reconcilation. Your approach seems to fit really well with this. 
Do you have any training that you are offering for practioners already working in the field of non violent/compassionate communiction and reconcialtion? Any chance of coming to Canada?

          Mark Fabionar, the Director of Sonoma State University's Integral Center for Diversity, Vitality, and Creativity, responded to this inquiry at the Facebook Integral Postmetaphysical Spirituality thread on Sean's interview.*  It's good to know he and ITC are aware of the issues and have considered them deeply. And are working to address those aspects of the system not conducive to having integral impacts. That's all we can ask. Mark's response follows:

"It felt appropriate to offer my perspective in this conversation about SSU and ITC. I'm the Director of Sonoma State University's Integral Center for Diversity, Vitality, and Creativity (affectionately called "The HUB" on campus). I am the SSU employee who suggested to the MetaIntegral team that ITC be held on campus. Sean Esbjorn-Hargens and I decided to partner, and the team has been working on the conference for nearly a year.

I have similar concerns about the corporatization of public education - and SSU in particular - and appreciate the sincere inquiry into the integrity of having ITC at SSU, given Danny Weil's thought-provoking article, among others. Like many universities, SSU is largely a decentralized collective of multiple systems and cultures, and as a whole its tensions and conflicts reflect an entity that has been through many internal battles and transitions. The larger context of California's ongoing economic insecurity presents challenges for most state entities and SSU's executive team has responded to these conditions over the last several years in a manner that reflects their core value systems and worldview. That the executive team has worked to enact largely modern and market-driven responses - discursive practices championed outside of SSU as well - does not surprise me. And as Weil and others have noted, these priorities, as well as how they've been enacted and whom they've involved, have been a source of frustration and anger for a number of faculty and student affairs professionals, including me at times. (I am both management and faculty at SSU, but I am not part of the president's executive team nor am I paid what they are paid.)

Still, to the notion that having ITC at SSU primarily supports the corporate agenda of the powers-that-be, I offer (and know) that there are multiple agendas and bottom-lines being considered and played out simultaneously - albeit in contradictory ways at times - by students, faculty, staff, and members of the executive team. Many of them are good and reflect social justice research and praxis that focuses on serving the public good and the development of the whole student. There are individuals, projects, and whole programs informed by this impulse and approach to serve, to connect, and to become more accessible, relevant, and just. My sense is that there is a want within the University to better align these siloed individuals and fragmented initiatives into something more culturally and energetically robust. SSU is not a static entity - it is a dynamic, messy, living system that is going through some intense transitions, and will continue to do so over the next couple of years, as radical changes in executive leadership are anticipated. And while we don't necessarily know who will becoming in, those of us on the ground feel we have a real opportunity to do some cultural work that truly impacts.

When discussing the possibility of having ITC on campus over a year ago, I shared with Sean my perspective on some of the cultural/structural dynamics at play at SSU, and in particular how those in positions of power tended to privilege modern/market-driven solutions. I mentioned that I found some of their processes/moves useful for the University and others short-sighted, if not deeply problematic. But what I shared the most with Sean was that the dissonance and transitions at SSU felt like a great opportunity to help shape the University in a positive way. And it has proved so thus far for my work there. The HUB has spearheaded a number of programs and initiatives these past three years that focus on the overall development of the student and community, especially those that are underserved. Most of these have been deeply informed by integrative thinking and praxis, which for me includes important conversations about intersectionality, inclusion, and expanded notions of social justice/change. (I will be talking about the HUB's work at ITC, and am happy to share more about it later on this thread.)

This is all to say that the partnership between MetaIntegral and the HUB at SSU developed in a thoughtful, informed, and intentional manner. The partnership and design of ITC is deeply informed by a shared desire to be more on-the-ground, relevant, inclusive, engaging, and, well - impactful.

Thanks for the important questions and opportunity to offer my perspective. I definitely welcome the opportunity to learn about your integrative and social justice work: What are you all doing within and/or outside of existing systems/structures that enacts the kind of social change you feel we need at this time?

Warmly,
Mark"

          As a follow up, Michael Schwartz has a relevant post* at the Facebook version of Integral Postmetaphysical Spirituality forum.  I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and assuming that like all of us the gravity well of embeddedness in the capitalist structure is mostly invisible. Nonetheless it is incumbent on us to bring it to light and do something about it. Michael said:

""[I]n my experience at my now research university, itself part of the widespread trend of reconfiguring itself on neoliberal business models (where the rising costs of tuition, from the educational side, is not faculty salaries, but the mad increase of managerial and supporting staff positions, where these now outnumber faculty on more and more campuses, and where faculty are increasingly adjunct hence a disposable work force for this cancer like managerial growth), at my U, people I have known for many years, who are highly developed in any integral sense (we ran an integral pilot for the lead administrators and they embraced it, while scoring very high on the Lectica testing from the outset), and who are exemplary human beings, such people now in administrative roles are acting and speaking in ways that are more or more set by the new set of university structures, to an extent that they do not even begin to recognize to what extent they are being in the world so differently (while faculty see these changes in their acting and speaking , in some cases the shift being dramatic and even leading to memory loss for those valued souls); even as these wonderful people enact their administrative roles from highly developed levels of being; and yet still, in cases, act and speak in what I believe could be demonstrated to be ideological ways. I am sure I too act in these less than critical, pre-structured ways proper to these finacialized-reductions of educational values, even on my side much or most of the time would be my guess."

          I have a sincere question for Sean and the ITC. How do they address this article?* Therein SSU has been "quite literally turned over to the exigencies of the private capital market and Wall Street bond underwriters with reckless abandonment." Should that not be a topic of considerable inquiry if ITC is serious about trying to "catalyze effective change," since holding the conference there financially supports this corporate agenda at SSU? Is it consistent with their theme?

          Dear Eric and Sean,
Thank you for sharing your conversation. I use integral theory in my work as a leadership coach in Asiawhere I have lived for the past three decades. Your conversation struck a chord with me, especially the part about the exploring integral impacts, which is the focus of the upcoming conference. 
My question is how you will take examples outside North America into your review, including in Asia. After experiencing my own 'coming home' experience when discovering Ken Wilber and Don Beck's work, it appears to me that most of the integral discourse is still focused on North America, and to a lesser extent on the UK and Spanish-speaking countries. My experience is that while integral thinking can benefit people on all continents, its application has a lot to do with bridging between languages and cultures. If we could widen the discourse to explore application in different languages, including Chinese and other Asian languages, we might spark a wider interest and generate more impact. 
If you know of colleagues with such an interest, I would appreciate it very much if you could connect me with them. 
Best regards,
Wouter Lincklaen Arrins

          In form and content, this chapter [2, by R. Michael Fisher] is one of my favorites a very creative approach. Fisher was clear about how much work men have to do (including men in the Integral community).I appreciate his ability to empathize with women. My only suggestion: Fisher states that he is an integral feminist, I can imagine what that means by his discourse in this chapter, and yet I wish he had defined this directly.  Diana Claire Douglas (2015)

I appreciate the thorough embrace and critiques offered by Douglas (2015) on this book (Nicholson and Fisher) of which I have a chapter and in which I constructed the Index. I wish to respond to Douglass question above that zooms-in on what one always has so little space to discuss in a chapter of limited size when so many other points command attention. Shes wanting more juicy definitional and meaningful nuance in how I locate myself in my chapter. Rightfully so; her call is one for not just me to answer, but I think for all who call or are thinking of calling themselves an integral feminist. With the short space of this comment box, Ill make a brief outline of how I conceptualize this for myself as an identity within the feminist discourse(s) and beyond. 

To state the practical first, then the theoretical framework second, I have to say that my desire to be an integral feminist, is one of longing for a better and better discourse on feminism and a lived sense of my relationship to that discourseand I mean discourse in the full Foucauldian sense, not just some abstraction. A discourse of feminist persuasion is embodied in how I relate/empathize(?) to my cells, senses, perceptions and obviously my sexuality in all its dimensions from values, thinking, feelings, emotions, and how I go about having sex with whomever I choose, including myself. It is felt female/feminine even in a male body. Theres still lots to learn about that (including full-body nurturing collaborative m/otherly (matrixial) orgasm transcending human-centric imaginaries), and yes, all those words are troubling on their own--but my experience is not troubling so much as I know it as so different than being raised in a male sexual body/dominant discourse. In my chapter I mention that I have gone through several internal subjective trans experiences to become a 60:40 male, meaning 60% female and 40% male, even if that may not be seen in stereotypical or biological change, it is there! Its a huge commitment, at times near sadistic as oppression is more deeply understood within the pathological patriarchy. I feel unraveled in a good way, sometimes a terrifying way, but a desirous way to embody herstory as well as history. I get into the skin of femaleness, you may want to say it in those terms. It means, to a large degree getting out of male privilege as much as that is possible in embodied ways. Being a full-blooded artist helps me in this trans journey (but thats a larger topic).

Theoretically: integral consciousness (as many have labeled), as something I experience and live into continually, not straightforwardly, invites me to critique and understand everything (both in my agency and communal modes), especially when it seems to be a construction of feminine, female, woman, feminist that is perhaps stuck in its own viewpoint and becomes an ideology (ism disease). I really prefer critical differential integral feminist (fifth-wave?) to nuance my identity, subjectivity, and place I write from most always. The critical keeps my sensitivity to my need to educate myself on oppression and liberation all the time, in the classical sense and postmodern sensethats good feminism in general. And the more newly discovered differential feminism and differential consciousness I take more or less from Sandoval (2000), where a feminist standpoint is shown to operate in very unique situated environments primarily (more typical, agues Sandoval of third-wave feminism). I wont go on and on. I think a fourth-wave feminism is contested still, secular and spiritual (e.g., transpersonal and/or nondual) versions no consensus. To say it bluntly, a critical differential integral feminist is operating on a theory of fearlessness and fearless standpoint theory (another long story of exploring the value of 2nd-tier conceptualizations), because that is why and how feminism means anything really important to me. I agree with some of the most staunch feminists (e.g., Andrea Dworkin) who continually named the pathological patriarchy as glued together by fear (fearism)that insight too often is still forgottenand men and those who perceive and think and act like men too often remain blind to. Integral consciousness (e.g., Wilbers version) clearly shows a developmental journey from fear to fearlessness, to fearless a long road in terms of stages of growth, and an exciting road, in terms of state experiences (another topic). For more recent embodiments and theorizing of my interests in differential-integral consciousness in anti-oppression work and the issue of fear and females (see Fisher 2014, 2015).

The paper was called; THE NEGATIVE TENDENCY OF THE MENTAL PRESENTMENT. ITS SELECTIVITY, COLLECTIVITY AND IMPARTATION IN AMPLIFICATORY  RECIPROCITY;
 I bought a dictionary to write it and I still had to make up a few words. There was nothing in it about how to deal with the situation. I have only found page 1. Although I still like the title. I hope you do to, Natasha.

          Ah, Ian, what a marvelously inspiring and vulnerable and thought-provoking exploration! Thank you! Many responses arise in me, and I will include a few right here.
Is a professional a professional a professional? I suspect there are some professions who are more receptive to your approach. Look for the lowest windmills, LOL! Another low windmill might be "professionals" who abound within the Integrally-informed community, have you not found an interested ear there?

A lot of "dots" occur to me as related in my head, and perhaps relevant for your further explorations. I heard echoes here of what little I know of Diane Hamilton's Integral Facilitator training, which I gather emphasizes "showing up" as a group leader, as one's FULL self. I also wonder about the possible relationship of what you're describing to the "Presence-Centered Evolutionary Leadership" concept (possibly dormant) program from Alain Gauthier, Terri O'Fallon and others. In fact, I think you're right in surmising that perhaps "leadership" is the arena of Integral interest in which matters of your interest are being explored, experimented with, and addressed. Do you think so?

On a more meta-level, in my own informed but admittedly idiosyncratic interpretation of SD, concern with embodying practices actually doesn't kick in bigtime until Turquoise moving into Coral. So perhaps you are more ahead of the curve than you even thought. (As I suggest here: http://exploringsecondandthirdtier.blogspot.com/2013/11/third-tier-we-spaces-coral-and-teal.html

" We might say [about Coral We-space consciousness] that the state of emergent collective consciousness-field is becoming a state-stage. It tends to emerge in individuals when they are in the least proximity to one another, without practice and without consciously adopting or abiding by injunctions, which have become habits now. Individuals experienced in CORAL We-space, tend to act as automatic inducers so the phenomenon starts to show up via transmission or radiation, in other contexts of their life,..." (Can't find a more focused quote right now.)

However, that natural move into Coral consciousness around shifting from practices into embodying (which reaches completeness IMO only in the next stage, 2nd stage of 3rd tier, Teal, in SD colors) CAN I suspect be "translated down" to hook up with some of the natural movements from Green into Integral, such as willingness to expand perspectives and see wholeness at least as "systems" or as a broader grouping of "us."

Finally, a few more dots:
Mikyo Clark's chapter on Leadership in the book The Coming Waves - Evolution, Transformation, and Action in an Integral Age, and Andrew Venezia's Master's thesis I, We, All: Intersubjectivity and We Space, Post-Metaphysics, and Human Becoming both seem to me to reflect wonderful descriptions/examples of the kind of very "whole" approach to being a professional which you are describing.

          The covers on our Integral Leadership Review-Canada came about through many people - firstly through the Artist and Copyright Holders in the caption above. Then through Janice Simcoe who obtained their permission and wrote beautiful article http://integralleadershipreview.com/12516-115-circle-aiijaakag-circle-maangag-integral-theory-indigenous-leadership/.  Then it was protyped by Architect and Graphic Designer Amy Oliver. And finally adapted into its final form by Jeannie Carlisle. Thank you to this whole constellation of artists for your contributions.

          This framework could be enriched by considering the work of other researchers who are doing applied research on reasoning and argumentation. For many of these researchers, the terms "argument" and "dialogue" are not opposed as they are in this article; "argument" for these researchers simply refers to how statements are organized within a dialogue, and arguments are organized differently within different types and subtypes of dialogue (e.g., Walton and Macagno, 2007). I'm reminded of Bernard Mayer's phrase: "Genuine dialogue is not possible if we are not willing to engage in argumentation about our most important issues" (Mayer 2004). Here are some examples of this kind of research:

          Thanks for your thoughts Charles. You point to a really important distinction. In training Integral facilitators we are definitely interested in helping individuals learn to orient from stable open awareness to be able to respond skillfully and not reactively (as in the "fixing" mode you mention), to what is in the moment. How we orient to the actual group experience - which can definitely manifest as shared anxiety, difficult emotions, disruptive behaviors - can be greatly informed by having presence and perspectives. The absolute and the relative are not separate, even as we meet the group and help them fulfill their intention.

With appreciation for your interest, Rebecca
