        Fairies and UFOs?

        - By Ken Korczak

        he most popular belief today is that UFOs are
            spaceships piloted by aliens from outer space.
       </p>
       <p>
        But another good theory which never gets as much press is that
            which says UFOs may, in fact, be right here from earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of being Extraterrestrials, UFO aliens might be
            Ultraterrestrials -- a species that has always been here, which
            evolved on earth along with homo sapiens, but which represents a
            species far superior.
       </p>
       <p>
        These Ultraterrestrials are so superior to us it's almost
            impossible for us to comprehend their existence. All we know of
            them are fleeting glimpses of lights in the sky, occasional bizarre
            encounters between human beings and so-called aliens, and other
            unexplained phenomenon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Think of how a group of monkeys in the wild perceive human beings.
            Because their own level of consciousness is so limited, they cannot
            comprehend that we humans are beyond being just another kind of
            animal. They may see a jet or a helicopter or a car, but to the
            monkeys, nothing in their consciousness can explain these amazing
            things.
       </p>
       <p>
        A monkey may think of an airplane as some kind of magical giant
            bird. They relate to it with the level of understanding they have
            about their environment. The speculation of the monkey, at best, is
            a crude idea about the total truth of an airplane, and the fact it
            represents entire levels of consciousness that are so advanced,
            they are literally invisible to monkey mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now think of a human being who encounters a UFO. To us a UFO seems
            to be some kind of flying, mechanical aircraft -- but the true
            nature of the UFO may be as different from a spacecraft as a bird
            is from an airplane. Like the monkey, we just don't have the
            advanced levels of consciousness we need to comprehend the true
            nature of a UFO.
       </p>
       <p>
        As humans, we make the naturally egotistical assumption that we are
            the species at the top of the heap -- we see ourselves as the peak
            of achievement of evolution. We even make the bold claim that God,
            the supreme architect of the entire universe, created us in his own
            image!
       </p>
       <p>
        But it's not a big leap to consider that we are just another link
            in a vast chain of species, many which are below us, and some which
            may be above us.
       </p>
       <p>
        People who support the Ultraterrestrial theory point out that
            supernatural beings seemingly superior to humans have been reported
            throughout history. In previous eras they were called gods, angels,
            ogres, fairies, brownies, little people, demons, and more.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bible is filled with references to supernatural creatures,
            including giants, "wheels" flying in the sky out of which
            incredible creatures emerge, and more.
       </p>
       <p>
        But references to flying disks were recorded centuries before the
            texts of the Bible. Cave drawings dating to 30,000 B.C. depict
            numerous drawings of disks floating around in the sky, remarkably
            similar to modern UFO photographs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some maverick UFO investigators have pointed out the amazing
            similarities of modern UFO aliens to that of elves, fairies and the
            various "little people" famous in the folklore of many cultures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fairies are well known for kidnapping people, the same irritating
            habit UFO aliens have. People who are abducted report incidents of
            missing time, a phenomenon very similar to time lapses reported by
            people taken to and returned from "fairyland".
       </p>
       <p>
        Fairies, like modern aliens, tend to be diminutive creatures with
            large magical eyes. Many reports of alien abduction even include
            "power rods" used to paralyze abductees, just as fairies wield
            "magic wands".
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most interesting comparisons between aliens and fairies
            is that both are interested in stealing babies. One of the most
            common fairy activities is swiping babies from cribs, and sometimes
            replacing them with a false double, or "changeling" as they are
            sometimes called.
       </p>
       <p>
        A large part of modern UFO literature involves aliens abducting
            women, impregnating them, and later abducting them again, only to
            remove and take the unborn baby right out of the womb.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly, both UFO occupants and fairies have a strong affinity for
            the baby stealing business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fairies are closely associated with nature, just as modern aliens
            also display a certain obsession with environmental issues. One of
            the most common alien abduction scenarios involves aliens who force
            people to watch "movies" depicting massive environmental
            degradation caused by modern human civilization. The aliens then
            give them a lecture on environmental issues and let them go.
       </p>
       <p>
        If aliens truly are a superior species from earth and evolved on
            earth, it would make sense that they would be concerned about
            another species wrecking the planet.
       </p>
       <p>
        But then you might ask, why don't the Ultraterrestrials simply step
            in and "manage" us the same way humans "manage" wildlife, including
            chimps and other large primates? The Ultraterrestrial theorists
            answer: "They are!". That's what all the abduction and experiments
            are about!
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as human beings capture and tag various species, UFO abductees
            report experiences of extreme similarity. Many people report being
            "tagged" during frightening sessions on a UFO operating table. Some
            of these "tags" have even been recovered, or show up on MRI exams,
            and remain unexplained.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also possible that Ultraterrestrials comprehend and operate
            within higher levels of dimension than we experience at the human
            level. A monkey could never understand that time and space are
            actually two parts of the same dimension, as scientists have
            discovered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mathematicians tell us that many additional dimensions of reality
            exist  dimensions which only the most brilliant math minds
            can glimpse through numbers, although they cannot experience them
            psychologically in any meaningful way.
       </p>
       <p>
        If Ultraterrestrials can exist "above" or "beyond" spacetime, that
            means they can easily see us, trick us and manipulate our
            existence, while we can't see them at all, or only in the most
            crude manner, or perhaps only when they allow us to see them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Imagine when a bear is shot with a drugged dart from a helicopter
            hovering above him. Imagine how terrified the bear is of the
            bizarre flying monster and the noise and lights that come out of
            it. Now imagine that the bear thinks of the strange beings that
            come out of the flying monster. The strange beings poke and prod
            him, look inside his mouth, apply a tag to his ear, and then let
            him go. Why?
       </p>
       <p>
        How can a bear understand or interpret the meaning of this incident
            on its level of consciousness? It can't. It just seem to make any
            sense. Human beings are so advanced and superior as to
            incomprehensible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is it so difficult to believe that the ongoing bizarre and
            seemingly incomprehensible phenomenon of UFOs and their activities
            are the actions of an earth-born species far advanced and superior
            to human beings?
       </p>
       <p>
        Just ask a bear or a monkey.
