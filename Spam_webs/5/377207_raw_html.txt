     On a cold and rainy night, you are sitting at home, warm and comfortable. You decide to make a trip to the store, so you eagerly put on your rain gear. You leave... on your bicycle!
    </p>
    <p>
     Sounds crazy? Not too crazy, I hope. This website's goal is to help you use a bike as practical transportation, no matter what the conditions outside. However, even if you restrict your bicycle commuting to sunny days, there is plenty of information for you here.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you must drive because your commute covers a long distance, you can still rely on bicycling to avoid traffic jams near to your destination. Just bring a bike with the car, and pull off your route when you reach the very slow traffic. After you park the car, finish the commute with your bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why would you want to travel by bicycle? There are myriad possible reasons, including a desire to:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      clear your mind and become more alert in the morning
     </li>
     <li>
      reduce gasoline expenses
     </li>
     <li>
      get by with fewer cars in your household, or live entirely car-free
     </li>
     <li>
      have alternate transport when your car is being repaired
     </li>
     <li>
      take your time shopping for a replacement car after your old one died
     </li>
     <li>
      avoid traffic jams and having to check traffic reports
     </li>
     <li>
      avoid parking fees or at least avoid hunting for a space to park
     </li>
     <li>
      get more exercise
     </li>
     <li>
      help reduce the pollution created by automobiles
     </li>
     <li>
      enjoy scenery
     </li>
    </ul>

     This site was created with a southern California perspective. I have no experience with
     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bicycle+ice+snow">
      biking on ice and snow
     </a>
     , so I do not talk about that. Also, my discussion assumes that traffic travels forward on the right-hand side of a road. If you live in a left-hand drive country, you will have to sometimes swap the words "right" and "left" when I use them. Mostly, though, the information here applies to any cyclist.

     This site was also created from the perspective of a non-parent. There are

     to help you choose the best way to make bicycle trips with your children.

     Before you explore this site, I encourage you to learn the
     <a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/devices/bike/label/labelanswers.shtml">
      names of bike parts
     </a>
     , which might be mentioned within this website. If you see a word or phrase you don't know, check a
     <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/glossary.html">

     After reading through this website, you might feel like bike commuting demands a lot of time and money to get properly equipped. Actually, I think it's possible to defer buying a lot of the gear until you're sure you want commute regularly. Also, if cycling causes you to drive less, your car expenses should decrease noticeably; you'll probably save enough money to pay for excellent gear.
