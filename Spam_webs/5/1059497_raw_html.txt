The 30-foot-tall marble statue was built in 1920 by sculptor Daniel Chester French. Lincolns figure is seated in a large armchair, gazing ahead and slightly tilting his head down, with a serious expression on his face. There is even some folklore surrounding the famous statue, such as Confederate General Robert E. Lees face is carved onto the back of Lincolns head and blended into his hair.

            : The Dying Gaul is an ancient Roman copy of the lost Hellenistic sculpture from approximately 230 and 220 BC. The statue depicts a dying Celt who was defeated in battle against the Romans. The intricate details of the statue, particularly in the face, show strong emotion and expressive pathos that have made the statue a classic model even to this day. The original was thought to be bronze, but the original sculptor remains unknown. The famous copy is on display in the Capitoline Museums in Rome.
