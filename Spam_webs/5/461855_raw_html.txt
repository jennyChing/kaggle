          Guys,
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I understand why nobody really discuss this type of photography. But as this is "death and taxes" in our lives, I might as well as start this thread (hopefully useful someday).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          1) Who's the main subject especially if you want to create a photojournalistic approach? (In wedding photography, it's the bride).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          2) How to get creative shots out of it?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          3) General flow from vigil to burial?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          However morbid it may sound (to some), I hope for your inputs and comments. By the way, I absolutely won't go commercial with this but just curious about ideas/practices floating out there.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Thanks!

           I suspect that it's regarded as a breach of etiquette to take pictures at a funeral, which is a pity, since often people gather at funerals who almost never see each other at other times.  The last funeral that I went to, I had my camera in my pocket, but I didn't take any pictures.

            I suspect that it's regarded as a breach of etiquette to take pictures at a funeral, which is a pity, since often people gather at funerals who almost never see each other at other times.  The last funeral that I went to, I had my camera in my pocket, but I didn't take any pictures.

           I would think the best time to take pics is after the service, once people gather to have food and a chat.  People are usualy more relaxed once the event is 'over' so to speak.  I agree with OZinOH that it may come across quite rude to take pictures during the service/burial and may be upsetting to the family, certainly NO FLASH to be used.

           I've had taken pictures on my daughter's funeral (8 month old baby) because there were a few really close friends who could not attend the service. Years later, I like to see the photos again. Especially on a day like this, everything is a blur at that time.

           It must the idea that you don't take pictures at a funeral. People like to have photos from all important moments in their lives, why not a funeral? It did not upset me that a friend/photographer took pictures. But this is my personal opinion. Everyone has their own feelings or need to do certain things their way.

           I recently attended a funeral where there was a photographer present.  At first I thought my god....and then after initial shock i looked around at the crowd and realised there were people from afar who wouldnt normally have had the chance to catch up with one another for years.

           I tihnk capturing the people in attendance and the friends and family coming together was a good visiual record of the Service and a memory for the family to look back on once the greiving process has ended.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I do agree however that it 'feels' like death is being exploited, but possibly a trend that will grow into a business..  we record births, special days, anniversairies, marriages why not complete the story with photographs of death.  Afterall in a lot of cases (if we are indeed fortunate enough) its a celebration of life!

I tihnk capturing the people in attendance and the friends and family coming together was a good visiual record of the Service and a memory for the family to look back on once the greiving process has ended.

I do agree however that it 'feels' like death is being exploited, but possibly a trend that will grow into a business..  we record births, special days, anniversairies, marriages why not complete the story with photographs of death.  Afterall in a lot of cases (if we are indeed fortunate enough) its a celebration of life!

           I'm not sure on this one.. many people actually stopped talking to me when they found out I had a job selling cemetery plots. It's just something people don't like to think on... their own inevitable immortality. But I would personally welcome the idea, as long as not done in distaste. I did attend a funeral once (of a 12-year old), in which her boyfriend's mom posed him by her coffin, and took pictures of him leaning in and kissing her. I was definitely taken aback by that.

           a hundred years ago the photographer was the first place that a person was taken to after their body was prepaired for the funeral, I don't know when or why this changed, and it became odd to take a photo of a family member that you won't see again, I wish I had more photos of friends and family that have passed away

           The whole point of burying someone is to have a place to return. Visiting a cemetery is remembering the death not remembering the life of the person. If taking pictures at a funeral is morbid, then so is visiting a grave. Consumerist society has taught us a very unhealthy denial of death.

           However, I wouldn't take pictures myself a the funeral of a very close relative, being behind the lens creates a distance to reality, it can be a way for someone to remove themselves from what is happening, and that's not healthy. I'd say get a picture of the deceased, if the body is in a good shape, especially for an older person, grandchildren will appreciate, years later, I would have. Not the place to get creative though. Perhaps there shouldn't be a main subject, you don't need 20 pictures of a crying widow. Just don't ask anybody to pause and smile.

           I was reading a photography book in Borders last week and there was a section of photos taken at funeral homes of people all dressed up in their sunday best.  It looked quite nice and tasteful to me.

           As odd as it is to take photos at a funeral I have people in my family who have photos of the deceased.  It seems to have been more common at one time.   The people who have these photos are 80+ years old.  Some of them have the photos framed and everything.  There is just something about a close up of a person in a coffin that creeps me out though.  I guess it's kinda like kissing the person as well.

           I think it depends on the closeness of your relationship to the deceased and the overall atmosphere of the funeral.  In general, as long as the photography is done in a discrete and respectful way I don't think there is anything wrong with it.

           There are many funeral events that deem a photographer appropriate, such as funerals where most of the family is not able to attend or funerals that have some significance beyond the normal.  I am a police officer and have unfortunately attended many funerals for downed fellow officers.  These type funerals are of a military style and
           <b>
            very

           ceremonial. I know that's redundant because all funerals are a ceremony, but if you have ever been to a military or police funeral, you would understand that there are many opportunities for some very powerful and touching photographs.  These are usually huge events and photographers are not offensive.  So, I say all that to say this.  There is a justification for seeking techniques and advice on how to shoot a funeral.   The only advice I can think of is invest in or rent a two very fast lenses, so that you can get shots without flash.  One of the lenses needs to be a long one because funerals like the ones I mentioned often prevent you from getting many good close vantage points.  Discretion and sensitivity is the key so taking shots from afar will keep folks from knowing that they are being shot and therefore from being offended that you getting them at their most difficult time.

           During my short time on this earth, I've only been to a few funerals.  But I have been to a funeral w/ a photographer.  It was a Vietnamese family who lost their son in a car accident.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I remember I felt very strange/uneasy about a professional photographer being there.  It just didn't seem right.  So my mind said, "it must be a cultural difference".  Could there be any truth to that?

           Personal point of view- Photography is about memories, as long the photographer pay respect, to the funeral. In Asia most of us do carry a camera phone. I would like a 'pro photographer' to record my last journey on earth in still image.  So that it could pass on to the next generation. it won't be an easy job to photograph a funeral...

           Recently shot group portraits of family members during reception after the service. Ten brothers and sisters with their extended families brought together from all points of the country was a rare enough occasion to warrant the effort to record.
           <br/>
           Here's a curious irony though in having avoided intruding on one of the most private moments of this somber occasion. The deceased was my companions own mother, whose spouse of over 60 years suffers from Alzheimer's. I was tempted but refrained from discretely capturing the poignant scene when her Dad was wheeled to the side of his life long  companion open casket. Even though he spent more than 20 minutes grieving with his hand over hers,... by the time the funeral moved to actually lowering her into the grave, he was asking who the person was being buried? He was even asking, "was she married?"
           <br/>
           This devastating disease prevented her Father from retaining the memory of his ever having been at his own dear wife's funeral. In hindsight, the discreet shots I conscientiously avoided taking of him by the casket may have been reassuring later. As he painfully accused his sons and daughters of leaving him out of the very lovely service altogether.
           <br/>
           So,... if I knew then, what I know now,... tragic on so many levels.

           Sad story, Boopala. I suppose it's the whole approach thing.... I'd think that pictures taken when the coffin goes into the grave, or into the furnace, would be a bit distasteful to 'Western' attitudes. And perhaps even any pictures up to that point.
           <br/>
           Pictures of the covered grave, with its flowers, is fine, I think. The vast amount of flowers over my wife's grave was a quite amazing sight and had to be recorded. Then it's a matter of recording the reunion of a long-lost family - and I'm sure they don't mind some pictures once the tears have gone. And they've had tea.

           I think it's a cultural issue.  I was asked to take pictures at a funeral in New Orleans.  The deceased was my husband's great-aunt and this was the first time I had attended a funeral in New Orleans.  I grew up in the north and had never heard of such.  I was taken aback, but obliged.  It wasn't a bad experience, but I know that it was only because I had never met the deceased before.

           Over the years I have attended many funerals in New Orleans and I have seen people taking pictures at each and every one.  All were taken by attendees, never a professional and the shots were of the body during the viewing period, not the actual service.  I've never experienced it anywhere else, but I think it's a great idea.

           Tho this is a very touchy subject.. there is actually a site for this.  BUT it is for new born and premie infants who will sadly never make it home from the hospital.  This is a growing trend and some areas are accepting it with minimal head turning.   If your interested in this type of journalism... they are looking for photographers as well but they do have a training course.... and you would provide the services for free if Im not mistaken.

           I looked through a few of these photos at Sandy Pucs Tots 2 Teens photo seminar and knowing that most of these precious children were already passed or will soon... just broke my heart.  I had to stop looking tho the images were absolutely beautiful and tastefully composed.   It is very emotional whether your looking at the photo or acting photographer.  I spoke to a few who have done this several times and they have yet to make it thru a session dry eyed.  I would suppose not... I know I wouldnt be able to.

           I have done several funerals.  They are in films.  Most are B/W and some in colors.

           My grandfather pass away about 10 years ago.  I was going to take some pictures for my own records.  But my aunt told me not to.  I regret everyday now for not taking the pictures.  I don't want that happen to other people.

           I have done several funerals.  They were close friends and family.  Interesting enough, they all have very positive reactions about the photos.  I showed it to some friends, at first, they were shocked with the subject matter.  But at the end, they all have a reaction as in very "peaceful"    Some thank me after 3 years for taking the priceless photos because, without it, there wouldn't be any memories.That was my approach of being peaceful and the outcome was the same.
           <br/>

           I am not going to discuss the technique.  That part you will have to be creative about it.  If you want to see it, please email me. Stephenhung@hotmail.com

           I don't know how I would feel if somebody tried to take my picture at a funeral, but it's not exactly the day when I would like to gather with my relatives and smile in front of a camera...

           Also I don't understand why some people take pictures of the one who died....I mean, do they really want to have a memory with them  in a coffin? Personally I want to remember people what they were like before they died.

           I took this photo at a friend of my mother's who died earlier this year.  Miss Sarah loved her hats and the family place them on the casket at the funeral home and then in front of it at the grave site.  I took this photo and then took photos of her entire family together afterwards because they all were from different states and most likely will not get together again or if so not real soon.  She would have loved the photos because she loved her family.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           On the other hand, I have come across photos of my grandparents taken at funerals and they were of the actual person in the casket (even one of a baby).  That to me is strange, I would much rather remember them alive.  They also used to take photos at the cemetery sitting on markers, again a little unusual to me.  But to each his own.  I think the main factor should be what the family wants.

           It was rather weird for me a couple weeks ago. My uncle had died. The little bit of family that could make it to the funeral knew I had my cameras with me. They asked if I could shoot for those who couldn't make it. The first few shots were rather awkward, as i didn't know what to shoot. As I relaxed though, I just started shooting what I saw. Family grieving, it was a military service, so the flag ceremony, 21 gun salute &amp; a few overview shots.

           I believe this is actually a really good topic but it depends a lot on the family I guess:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           While many think this is NOT a good time to take photos, to others (like me) it can also be a way to snap that last moment for those who couldn't make it to the ceremony or as a memento for the future or even as a way to record one last not happy yet VERY important moment as it's somebody's dead and important in somebody else's life. I believe both views are right and respect to both is important.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Now wether on what to focus I'd believe it is useful to have two kinds of photos one of the mourners(family and friends) and other of what happens around the deceased person.. or of the deceased person him/herself if family believes it to be oportune; and always in a very respectful way beacause it's not a party it's a timet of grief.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Since it is a very solemn moment in many cultures, that is what photos should reflect; it may not necessary be of people standing for a photo, it can also be more of candid photography around the ceremony;  people will not likely stand at a funeral and smile and rather than to take pictures of people crying out loud, it's important to reflect the overall mood of a funeral, the reflectiveness for some, the emotiveness of others, etc, all in good manners and respect.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Some moments that might be nice to shoot are those wich are more important during the ceremony or funerary rites, taking TiltedGlass for example: if it's a military service, there's the flag ceremony, 21 gun salute, other could be the moment when the funerary casket is to be buried or it there are other kinds of special moments or rites during the ceremony then there might be possible shots.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Remember to respect if some people does not want his/her photo taken; ask first to the closest family if photographs should be taken and if family and friends consider it not to be a good time put down the camera; it may also be a hard time for youself so take that into consideration too.

           When my sister's husband died unexpectedly in 2000, at 38 years old, a big shock, she was trying to take a few pictures before the service for their friends back home. He was from Ohio and moved to SC to go to college then settled in NC. One of the funeral directors brought her a chair and told her to stand in the chair and it would make a better picture. He was right. The only other pictures were taken at the reception.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           SVImages, I love the honoring of Miss Sarah with the hats. That picture was emotionally moving for me. I wonder if they were buried with her or if the women of the family each got one as a keepsake?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           You mentioned the pictures your Grandparents had of people in caskets, even a baby. My Grandmother had pictures of my Grandfather and was going through her pictures one day and threw them away. Said she didn't know why she even had them made. I never knew him. He was a photographer, so there are plenty pictures of everybody else and not many of him.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Also, my Mom and Dad have a portrait of their first-born child, a boy. He just looks asleep in a small bassinet. I'm glad they have it because my Mom was unable to attend the funeral. There is an uncanny resemblance between that baby and my oldest daughter as an infant. That's the only infant portrait they had made. My Mom was pregnant 7 times, the first two died after a few days. They were premature births. Then she had my sister in '58, me in '61, and my brother in '62, consecutively. The next pregnancy was another preemie and the last pregnancy was a miscarriage at 5 months. Her doctor told her to stop after that.
           <br/>

           Sorry I got so long winded. As far as funeral pictures, to each his own. The older I get the less it bothers me.

           I took some pictures in Feburary of at my cousins funeral. Done it for his grandmother because she wanted the pictures for later to show his sons when they grow up and start asking questions about their dad. One is about 7 or 8 and the other is now 14 months old. My main focus of the pictures were the casket and all of the flower arrangments and other things that were sent to the funeral. I shot all of my pictures before funeral started and people started arriving because his father and mother were set against pictures being taken but i understand why the grandmother wanted them to explain to the boys when they get old enough to understand why their dad is not here.

           I took photographs at my great-grandmother's funeral.  Not of my great grandmother - but because I realized at the time that my 90+ year old great grandfather would not be able to live without her.  Her death sent him into a wheel chair - and within 2 months he was gone.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           My grandmother at the time scolded me that it was inappropriate - and I told her that I wanted a picture of her and her dad as well as me and my dad all together not because I was morbid, but because to me, it shows how much we love and support each other even in times of great emotion (to me, death is as much a celebration as a birth).  It is the last family photo that we have of all of us - and now, she values it very much.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I think really, it's all in how it's presented and when it's done.  Naturally, I did this as we were leaving the cemetery, with all of us around my great grandmother's headstone.  Someday, when they're all gone, I'm sure that this will be a photo that I will be pleased to have back as well.

           I'm sorry,it could be a culteral thing,maybe not. Personally,i think it's s sick perverted thing people do to get their jolles. I recently experienced the loss of my grandchild, she was only 2 years old. It was such a tragedy for the whole family. Worse yet, it was my soon to be ex-husband that showed up with a video camera to take pictures and probably videos too. When confronted, he said he asked the parents for permission,I'm sure they were thinking clearly, don't you? He didn't bother to think anyone else would be offended.He will never be forgiven for his act of ignorance,selfishness and cruelty.I will asume people take pictures of the dead to make the living feel better for not be there for the deseased when they were alive.It's best to remember them as they were when they were alive.

           The only funeral-related photos I have taken have been shots of the grave and flowers after the body has been lowered and covered and the flowers placed on and around the grave.  In addition to shots of the grave and all the flowers, I also shoot the flowers individually.  This gives the family a good record to help remember what flowers were there and who sent them.  I have done this for friends and family and have never, ever, charged anything for the photos.

           When my grandfather died a little over a year ago my mother asked me to take photos of him and of the funeral. I was hesitant to do it, and felt awkward every time I clicked the shutter, but she is really grateful for the photos now. Which is what really matters I suppose.

           I've taken photos at quite a few funerals.  Though mostly military, some not ... some family, some not.  Not once has anyone ever implied to me that taking photos was offensive, in contrary, they have each greatly appreciated &amp; treasured having the photos.  Most, requested my taking photos ... when not asked, they assumed I would, therefore was glad I asked if they wanted me to, for they would have lost out on a wonderful keepsake of memories.  Many times one is so caught up in the moment of grief that they don't remember who was there or what took place.  Photos are a treasured keepsake, no matter the event.

           As long as it's respectful I don't see it as a problem.  It's like journalistic photography.  You're capturing the story.  A friend of mine took a few shots of another friend's funeral (firefighter who passed last year).  I couldn't make the service, but the pictures provided a powerful statement and provided me with a feeling that he and the family were well taken care of.

           A while ago I was asked to photograph a funeral. One family member could not attend, they were a continent away, so the family wanted a way to share the experience with them. The day was cold with mixed rain and snow; somehow appropriate to the overall mood. I took a photojournalistic approach, including both stills and video. While I felt awkward at the graveside, many people requested copies of the prints and video, which let me know it was appreciated by those who could be present as well as those who could not.  -Jerry

           I have been to several funerals where there were photos taken. there were only a few of the deceased, flowers, and casket with spray. The majority were of family, not at the service but at the graveside and reception. These should only be done with nthe blessing of the immediate family as some people feel differently about this.The photos are not about death, but a celebration of life and love.

           In my family, we photograph the deceased while on display, with family members present and without, and again at the final resting place.

           I really liked the photo of the hats at the gravesite from SVImages. When I first saw this post I was a little creeped out, but a nice photo like that where its more remembering something she liked as opposed to a photo of someone laying in a casket I think is more acceptable. My grandmother died last year and there were a lot of people there that I hadn't seen in a long time but I don't know that it's an excuse for a family portrait. Even if the whole family was together every time I would see that photo I would remember that we were together because of a very painful time and I don't think I would really want to remember my family like that, broken down and in pain. I would rather remember the good times.

           My dad is a funeral director/ mortician and has been one since before I was born.  I never have thought about photographing a funeral until recently. And I think I would have the funeral of my loved one professionaly photographed. If I was to die I would want mine photographed. I have 3 small children and I would want them to be able to look back on that if they chose to, instead of them wish they could remember and have all these questions. There is a tasteful way to photograph this and i think it would be something to treasure for the living. With all this in mind I think that it would need to be in it's own album.

           My father passed away 38 years ago today. I was only 2. I do remember things about him alive, but not much. Photos were taken of his funeral. To capture such moments is priceless. Frozen in time is the procession to the graveside, him lying in his casket, my mother crying, me accepting his flag instead of my mother because i had claimed it as my own, other family and friends (some of which I have never seen again) caught in their moment of remembrance and grief. That photo album means a lot to me no matter how odd it may seem.

           My mother passed away 3 years ago. Photos were taken by relatives and others. For once I didnt have my own camera with me....I was too grief stricken to remember much at that time. I have not seen a single photo from that day. No one sent anything to me, offered anything, etc. I guess you can say our family was not exactly close---her own relatives ignored me the entire day. Not a comfort shared between us, trust me I tried. So I don't have final photos of her beautiful pink rose coffin, people I will never see again (friends of my mothers and mine because we moved soon after the funeral), I don't even know if anyone took photos of the viewing (I was unable to attend due to personal reasons).

           It may seem odd taking photos of a funeral, of the dead, the grieving. But even in death there is beauty.

           There is a group of photographers that I believe is called No I Lay Me Down to Sleep that will go in and take pictures of still born babies and newborns that die shortly after birth so the parents have pictures of their deceased children.

           A couple of years ago a serviceman in town was killed in Iraq. They had a large military funeral for him and even had an antique horse drawn hearse for the funeral procession. It was quite the photo op, but I couldn't bring myself to taking pictures at it, even though there were plenty that did.

           I was asked to join that photography group here in town. My hubby told me I didn't have the right personality and would end up bawling my eyes out with the parents. I thought it might help me deal with some things. I may still look into it, sometimes that is all the parents have to remember the child by.

           I took images of my son when he died, i have the most amazing pictures of me holding my son in my arms as sadly he was taken before he took 1 breath on this earth. Those photos are all i have of him. We even photographed his funeral. I have had more children since and they all love looking at his album, they understand they had a brother who is now in heaven, it would be hard for them to understand that without pictures for them to relate too.

           When you loose someone so young so soon, so unexpected, you grab any oppertunity to create a lasting memory of them. When older people die, they have usually led a long and fulfilled life with lots of memories for people, so people dont feel the need to memorialise this part of their lives.

           I would have no problems photographing a funeral or attending one where a photographer was present.

           I understand how important those pictures might be in the grieving process and for many many years afterwards.

           I suppose the gravesite is the main subject. I've never asked or really heard this issue being discussed before but at my grandfather's funeral I only took shots from the hip. It just felt...wrong. I can't quite explain it. I remember hiding the camera from the priest too just because I felt I was committing some crime! But again, I can't put my finger on why it felt wrong.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Now, my father took pictures at his mother's burial but he didn't photograph the burial, just the people gathered that day. I never asked him why he omitted that part but I have a feeling it was something similar.

           This is not to speak against those who do photograph them, this is just how I personally felt, camera in hand. I find it fascinating some people take photos of stillborn children. Not in a bad way of course, I just never thought about it!

            I suppose the gravesite is the main subject. I've never asked or really heard this issue being discussed before but at my grandfather's funeral I only took shots from the hip. It just felt...wrong. I can't quite explain it. I remember hiding the camera from the priest too just because I felt I was committing some crime! But again, I can't put my finger on why it felt wrong. 

Now, my father took pictures at his mother's burial but he didn't photograph the burial, just the people gathered that day. I never asked him why he omitted that part but I have a feeling it was something similar.

           I have taken photos of two funerals in the past couple of years.  One was at the tragic death of the son of a friend of mine and the other of another friend of mine who died of cancer.  I did not know what to do for either family except give them a gift of memories, so I did that with my camera.  I only did so with the permission of the family however, and never used a flash.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I took photos at the wake and the funeral itself.  I tried to capture the genuine love and concern on the faces of those who came to pay their respects to the families.  As I viewed what was going on behind the lens of my camera I became so caught up in the emotions of what others were feeling that my creative talents just took over and somehow a beautiful story unfolded in pictures.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When it was all over I found a beautiful wooden photo box with divided slats of photo sleeves in it to display the photos in to present to the family.  They have cherished it and take it out and look at it when ever they want to have a moment alone with their son.  They have commented that those days were such a blur that they never would have "seen it" without those photos.  It turned out to be the best gift they ever received.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The other lady who died of cancer, I made a memory book out of and celebrated her courageous Faith as she fought so hard the battle of cancer for years.  I had been taking photos all along because we were close, so in the end I was able to put them in the book and present them to her husband along with the ones from the funeral.  He was so delighted with the book that he ordered 8 more books for other family members.  Every time he sees me he tells me how grateful he is for those photos.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Death is a natural part of Life....it's all part of memories. Why not photograph them.

           I don't look for photo opportunities like this, but they seem to find me!  I've been asked by two families to photograph the funerals of their loved ones.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I think the family's view of death and the afterlife is key in deciding if it's tasteful or not.  If the view is that death is THE.END, then the funeral might not be something that people want to remember with pictures.  But the Christian funeral (for example) is often a celebration of the person's life, their entering Heaven, and of Christ's victory over death.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Open casket or not, it can be done very tastefully....beautifully even.  I recommend capturing the "details" just as in a wedding - flowers, headstone, details of the casket, candles, etc.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I was asked specifically to capture photos of the deceased once.  I found that B&amp;W processing softened the look, and avoided focusing too much attention on the color of the person (which is often a bit off).  I also shot with a wide open aperture to capture folded hands while leaving the face out of focus.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gentleness...kindness...peace...consideration...and of course, technical ability - all important things a funeral photographer must bring with them to the service.

           This is a touchy one... to a photographer, or any other artist, we see the beauty in the sadness, and the gathering of loved ones to share in the memories &amp; grief- we're not out to take morbid pictures of dead people. (Which, incidentally, used to be one of the most widely used photographic practices! People used to pose their dead &amp; take portraits.)

           At my great grandmother's funeral, we released 88 helium balloons, with slips of paper inside with her name &amp; dates, and a scripture on the back. I asked a few family members what they thought of me taking a couple pictures of this, and they all loved the idea. I have to admit, I felt weird wearing my camera graveside. But I'm so glad I did!

           This is a great topic , DEATH PHOTOGRAPHY,  is not a new subject it has been with us every since the beginning of photography. And before that death was being portraied in painting. Personally i have photographed three funerals, all three were close family members. It did piss off some family members.

           very interesting topic. i'm originally from the philippines and a professional photographer and videographer would not raise any eyebrows at all. I think it's how cultures perceive death as a whole. for us, not only is it a time of grief, but a celebration of life. when i look at the photos from my grandfather's funeral, my heart always clenches and i welcome that feeling of remembered grief because it reminds me of how important he was to me. i now live in a small town in ireland where there is plenty of old traditions are ceremonies still practiced and how i wish it could be preserved for the family through photographs. when the family walks behind a hearse, do they notice that the shops have turned off their lights and closed their doors and windows as a sign of respect? did they notice the butchers, all in their starched uniforms, standing in front of their closed shop, green hats in hand? or the mourner clutching a posy of wildflowers in their hands?

           I've never seen a photo taken at a funeral, although, it has got to be an open market. Great niche. I say capitalize on it such as funeography has. I'd say you would just have to be careful that no one wants to smash your gear, like the photographer at the Corleone wedding in The Godfather.

           I believe that is good to take Photo's at funerals and wakes memories are important and sad times as well as good should be captured I have taken photo's at a number of relatives funerals and no one has ever raised a question.

           a Funeral should be a celebration of the persons life and times and I believe should be captured.

            I believe that is good to take Photo's at funerals and wakes memories are important and sad times as well as good should be captured I have taken photo's at a number of relatives funerals and no one has ever raised a question. 
a Funeral should be a celebration of the persons life and times and I believe should be captured.

           Funeral photography is a great idea, why not, we do photos at births, weddings ect ect, so why not funerals . . . maybe not get too creative and have the deceased sitting upright in the casket with their family members all standing around . . . . but . . .
           <br/>

           Interesting to read about the many viewpoints here. I grew up with funeral photography being normal.  Pics from funerals and wakes are in family albums and hung on walls. They are looked at and talked about without any feeling of morbidity.  To be honest, I didn't realize that it could be considered unacceptable.

           I photographed my Father in law's funeral. It was a gorgeous, military funeral for a man that had lived a full, happy life. I avoided any of him deceased, or of any particularly painful moments for his family, instead captured the guests, the ceremony, the location. He loved photography, so he would have been pleased. I also had almost 40 people request copies of the images.

           My father, a photographer like me, insisted that someone take photographs at the funeral of my mother during the viewing, church service, grave site service and reception. My wife, also a great photog, took most of the photos and did a wonderful job.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Having lived internationally for most of their lives, it was important to him to have a visual record of the event with 500+ people that came from all over the world to honor my mother's life. In addition, there were many people who couldn't come and the photographs provided some sense of connection for them as well.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I have photographed other funerals as well. Everyone has been grateful for the images.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <b>
            My suggestions:
           </b>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Ask the officiant/MC to introduce the photographer as being there at the request of the family. Emphasize that they requested your presence in order to help them/friends/family achieve closure as well as create a record of those who came to honor the deceased.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Use fast glass with a little reach so you can stand off a little and still capture important moments.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Don't be afraid to capture the emotion, that is what you are there for. The event is primarily an emotional one and must be documented accordingly.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Don't overshoot. Get your shot and lower the camera. It isn't a wedding so no machine gunning.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Be sure to take photos of each gift of flowers/wreaths-shoot a close-up of the card.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In some ways it is similar to shooting a wedding in that you have to shoot, the guests, location and ceremony. Many funerals even have a reception/meal afterward. Look for extended family shots there and try to take a photograph of each table.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Your demeanor should be respectful but not too serious.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I hope this helps, Ronald. It is a difficult shoot to do, but is a real service. I am so grateful to have the images my wife took of that important day.

           This certainly is a touchy subject. I am for taking photos of a funeral, but personally wouldn't want pictures of the deceased. My aim would be more of the grieving family and friends. I have never really thought about it before until I came upon this thread, there are moments of my mothers funeral that I would have loved to have a photograph of. One especially comes to mind. My two sons, my nephew and my niece all kneeling on the pew in front of my mothers urn and picture "talking" to Grammy. That is a memory I will NEVER forget, but a photo of that moment would have been VERY special.

           I have been asked to take some pictures at a friends funeral. A little nervous and don't wish to make the attendees feel awkward. Thanks for the insight, especially from el_trotamundo.

           today marks the 2nd time that I was asked to take photos of the wake and the funeral. First for my uncle who died two years ago and now to my bestfriend. I really find it difficult to reconcile what is ethical and what is not so I just fire away mostly without flash and looked for candid reactions of the attendees.

           I've photographed 9 funerals to date.  I always do so when asked and I never accept any payment .  I am 100% enthusiast, never planning to turn Pro.   I see it as a gift to the family.  The reasons I have been asked to capture the day were diverse, but the most common reason was so that images could be sent overseas to siblings and friends  too old to endure the journey to Australia.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I have a process.  I speak to the undertakers and get access to coffin before the rooms/church are open to the public and take shots, with flash of the coffin and the floral arrangements.  I take individual shots of the floral tributes showing the names so that those who can not attend see that they were represented.   I shoot nothing during the service and then I shoot the family and friends gathered after the service. I take both formal and informal images there.  People like group shots.  Especially where families are spread across the land.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I was also asked to photograph the funeral of a serving Police Officer by his Commander as part of the commemoration given to the family.  That was a big project with an incredible Guard of Honour.  At that service there were numerous family members taking photos too.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I guess to have those images to look back on is all part of the grieving process.  We record Births and Marriages, so this is just another aspect of life.

           At the last 2 funerals I attended, there was at least one person taking pictures.  I'm not talking about a professional photographer, but someone who was a family member or friend of the deceased.  I was not offended by it, but I did think it seemed awkward.  I would never have done it.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Even though the people were not taking pictures of the deceased (to my knowledge), I was reminded of a story I read about a guy who found a book of old photographs.  He noticed the pictures of the people looked a little strange.  It suddenly dawned on him that these were pictures of the recently deceased, posed as if still living.  Apparently, this was a common practice in Victorian times.  If you do a Google search on Victorian death photos (also called memento mori) you can learn about this type of photography, but personally I find it a little creepy.

           I shot a funeral a few years back for my husbands grand-mother.  His aunt really liked my photography (I'd been shooting her daughter for years) and asked me to do it.  I was more than willing to for the experience as I was curious what it would be like and how the pics would turn out.  I was very discreet, quiet, and most people barely noticed me taking pictures.  I stayed away from full-on casket pics, however, I took some of the details of the casket like the rosegold inlays around the frame because it was beautiful artwork on the part of the coffin-maker.  Also, I took pics of the flowers on the casket, with the deceased in the background - blurred.  That way, you could tell what the pic was, without getting graphic.  I also got a beautifully touching shot of the deceased's 3 small grandchildren peering over the casket to see "gramma".  They were standing side by side and I shot from behind.  Just the sillhouette of the little girls curiously looking at gramma.  It ended up being one of my favorite shots.
           <br/>
           I also got a photo of my husband, who helped read the eulogy, go over to his own father (the deceased's son) and give him a hug.  His father is not a "hugger" but the moment was so right.  Everyone loved that photo.  It was the only time during the funeral that his father cried.
           <br/>
           I got shots of the receiving line (full of emotion), the precession, the kids playing outside... just being innocent kids.  I got pics at the hillside burial which was in a small family cemetary that most of us had never been to.  I got shots of family members going through the cemetary looking at old relatives' graves.  It had a very historic feeling.  I also got a shot of a tiny little shack (about a hundred years old) next to the cemetary where the deceased had been born.
           <br/>
           When it was over, I very carefully and tastefully compiled the photos into an honorable slideshow set to very nice music.
           <br/>
           I also made sure to include in the slideshow the text from the eulogy (since most people forget what was said after a few days) and a poem and scriptures that were dear to the family.
           <br/>
           I waited until his Aunt was ready emotionally to see the slideshow. Then, several family members got together and we played it.  Everyone was very quiet except for the sound of grabbing a kleenex occasionally.  It went over really well, and to this day we all appreciate and view the slideshow from time to time.  My daughter (one of the kids in the silhouette) is now 9 yrs old and doesn't remember her gramma.  This slideshow helps.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I'm considering breaking into this field now.  I live in a rural town in the Bible-belt.  People down here (southwest Virginia) are big on funerals and pictures, so I think they will appreciate this service.  I plan on talking with some local funeral directors and pastors to see what they think.

           The key to success in this is ....... BE DISCREET and SYMPATHETIC!

The key to success in this is ....... BE DISCREET and SYMPATHETIC!

           A number of years ago a close friend who was also into photography asked me to help him record the funeral of a police officer who was killed in the line of duty. It took me awhile to say yes as I had some reservations about how I could tastefully and unobtrusively record such a heart wrenching event.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But I am so glad I had faith in myself and my partner to record such a moving moment in time. As a result of that experience we were called on again to record another funeral of a police officer killed in the line of duty. Shortly after that we recorded the funeral of a fireman who died from cancer.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In each opportunity we felt privileged to be chosen to record memories that we know the families cherish each and every day. I always kept in the back of my mind, if it was my funeral that was being photographed, what would I want my family to have as those lasting memories.

           Here is something I found on Flickr. I used to own a photofinishing business where photos of people in caskets was quite common. I was actually asked to take a picture of someone's son. It turned out he was dead and at a funeral home.
