          It must have been a warm night, because Blatty wasn't sleeping one inch away from Eddie's nostrils.
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         In his nearly two decades on earth, our Maine Coon cat, Blatty, saw the world, saved my marriage and enduredover-affectionatechildren to no end. To show our love to him as we buried him yesterday, we put a jingle ball and two of his favorite foods: bacon and Cheetos.
        </p>
        <p>
         He first came to us in 1996, about two years after he wandered into the New Orleans house of my Lovely Brides collegefriends roommate. When the roommatewas moving from New Jersey home to Pakistan, Blatty came to live with me as I was moving to New York. He spent his first days living on the sly in a Times Square hotel, where my employer put me up while I looked for an apartment. I begged the housekeepers not to rat me out, and only once or twice did Blatty escape into the hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
         He loved Alley Cat brand kitty kibble those first few days,buthe beelined to my lap when I had muffins or Cheetos. He would lick-lick-lick off all the salty cheesy orange dust and then abandon usto barf on the rug.We learned quickly what not to feed a cat.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our Pakistani friend named him for the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, a monster in The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy that was so stupid that you could defeat it by putting a towel over your head. If you couldnt see it, it couldnt see you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alrighty then.
        </p>
        <p>
         This cat saved my marriage. Only once, I think, but it was a big one.
        </p>
        <p>
         I proposed in December 1996, and when I had bought the ring, planned the trip, chosen the venue and popped the question, I was
         <em>
          READY
         </em>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Lets get married in October, I said. You know, football weather. It will be gorgeous.
        </p>
        <p>
         I drove my Lovely Bride to tears because I didnt know she had other plans. Apparently, all girls are born with the perfect wedding entirely planned in their heads, like Athena springing forth fully formed from the head of Zeus. Lovely had always wanted a spring wedding, with an off-white empire-waist dress with cap sleeves. And no way no how was she planning a wedding while she finished law school and studied for the barexam.
        </p>
        <p>
         Boy did I step in it with that one.
        </p>
        <p>
         She was in Washington, so I stuffed Blatty in the over-the-shoulder cat carrier and sneaked him on the Greyhound bus from New York, praying I wouldnt get busted and left on the side of the Jersey Turnpike. She didnt know I was coming. I hid when I knocked on her door and sent the cat sauntering in with a note on his collar saying Will You Marry Him in April?
        </p>
        <p>
         She still has the note.
        </p>
        <p>
         Years later, Blattys back feet started to slip out from under him, like his foot pads had lost their grip. We didnt worry, though, because we figured thats what happens to geriatric cats. And he hopped up on the sink for a drink less often. Lovely Bride and I always said that when he stopped sassing the dog  the dog
         <em>
          looooooooves
         </em>
         the cat; the cat
         <em>
          hates
         </em>
         the dog  then it was time for concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Saturday, he parked on the living room sofa and stayed for two dayswithout eating or drinking. Whenhedisappeared Monday morning, I made Lovely look with me behind the boiler, where I always figured he would go. We found him in the basement with legs splayed, as if he went looking for the catbox but his feet gave out. Later I found him  poof  on the basement sofa, as if thats where he wanted to be all along. Not sure how he got up there.
        </p>
        <p>
         My Lovely Bride phoned the vet  when Icouldnt bear to and found out they make house calls for situations like ours. Wedidntwant his last moments to include a harrowing car ride (which he always hated) and barking dogs (hated them, too) and a cold steel table (ditto).
        </p>
        <p>
         When the vet arrived, I had to ask him to park down the block so the kids wouldnt see his VW bug painted up like a dog  complete with 4-foot-tall tail on the trunk  and know what was up. As I prattled on during the procedure, mentioning that Blatty had lived in New Orleans, New York, New Jersey, Washington and Baltimore, the vet tech said he was better traveled than she was.
        </p>
        <p>
         The hardest part was seeing our poor cat suffer at the end  and then seeing his life end in a blink.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other hardest part was telling the kids.
        </p>
        <p>
         We had prepared them by pointing out that Blatty hadnt moved for days because he couldnt walk any more. He hadnt eaten or drunk for days. For a couple of nights, certain he wouldnt make it through, we told them to say their goodbyes and give him and extra squeeze.
        </p>
        <p>
         Carla had the predictably loudest and most immediate reaction, wailing deeply. When can we get a new cat? she asked two minutes later, still sobbing. Eddie crawled in my lap and got teary-eyed and red-faced. Hes the one Im more worried about  hes older and will remember more, especially missing how the cats favorite sleeping place was curled up in bed next to my 8-year-old.Around Carla, who was jealous that the cat preferred to sleep with Eddie, Blatty started hiding after she once tied the him to her bed for the evening. As Carla cried, she lamented all of the mean things she had done to the cat and railed that the cat had never liked her.
        </p>
        <p>
         We tried to think of favorite memories to share. Lovely Bride remembered taking Blatty in the middle of the night on a New York City bus to the kitty emergency room aftera large animalbit a hole in his head, thinking he was done for. Okay, genuine, but not the pick-me-up we were looking for. One time my mother gave us a book about training your cat to talk by using a voice like Minnie Mouse. (It worked  we didnt need an alarm clock for years.) Then there was the videotape for cats, showing birdfeeders and aquariums and getting our cat worked into a complete frenzy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The kids cracked a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then I remembered a bag of Cheetos, forgotten and stashed after a road trip, and the kids sprang off the sofa before I even suggested them as a snack.
        </p>
        <p>
         We kept the kids home from school yesterday for a three-minute funeral, which I cobbled together out of the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer. It always seems to rain at funerals, but it let up just enough to let us have our little service. We went back inside and cranked up Stray Cat Strut to shake the blues away.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then we ate more Cheetos.
        </p>
        <p>
         Goodbye, dear puss.

         I almost would give my left arm if the weather would shift to winter already so Eddie and I could skip our daily battles over wearing shorts to school. If its 45 degrees in the morning, you cant wear shorts. Its freezing. You. Just. Cant.

         It doesnt help at all that the TV forecast last night said it would be 70 today  and that Eddie saw the forecast.
        </p>
        <p>
         This morning, Eddie put on shorts and a t-shirt. I thought having him walk the dog in that, in 40-degree weather, would make him say, Gee, its really cold out! Youre right, Dad. I do need to wear long pants!
        </p>
        <p>
         Way to go, Passive-Aggressive Dad!
        </p>
        <p>
         He comes back inside anddoesntsay a thing. My Lovely Bride chirps, Eddie, your arms are like ice cubes! (Well played, sweetheart, and I didnt even tip her off!)
        </p>
        <p>
         And then begin about five conversations about wearing pants on cold days, consolidated into one big exchange just for you, dear reader.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its 45 degrees out. You need to wear pants this morning, I tell him.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Dad, its going to be 70 this afternoon. The TV forecast said so.
        </p>
        <p>
         No, I checked again this morning. Its only going to be in the 60s. See? Wear pants. Youll be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
         His face starts to get red.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dad, I need to wear shorts today. For the one-mile race. Its
         <em>
          right after
         </em>
         school.
        </p>
        <p>
         No, its not until 4 oclock. Actually the girls go at 4, and the boys at 4:15. You can come home and change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Can I wear shorts under my pants?
        </p>
        <p>
         No. Were not discussing it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tears start to well up.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Dad, Im going to be the
         <em>
          weird kid
         </em>
         on the playground! All the other kids are wearing shorts!
        </p>
        <p>
         I dont care. I care that youre dressed appropriately for cool weather.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Daaa-aaaddd!! Cue the waterworks and wailing voice, cracking with despair.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eddie, whining and crying and lollygagging and disobeying are not the way to get what you want.
        </p>
        <p>
         It reached fever pitch when he dissolved in tears at the breakfast table for this umpteenth episode of Morning Battles With Dad. My Lovely Bride jumped in.
        </p>
        <p>
         Look, she snapped. I have to work late again tonight. And I had to work late last night. And I only get to see you kids for an hour. Id rather it not be filled with barking and whining and tears. NOW QUIT IT!
        </p>
        <p>
         Sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its really not about the weather. Its about the whining and backtalk and following directions.

         , wearing pants versus shorts, whatever. When Dad says to do it, you do it! Really, its about parental authority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Im such a rules guy  except when I think theyre stupid. With Eddie, I just need some sort of guideline, or else well be having this argument when its 20 degrees out.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Daaa-aad, my bottom half never gets cold. Its my top half. Ill wear a jacket.
        </p>
        <p>
         You mean the one you lost at school two days ago? Well, you can wear the one with the broken zipper. But you have to wear pants.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know hes resisting this because  like me with rules and laws I dont want to obey because I think theyre stupid  he thinks this is stupid. But if thats what Dad says, then thats what you have to do! Uh, right?
        </p>
        <p>
         Driving my 8-year-old to tears at the breakfast table was not part of my plan of how to be a good father. I just dont know how to find a reasonable compromise without letting my parental authority completely evaporate. First obey, then well discuss. But if you whine and cry and scream, the discussion is over. This problem is not going to go away. What should I do?
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally its 8:32  past time to get out the door. Eddie runs upstairs to get his Star Wars book to read during free time. The minutes pass. I send Carla out the door to walk with the neighbors we take turns with in the mornings. I run upstairs to find Eddie on the floor in his room, shoes off.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!!!?????
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         I scoop up my 8-year-old and his jacket and his shoes and haul everything down the stairs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had an itch. I needed to scratch it!
        </p>
        <p>
         Alright, but not NOW, Eddie! Your friends are waiting and youre going to make them all late for school!
        </p>
        <p>
         I tell the friends to go ahead, that Ill walk him later.
        </p>
        <p>
         And what are the neighbor kids wearing?
        </p>
        <p>
         Shorts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ugh.
        </p>
        <p>
         What a great way to start the day.

        </p>
        <p>
         She usually travels for work in October and early November and then again in late January and February. This year started early, however, because shes one of six chosen from 400 for a leadership development program held with another university on the West Coast. Factor in travel days plus visits to her prospects in the Northwest, and shes

         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         I dont begrudge her this time at all, because its energizng her in her work, which provides well for our family. And really, it doesnt change my routine one bit. While the kids have been at school this week, Ive kept busy with another freelance article (assigned on Thursday, due on Tuesday  awk!), and weve had workers cutting holes in our attic walls all week installing central air conditioning. (I want to drop the window units out of the third floor window, but it would probably crack the patio.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The hardest part comes after the children go to bed. Then theres nobody else to help with the dishes, the laundry and walking the dog. Theres nobody to talk to. And worst of all, theres nobody else to fold the damn socks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the time difference and the intensity of her class, weve been limited to just a few minutes on the phone when the kids get home from school and shes got a few minutes for lunch. Then when Lovely Bride called last night, I got verbal diarrhea:

         Lovely Bride: What?
        </p>
        <p>
         I try to limit the whining about her absence, especially after I ran into a friend whose husband is in India for two weeks. Turns out she stays up way when her spouse is away, too, because theres nobody to go to bed with at night. And compared with military spouses whose loved ones are gone for months or a year or more, I really have nothing to complain about.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have tried to man up and call in some chits for a little relief. Neighbor pals watched Carla while Eddie had a soccer game Monday and practice Wednesday. And I used some baby bucks from our neighborhood babysitting co-op Tuesday night so I could go to a meeting for our neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a big step for me to actually ask for help instead of just suffering through and dragging my 5-year-old to soccer and then snapping at her to quit acting like a dirt monkey. When Im actually paying attention to what shes doing, that is.
        </p>
        <div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_550" style="width: 235px">

          The National Museum of the American Indian was terrific, but the kids almost liked better throwing rocks into puddles on the National Mall.
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         During our Washington museum trip yesterday, I brought along neighbor pals Caleb and Tina. Theyre the same ages as Eddie and Carla, so its a beautiful matchup. It actually keeps my kids out of my hair better when playmates keep them busy, though the excitement made the 40-mile interstate drive a wee bit hairy at times.
        </p>
        <p>
         My kids were crestfallen when I made them go inside for supper the minute we got home  at the very moment neighbor kid Harris came scootering up the sidewalk. I was honest with Eddie: I didnt want him to go out because I couldnt bear fighting with him when it was time to come in. If he could promise to come in without complaint, then he could go out for half an hour. Ditto Carla, whom I dumped with a mom across the street watching her kids play outside.
        </p>
        <p>
         Okay, they both said.
        </p>
        <p>
         But then when I came to fetch Eddie, he flung his scooter down. I grabbed it and told him I was taking it away for three days because he knows not to throw it.
        </p>
        <p>
         But YOU made me lose the race! he wailed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Huh?
        </p>
        <p>
         I dont care about the race, I told him. I care that you dont break your scooter after I told you not to throw it down like that.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the more you remind me, the more I forget! he cried. Cue the waterworks.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Eddie, I didnt remind you. Time to come in.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lovely Bride reminded me that spitefulness and gotcha arent two of the best parenting tactics in the book. Yes I know, I answered, but I thought we agreed

         Today I chuck my full-time job as at-home dad to share my article in The Baltimore Sun. One editor rejected an August pitch about how parents can survive the waning days of summer without eating their young, but he said a project with bloggers writing about cheap weekends still needed a Mommy blogger.

         A few ideas got cut for lack of space. Others are less timely as the weather cools. But file them away for next summer, because they were

         Nothing suits a warm fall day like a trip to Baltimore Countys
         <strong>
          Double Rock Park
         </strong>
         . Point your GPS to the corner of Texas Avenue and Glen Road in Parkville, and drive to the second play area in the back. In Stemmers Run, the wide stream down a steep slope behind the bathrooms, your kids can chase tiny fish, build dams and drop football-sized rocks into shallow pools. And like my 8-year-old son, try in vain to smash the tiny fish.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, you can marvel at the dense woods and wonder if youre still in Baltimore. Teens might text their pals how lame nature is, but younger kids will probably go for this. Wear shoes you can get wet and swimsuits you dont mind getting dirty. And dont forget the bug spray and a change of clothes.

         near York, Pa., which sells ice cream, baked goods and other dairy items, start your self-guided tour by looking on the wall to find papers with dairy farm facts. Out back in the milking parlor, watch workers attach machines to beachball-sized udders as cows give eight gallons of milk a day. Wait until the red doors open, then step around the storage tanks and stand your kids on milk crates to see.
        </p>
        <p>
         Afternoon milking time starts daily at 3. Then children often like to help bottle-feed a dozen enthusiastic calves at 4 p.m. My kids jumped when they felt the calves tongues, which were muscular, ropy and sandpapery all at once.

        <p>
         Then sit at a picnic table as your kids run off their ice cream crazies in the corn maze for a while.

         Halfway along the parks 1.2-mile loop youll find ample parking, dozens of shaded picnic tables and a long sandy beach. Along this wide stretch of the Gunpowder River, a few miles north of where it joins the Chesapeake Bay, my children spent five hours in and out of the water, building sandcastles and harassing Canadian geese. For $3 a vehicle, theres hardly a better bargain in Baltimore.

         It was hard to get my kids to stop to eat  except the $1 a scoop ice cream at the snack bar, which also serves hot dogs, hamburgers and snoballs. Walking to the nearby watersports area  which rents kayaks and other water gear starting at $15 an hour  I saw the area needs better trash pickup. The best part: my 5-year-old daughter napped on the ride home.

          Does your kid produce this volume of tissues in 2 days?
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         I dont know what it is with my 8-year-old son that renders him unable to blow his nose. To my satisfaction, that is.
        </p>
        <p>
         All I want is for mucus to actually leave his head so I dont have to hear that horrible shnurking sound of someone who cant find a tissue. And of someone whos going to damage his ears. And I want him to blow his nose
         <em>
          more than once
         </em>
         on the tissue and not just ball the thing up after a half-hearted, mucus-free blow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, I know Im stark raving mad to actually care about this. And I pride myself on not
         <a href="2010/02/02/why-are-there-sugar-piles-in-the-dollhouse/index.html">
          hovering over my children
         </a>
         , to mixed results. But if you had to listen to the shnurking as much as I do, and you went through tissues like we do in my house, and your kid left balled up tissues all over creation, youd start to micromanage the nose blowing, too.
        </p>
        <p>
         At first I just pecked and pecked at him.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eddie, blow your nose.
        </p>
        <p>
         No, actually blow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dont just wipe and toss.
        </p>
        <p>
         You have to let your nostrils be open for the mucus to come out. Dont pinch your nose shut the instant you start blowing. Then nothing comes out! Now come here, and Ill help you blow your nose.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eddie: Da-aaaaaddddd!!! Owwww!
        </p>
        <p>
         It got so bad that my Lovely Bride finally blew up  at Eddie
         <em>
          and
         </em>
         at me. Its not like I enjoy it, but no more nagging on the nose-blowing, she said. And no more leaving snotty tissues on the floor, she told him, unless you want Daddy to send you to nose-blowing class. (We threatened a real-live, pay-for-it manners class last month, but it would have ruined the last week of summer.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ive tried being really positive when he does a big snotty blow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yaaaaaay! What a good nose blowing! Doesnt that feel so much better?
        </p>
        <p>
         But it sounds really fake. Then he drops the tissue on the rug and the celebration ends.
        </p>
        <p>
         Try using a trashcan, kiddo.
        </p>
        <p>
         I finally realized that its about obedience and listening. And I know Im just like Eddie  if a rule or law is stupid, then I shouldnt have to follow it. Like going 60 on an interstate or our elementary school principals reminder not to walk dogs to school with your children because they might frighten other kids.
        </p>
        <p>
         I just want him to realize that on little things like this, Ill get out of his hair a lot quicker if he just sucks it up and follows directions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Months ago, we had a
         <a href="2010/11/13/make-your-bed/index.html">
          big bed-making brouhaha
         </a>
         , and I just didnt get it. When I was growing up, if Mom said to make your bed, you made your bed. Why put up a fight? Now I embrace it as a way to straighten up your room, get ready for your day, and, most importantly, not crawl back into bed. So I made Eddie miserable over taking both pillows off, stretching the sheet tight, folding it down at the top, smoothing out the comforter and getting both pillows back off the floor. Eventually, I learned to accept just about anything as a made bed, except when it has a huge lump in the middle. Just get it done.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, now Eddie is old enough to ask why you have to make your bed when youre only going to mess it up again at the end of the day. Sigh. Because I said so, thats why!
        </p>
        <p>
         So with the nose blowing, its kind of the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         You just cant go around shnurffling all the time. And you cant pinch your nose shut as soon as you start to blow because you might as well not blow at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         So if I tell you to blow your nose, then BLOW!
        </p>
        <p>
         Oh, and were having him tested by a pediatric allergist next month. Maybe theres a pill for this.

         Ten years ago, this morning, I passed through the World Trade Center on my way to work. My shift started at 7 a.m., and I changed trains there every day to reach my office in Jersey City. Being in the news business, my coworkers and I got word of the attacks immediately. I phoned my wife at work in Upper Manhattan and told her to turn on the news. Before I knew it, my building was evacuated with the instructions Go West!
        </p>
        <p>
         We didnt have cell phones, so I called my parents in Virginia and she reached hers in Atlanta, and they got word to Lovely and me that we each were okay. Ill never forget how incredibly blue the sky was that day  primary election day and the first day of school. I had left the windows up in our Brooklyn apartment, and I worried I would find our dog and cat covered in ash.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we started dating, people asked when we were getting married. Then at the wedding in 1998, people asked when we were going to have children. In 10 years, we told them, just to shut them up.
        </p>
        <p>
         September 11
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         changed that.
        </p>
        <p>
         What were we waiting for?
        </p>
        <p>
         On September 11, 2002, my Lovely Bride and I had left the country. The pain and memory were too fresh and intense, and we wanted nothing more than to loll about for two weeks in our Happy Place, the
         <a href="2011/01/19/moving-to-france/index.html">
          South of France
         </a>
         . So we did.
        </p>
        <p>
         We had intended the trip as the Conception Tour. I was hoping it would take
         <em>
          a lot
         </em>
         of practice to make a baby
         <em>
          .
         </em>
         We didnt know, however, that my Lovely Bride was pregnant before we left. Eddies first cells were built out of mussels, red wine and coffee. Whoops.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now in 2011, my wife and I were desperate to get out of the house after a week of rain, and I wanted to avoid coverage of 9/11. We found ourselves out for a late afternoon hike at Oregon Ridge Park outside Baltimore, and we noticed a couple of things. There were a number of planes flying eerily low, which happened for weeks after 9/11. We finally have kids old enough to do fun, spontaneous outings with. And hiking was exactly what we were doing in France a year after 9/11. Looking back, we realized she was so tired that day because she was newly pregnant with Eddie!
        </p>
        <p>
         This year, we debated how much to tell the children about September 11. Previously, we shut out nearly all news of it. This year being a big anniversary, however, we decided our 8-year-old could handle most of it. Just no pictures of the people who jumped. Our 5-year-old had been asking questions she could hardly put words to, making me think she doesnt understand much about what was going on. But she can understand that bad people slammed planes into incredibly tall buildings, which made lots of people die when they fell down.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want our children to know about this event that their parents lived through.
        </p>
        <p>
         That changed us. And changed our country and our world. Hurtful history, but family history.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Our
         </em>
         history.
        </p>
        <p>
         This morning, all four of us watched the memorial on TV, and my wife covered their eyes at parts of ABCs rebroadcast of its coverage 10 years ago. I dont think Eddie needs to see a 110-story building being vaporized. Neither do I. Horrible as it was, it was comforting seeing all those surviving family members read the names of those who died. The Brooklyn Youth Choir singing America the Beautiful sent me over the edge, though.
        </p>
        <p>
         Later for church, I couldnt decide if I wanted to wear an I Love New York t-shirt and grab a bullhorn and tell people all about it  or if I wanted just to hide. I took offense 10 years ago when people called it an attack on America. I felt like it was an attack on
         <em>
          my city
         </em>
         . Maybe now because I dont live there anymore, I realize the nations outreach to all New Yorkers was genuine and deserved. When the first church song today was How Great Is Our God, I just lost it. I squeezed Eddie to me and wrapped my arm around my Lovely Bride and reached for Carla.
         <em>
          This
         </em>
         is why Im here. Maybe not to win a Pulitzer, but for this woman. And these children of ours.
        </p>
        <p>
         It irritated me at first that all of Baltimore was thinking today only of football, and the Ravens home opener against rival Pittsburgh. But walking out of church, I welcomed the distraction. I spent the day remembering. I spent the day honoring the living, too, by going on with life. And so did the whole family.

         I told the kids at dinner tonight that I sobbed because I was sad for all the people who died, but also because I realized I have so much to live for. The Twin Towers were really big, and the awful things that happened that day were even bigger, but God is even bigger than all that. And he loves my children and me and Lovely and all the people who died and even the highjackers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whats a highjacker? Carla asked.
        </p>
        <p>
         The people who crashed the planes into those buildings. On purpose, I said.
        </p>
        <p>
         Do you love the highjackers? Eddie asked.
        </p>
        <p>
         No, but I guess I should try. But God does, and thats because hes God, and Im not.

         I really miss New York today.

         Growing up in my house, we were die-hard, unreconstructed thank you note writers. Even if I had just gushingly thanked a blood relative  in person  in his or her home  every year for Christmas and birthdays, we wrote thank you notes ASAP. So, nearly two months later, I thank the good folks at  for running a guest post I wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two months ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         What can I say. Summer ate my brain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before the snarky snarks of Mommyland ran my  post, you could count my daily web traffic on your fingers and toes. A Big Day meant more than 50 hits. Then they ran my post, and my readership went through the roof. For me, that is. The next day, I got 1,599 hits or page views or reads or whatever you call it. Thats more than in the previous year and a half put together.I picked up
         <em>
          17
         </em>
         subscribers. I gotta write for them more often!
        </p>
        <p>
         The solidarity and support was overwhelming. When my 8-year-old had a
         <a href="2011/06/15/wii-rage/index.html">
          Wii meltdown
         </a>
         , you folks told me I handled it well! (Except for the at-home dad and self-described gamer who lives in my neighborhood, who praised his 6-year-olds computer skills and told me I was too harsh. Fair enough.) You expressed thankfulness for your own husbands who stay home with the kiddos. You inspired me to write more. Maybe I
         <em>
          can
         </em>
         turn all this into a book and make a dollar or two.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was as if the internet gave me a big hug.
        </p>
        <p>
         I felt like Ive been discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next day, my blog traffic was about 500 hits, still epic for me. Then about half the day after that and half again the next day. And then school let out, and my workload went way up, and the writing went way down. (People ask if its easier being an at-home parent in the summer. Umm, no. Try breaking up squabbles every 12 minutes and dealing with purposely contradictory children who never want to go to the pool at the same time. Never mind that we actually
         <em>
          have
         </em>
         a
         <a href="2010/06/15/am-i-a-fool-not-to-join-a-pool/index.html">
          pool membership
         </a>
         this year.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The wax and wane reminds me of a story I read in elementary school, . In it, a lab mouse and a low-IQ janitor undergo some experiment that temporarily triples their intelligence. It wears off eventually, and both return to their limited mental state. Rants from Mommyland gave me a big run, but now Im back to being just regular old me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, Mommyland!

          My kiddos never got around to sorting the mail at Storyville, because my stall tactics ran out and we sort of got the boot.
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         The day was all mapped out: with a friends two kids plus my own pair, we would drop my oldest at camp across town then pass the morning at
         <a href="2009/12/07/diaper-bag-dialogue-disperse-you-men/index.html">

         , a clean and well-designed kids play area at a county library branch. When the attendant asked how old one of them was, I knew I was in busted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ummm. Shes a very well-behaved seven, I said, grinning as I tried to flash my SuperDad wiles.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well no kids older than 5 are allowed in, she said, as her face hardened. Its designed to help kids get ready for kindergarten. Older kids would get bored.
        </p>
        <p>
         But theres nobody else in there. What difference does it make? I promise shell be especially well behaved, I said.
        </p>
        <p>
         Really, I wanted the two neighbor kids and my daughter to go play and leave me alone. I had even brought a newspaper to read in anticipation of a milliseconds peace. But Little Miss I-Have-One-Iota-Of-Power-In-This-World-And-Im-Gonna-Use-It-On-You was trying to ruin my whole morning. Ive been schlepping across town all week to take Eddie to Design Your First Video Game camp, and I already had done all the errands I could come up with. Now I was going to have three kids on my hands for three hours, out of the house and too far to go home and back, and with nothing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Are you sure there isnt something we could do? If I had my 8-year-old, I wouldnt even ask, because he would tear the place up. But this 7-year-old is better behaved than my own children
        </p>
        <p>
         Uhhh the rule is the rule, but I guess we could ask my supervisor.
        </p>
        <p>
         I smelled blood in the water. I was going to win!

         Boss-Lady Librarian game the same response, even after I spun my tale of woe and told her how much I had enjoyed
         <a href="www.bcplstoryville.org">
          Storyville
         </a>
         in the past. (This is only partly true, as a group of
         <a href="2009/12/07/diaper-bag-dialogue-disperse-you-men/index.html">
          at-home dads got busted
         </a>
         a while back for excessive socializing.) Its got a pretend store with plastic vegetables, a diggable garden with rubber dirt-mulch, houses with steps to climb up and down and fake logs to crawl through. And books all over the place.
        </p>
        <p>
         How about this? she said. I could take your friend here on a special tour of Storyville while you come in with your younger ones. Then maybe youd like to see our regular childrens section and try our summer reading program craft.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once we went in, Carla and our 7-year-old friends 5-year-old little brother tore around the place like rabid hyenas. Up and down and up and down the steps and hooting and hollering, while I looked around and tried to remember what was so enchanting about the place. Sure, if your kid is 2 or 3, maybe they would go for all the puppets and blocks and stuffed animals of horseshoe crabs and starfish. But the two 5-year-olds ripped through everything in about two minutes before settling into the pretend grocery store, which creepily seemed designed to prepare them not for kindergarten but for a future in minimum-wage retail.
        </p>
        <p>
         Boss-Lady Librarian brought our 7-year-old friend to the pretend store (momentary panic a few minutes earlier  my friends kid was out of view with a complete stranger who only
         <em>
          said
         </em>
         she was a librarian), and all three kids happily played store while I asked complicated questions to try to drag out the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         What made the whole thing come together was that for once I was able to think on my feet and understand the value of the deal. Boss-Lady kept the older kid busy while I sat on my tush watching fewer kids than when I started. Win for me!
        </p>
        <p>
         I no longer wanted to hit the librarian.

         My little nephew is constantly asking why-why-why, but thats because hes 2. Thats what he does. You could give 27 different answers and it makes no difference to him. My 5-year-old daughter, however, asks questions that twist my brain into pretzels  usually while Im driving and cant pay full attention anyway.

         The questions all flow out of things that happen in our world and bubble up later  such as the escalator we rode three days ago at Macys, the GPS stolen from our neighbors car in 2008 or when I broke my arm. In 1983.

         How many nights will we stay at the beach?
        </p>
        <p>
         How do you break your arm?
        </p>
        <p>
         Did a dog bite Roxanne before?

          In the "proposal," Eddie proposes to clean me out.
         </p>

        <p>
         Eddie has been pestering us for months for money for important things like Wii games and Under Armour shirts. Under a freshly inked deal that nets him a hefty raise for house jobs, my Lovely Bride and I get an 8-year-old housekeeper  and a trip to the poorhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its not fair, hes said for months, that his 5-year-old sister gets 25 cents for unloading the silverware out of the dishwasher, while he gets 25 cents for unloading all the plates and cups. (Good point, but Mommy insists equal work merits equal pay. And Carla was too little to handle the breakables.) Weve told him countless times that he needs to make a proposal. How much should we pay him and for which jobs? Lovely Bride can still remember her father making her write a budget, where she proposed spending on candy, church giving, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well guess who learned excel at school this year?

          (Thanks, Mrs. Clark!)
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         And the child included hyperlinks to a text document. And a bar graph. And snazzy arrows that I dont even know how to put in. So today, on the last day of second grade, we signed his proposal, aptly titled, proposal, which sets out a price list of 16 house jobs and a weekly pay schedule.

          Eddie proposes spending his dough on important things, such as Wii games and Under Armour shirts. At least it's not for new wheels and cologne.

        <p>
         If he does all the jobs once in a week, hell get almost $10.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hey, I want a raise, too.
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe that some jobs a kid just has to do. In our house, you dont get paid for setting the table or brushing your teeth. And if you dont pick up your room, Ill put your stuff in

          I like a housekeeper who charges only 50 cents to vacuum a room, but the quality needs a little improvement.
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         When my dad told me to collect the trash, I had to collect the trash. I did get an allowance  maybe $5 a week in high school?  without having to do much of anything. I think I got paid for cutting the grass, but it took an hour on our huge riding mower. I just dont recall wanting to buy much of anything, except tickets to the movie theater 20 miles away.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eddie wanted
         <em>
          two bucks
         </em>
         for walking the dog around the block, and we rejected that. Maybe Im spoiled with having him occasionally walk her for free  but almost always under duress, with loud grumbling. For mopping the kitchen floor, we actually upped the pay from 75 cents to a full dollar  this task requires training and some attention to detail. Maybe this will motivate him to help out more. But something tells me that hell eventually choose to ride his bike and not wash windows. Instead of vacuuming, hell read a book. And because the new pay-for-work list is optional, I worry that this gives him permission to stop contributing around the house.
        </p>
        <p>
         And then theres the question of quality control. After todays half-day of school and celebratory ice cream, he chose to wash the windows instead of play for half an hour before going to visit Mommy at her office. I never do windows, so I cant complain about Eddies doing 11 windows and seven rooms, even if they do end up a little smurchy.
        </p>

         I can easily suck the joy out of things, so this time Ill try not to. See this here
