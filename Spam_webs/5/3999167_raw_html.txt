         WorldAccelerator.com has compiled the top 20 domain sales since 2000. It is important to note that this data is compiled from a variety of public sources only. Therefore the numbers do not include private sales that happen between parties and are not disclosed. Private sales are often high price sales between high profile parties where the parties prefer to have the transaction price not disclosed. The names below are names where we attribute the bulk of the sale price to the domain name.

        Privacy Policy
       </h2>
       <p>
        Our policy governs the collection of personal and business
				information through the WorldAccelerator.com website and program
				(the "Website"), mobile applications, and/or our platform and
				services (collectively the "World Accelerator Program"). This policy
				describes the types of information we may collect from visitors and
				how that information is used. Please read this policy carefully
				before providing us with any information. If you have questions
				about this policy, please contact us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy was last updated as of the date below and this
				represents the current policy in effect and governing all personal
				information collected both before and after this date (see below
				section Changes to this Privacy Policy).
       </p>
       <h3>
        INFORMATION WE COLLECT
       </h3>
       <p>
        Applicants interested in applying must agree to our Application
				Rules before submitting their ideas which state that teams that
				submit a business idea understand that ideas submitted are not
				confidential and may be published by World Accelerator for visitors
				to vote on and comment. Multiple people may have the same idea and
				ideas may be thought of or implemented by someone else. World
				Accelerator is looking for ideas and the best teams to implement
				them. While we are requesting your ideas and why you are the right
				team to implement them, we request that information that you deem as
				proprietary should not be submitted.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Unregistered users
       </h4>
       <p>
        If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is
				limited. We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems
				with our services and track usage statistics. Your IP address may
				vary each time you visit, or it may be the same. We may log other
				non-personal information such as the type of internet browser that
				you use or your connection speed. It would be extremely difficult
				for us to identify you through your IP address, browser type, or
				other non-personal information that we collect and we make no
				attempt to do so. If you reach us by clicking on a link or
				advertisement on another website, we may log that information.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We may place a small "cookie" file on your computer's hard
				drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your
				path through our Website and to determine whether you have visited
				us before. You may elect not to accept cookies by changing settings
				in your browser; however, by not accepting cookies some or all of
				the functions of the Website may not work for you. Unless you
				register with us, the cookie contains no personally identifiable
				information. We may use cookies to help us understand how visitors
				use our Website and to help us to improve. We also compile this
				information and use it in the aggregate to determine common themes
				and trends among our visitors. From time to time our Website also
				may run usability testing to help us improve the functions of our
				Website for all users. This may include recording random tests that
				track users' actions and movements on specific pages of our Website.
				Our tests are contained to our Website and we do not track users'
				behavior on other websites.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Registered users
       </h4>
       <p>
        Registered Users are users that sign up at our Website. You can
				register to take advantage of personalization features as well as
				enhanced services that we offer. If you choose to register with us,
				in addition to information that we collect above we may collect
				personal information including, but not limited to names,
				birthdates, relationships, addresses, email addresses, user names
				and passwords and other contact information. Also you will be able
				to add text, comments, files, images, audio, video or other personal
				materials (collectively "Content") to certain areas of our Website
				and to participate with more of our site features. The information
				we collect may vary, but we only collect the information that you
				manually supply to us or otherwise authorize us to collect. We may
				store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard
				drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit. In
				that way, we can save your preferences between visits and present
				you with a customized experience each time you visit. If you reach
				our Website through one of our partners and you choose to register
				with us, we may be required to give our partner your registration
				information.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Billing Information
       </h4>
       <p>
        Financial information including credit card and bank account
				information, and other such billing information are passed directly
				to the stated payment processor and are not stored on our servers
				unless you authorize such storage.
       </p>
       <h3>
        HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
       </h3>
       <p>
        We use personal information to provide you with a custom and
				personal experience at our Website. Registering also allows you to
				log in to our Website to personalize your experience and gain access
				to information you may have stored during previous use of our
				Website. We may use your personal information to periodically
				contact you with news or important information, to provide you with
				other information or invitations related to our Wesite, and to
				request your feedback. In addition to these periodic updates, we may
				email you additional marketing materials that you have requested or
				that we believe would be of interest to you based upon information
				you've provided. These marketing materials might include opt-in
				newsletters and partner offers. You may opt-out of any or all
				marketing communications in any commercial e-mail we send or at any
				time (opt-out links are provided in all marketing-related emails and
				any fax or mail correspondence we send you will also include opt-out
				instructions). You may not opt-out of service messages or standard
				service newsletters or announcements; however, if you wish to not
				receive such communications you may cancel your account.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We may also use certain information that you provide in order to
				present you with advertising and offers that you may find
				interesting. This benefits both of us. It benefits us because
				advertising helps pay the bills, and we can charge our advertisers
				more if they know that their ads will be seen by somebody more
				likely to find it useful. It benefits you because you see
				advertising that is more likely to be interesting to you and because
				it permits us to offer you a broader range of free services.
       </p>
       <h3>
        DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
       </h3>
       <p>
        We may share some of your personal information with third-parties
				engaged in providing services to us where the sharing of information
				is necessary to provide our services. We also may share your
				information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a
				divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, and in the
				unlikely event of bankruptcy. We require all such parties to agree
				to privacy requirements at least as stringent as our privacy
				requirements, to use any such personal data solely for the purpose
				of providing the specified services to us, and to comply with
				applicable laws.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We may also share personal information
				that is de-identified and compiled in aggregated summaries with
				third parties who may utilize such information for purposes,
				including but not limited to, data analysis and analytics purposes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some
				circumstances be required to disclose personally identifiable
				information in response to requests from law enforcement
				authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We
				can turn over information about you if we believe we must in order
				to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this policy, you
				consent to our doing so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to
				our disclosing information about you in the course of legal
				proceedings if we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably
				believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so
				will assist us in enforcing our legal rights.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Except in the specific situations described HEREIN, we will not
				disclose, share, rent, or sell the personal information you provide
				to us with any third party.
       </h4>
       <p>
        Applicants interested in applying must agree to our Application
				Rules before submitting their ideas which state that teams that
				submit a business idea understand that ideas submitted are not
				confidential and may be published by World Accelerator for visitors
				to vote on and comment. Multiple people may have the same idea and
				ideas may be thought of or implemented by someone else. World
				Accelerator is looking for ideas and the best teams to implement
				them. While we are requesting your ideas and why you are the right
				team to implement them, we request that information that you deem as
				proprietary should not be submitted.
       </p>
       <h3>
        SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
       </h3>
       <p>
        We use commercially reasonable efforts to implement all generally
				accepted, industry-standard best practices for the protection of
				personal information. However, no website or platform is entirely
				secure, and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will
				not be intercepted or accessed by others. While we have taken
				commercially reasonable precautions to protect the personal
				information that you provide to us, you should exercise discretion
				in what you provide to us, as there is always a risk that our
				Website or platform may be compromised via a malicious attack, a
				system failure, a human error, or another vulnerability, which could
				result in the disclosure of personal information to third parties.
				Any third parties that we share personal information with will be
				solely responsible for securing any personal information that they
				receive from us. All such personal information will be protected in
				accordance with such third parties' security practices and
				procedures then in-effect.
       </p>
       <h3>
        CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
       </h3>
       <p>
        We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it
				advisable to do so. We will always post the latest date indicating
				the most current policy in effect. Any update will automatically
				apply so we encourage you to review. If we make material changes
				that will affect personal information we have already collected from
				you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes
				and give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.
				We take your privacy seriously; please don't hesitate to contact us
				with any questions or concerns you may have.
