      According to
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol14.html#VERDICT">
       a 
Memphis jurys verdict on December 8, 1999
      </a>
      , in
the wrongful death lawsuit of the King family versus Loyd
Jowers and other unknown co-conspirators, Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was assassinated by a conspiracy that included
agencies of his own government. Almost 32 years after Kings
murder at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis on April 4, 1968, a
court extended the circle of responsibility for the
assassination beyond the late scapegoat James Earl Ray to the
United States government.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      I can hardly believe the fact that, apart from the
courtroom participants, only Memphis TV reporter Wendell Stacy
and I attended from beginning to end this historic
three-and-one-half week trial. Because of journalistic neglect
scarcely anyone else in this land of ours even knows what went
on in it. After critical testimony was given in the trials
second week before an almost empty gallery, Barbara Reis, U.S.
correspondent for the Lisbon daily
      <i>
       Publico
      </i>
      who was there
several days, turned to me and said, "Everything in the U.S. is
the trial of the century. O.J. Simpsons trial was the trial of
the century. Clintons trial was the trial of the century. But
this
      <i>
       is
      </i>
      the trial of the century, and whos here?"
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      What I experienced in that courtroom ranged from
inspiration at the courage of the Kings, their
lawyer-investigator William F. Pepper, and the witnesses, to
amazement at the governments carefully interwoven plot to kill
Dr. King. The seriousness with which U.S. intelligence agencies
planned the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. speaks eloquently
of the threat Kingian nonviolence represented to the powers
that be in the spring of 1968.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      In the complaint filed by the King family, King versus
Jowers and Other Unknown Co-Conspirators, the only named
defendant, Loyd Jowers, was never their primary concern. As
soon became evident in court, the real defendants were the
anonymous co-conspirators who stood in the shadows behind
Jowers, the former owner of a Memphis bar and grill. The Kings
and Pepper were in effect charging U.S. intelligence agencies
 particularly the FBI and Army intelligence  with
organizing, subcontracting, and covering up the assassination.
Such a charge guarantees almost insuperable obstacles to its
being argued in a court within the United States. Judicially it
is an unwelcome beast.

      Many qualifiers have been attached to the verdict in the
King case. It came not in criminal court but in civil court,
where the standards of evidence are much lower than in criminal
court. (For example, the plaintiffs used unsworn testimony made
on audiotapes and videotapes.) Furthermore, the King family as
plaintiffs and Jowers as defendant agreed ahead of time on much
of the evidence.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      But these observations are not entirely to the point.
Because of the governments sovereign immunity, it is not
possible to put a U.S. intelligence agency in the dock of a
U.S. criminal court. Such a step would require authorization by
the federal government, which is not likely to indict itself.
Thanks to the conjunction of a civil court, an independent
judge with a sense of history, and a courageous family and
lawyer, a spiritual breakthrough to an unspeakable truth
occurred in Memphis. It allowed at least a few people (and
hopefully many more through them) to see the forces behind
Kings martyrdom and to feel the responsibility we all share
for it through our government. In the end, twelve jurors, six
black and six white, said to everyone willing to hear: guilty
as charged.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      We can also thank the unlikely figure of Loyd Jowers for
providing a way into that truth.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      Loyd Jowers: When the frail, 73-year-old Jowers became ill
after three days in court, Judge Swearengen excused him. Jowers
did not testify and said through his attorney, Lewis Garrison,
that he would plead the Fifth Amendment if subpoenaed. His
discretion was too late. In 1993 against the advice of
Garrison, Jowers had gone public. Prompted by William Peppers
progress as James Earl Rays attorney in uncovering Jowerss
role in the assassination, Jowers told his story to Sam
Donaldson on
      <i>
       Prime Time Live
      </i>
      . He said he had been asked
to help in the murder of King and was told there would be a
decoy (Ray) in the plot. He was also told that the police
wouldnt be there that night.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      In that interview, the transcript of which was read to the
jury in the Memphis courtroom, Jowers said the man who asked
him to help in the murder was a Mafia-connected produce dealer
named Frank Liberto. Liberto, now deceased,
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol10.html#p1382">
       had a courier
deliver $100,000 for Jowers to hold at his restaurant
      </a>
      , Jims
Grill, the back door of which opened onto the dense bushes
across from the Lorraine Motel. Jowers said he was visited the
day before the murder by a man named Raul, who brought a rifle
in a box.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      As Mike Vinson reported in the March-April
      <i>
       Probe
      </i>
      ,
other witnesses testified to their knowledge of Libertos
involvement in Kings slaying. Store-owner John McFerren said
he arrived around 5:15 pm, April 4, 1968, for a produce pick-up
at Frank Libertos warehouse in Memphis. (King would be shot at
6:0l pm.) When he approached the warehouse office,
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol02.html#p146">
       McFerren
overheard Liberto on the phone inside saying, Shoot the
son-of-a-bitch on the balcony.
      </a>
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      Caf-owner Lavada Addison, a friend of Libertos in the late
1970s,
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol12.html#IhadMLKkilled">
       testified 
that Liberto had told her he had Martin Luther King 
killed.
      </a>
      Addisons son, Nathan Whitlock, said when
he learned of this conversation he asked Liberto point-blank if
he had killed King.
     </p>
     <blockquote class="indentquote">

      I said, What about that other son-of-a-bitch taking

troublemaker from Missouri. He was a front man . . . a setup

     <p class="RHRnormal">
      The jury also
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#TAPEtoJURY">
       heard 
a tape recording of a two-hour-long confession Jowers made at 
a fall 1998 meeting with Martin Luther Kings son Dexter and 
former UN Ambassador Andrew Young
      </a>
      .
On the tape Jowers says that meetings to plan the assassination
occurred at Jims Grill. He said
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p551">
       planners 
included undercover Memphis Police Department officer Marrell McCollough
      </a>
      (who now works for the Central Intelligence Agency, and who is
referenced in the trial transcript as Merrell McCullough), MPD
Lieutentant Earl Clark (who died in 1987), a third police
officer, and two men Jowers did not know but thought were
federal agents.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      Young, who witnessed the assassination, can be heard on the
tape identifying McCollough as the man kneeling beside Kings
body on the balcony in a famous photograph.  According to
witness
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol02.html#CS">
       Cobey
 Vernon Smith
      </a>
      , McCollough
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol02.html#p97">
       had 
infiltrated a Memphis community organizing group, the Invaders
      </a>
      , which was
working with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In
his trial testimony Young said the MPD intelligence agent was
the guy who ran up [the balcony stairs] with us to see
Martin.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      Jowers says on the tape that right after the shot was fired
      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p601">
       he 
received a smoking rifle at the rear door of Jims Grill
from Clark
      </a>
      . He broke the rifle down into two pieces and wrapped
it in a tablecloth. Raul picked it up the next day. Jowers said
he didnt actually see who fired the shot that killed King, but
thought it was Clark, the MPDs best marksman.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="RHRnormal">
      Young testified that his impression from the 1998 meeting
was that the aging, ailing Jowers 

      <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol04.html#p520">
       wanted 
to get right with God
before he died, wanted to confess it and be free of it
      </a>
      . Jowers
denied, however, that he knew the plots purpose was to kill
King  a claim that seemed implausible to Dexter King and
Young. Jowers has continued to fear jail, and he had directed
Garrison to defend him on the grounds that he didnt know the
target of the plot was King. But his interview with Donaldson
suggests he was not nave on this point.

        In the March-April
        <i>

similar removal of
        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol03.html#ER">
         Ed 
Redditt
        </a>
        , a black Memphis Police Department detective, from his 
Fire Station 2 surveillance post two hours before Kings murder.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        To understand the Redditt incident, it is important to note
that it was Redditt himself who initiated his watch on Dr. King
from the firehouse across the street. Redditt testified that
when Kings party and the police accompanying them (including
Detective Redditt) arrived from the airport at the Lorraine
Motel
        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol03.html#p298">
         on 
April 3, he noticed something that was unusual.
        </a>
        When
Inspector Don Smith, who was in charge of security, told
Redditt he could leave, Redditt noticed there was nobody else
there. In the past when we were assigned to Dr. King [when
Redditt had been part of a black security team for King], we
stayed with him. I saw nobody with him. So I went across the
street and asked the Fire Department could we come in and
observe from the rear, which we did. Given Redditts concerns
for Kings safety, his particular watch on the Lorraine may not
have fit into others plans.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        Redditt testified that
        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol03.html#p301">
         late 
in the afternoon of April 4, MPD Intelligence Officer Eli Arkin came to 
Fire Station 2 to take him to Central Headquarters
        </a>
        . There Police and Fire
Director Frank Holloman (formerly an FBI agent for 25 years,
seven of them as supervisor of J. Edgar Hoovers office)
ordered Redditt home, against his wishes and accompanied by
Arkin. The reason Holloman gave Redditt for his removal from
the King watch Redditt had initiated the day before was that
his life had been threatened.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        In an interview after the trial, Redditt told me the story
of how his 1978 testimony on this question before the House
Select Committee on Assassinations was part of a heavily
pressured cover-up. It was a farce, he said, a total farce.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        Redditt had been subpoenaed by the HSCA to testify, as he
came to realize, not so much on his strange removal from Fire
Station 2 as the fact that he had spoken about it openly to
writers and researchers. The HSCA focused narrowly on the
discrepancy between Redditts surveiling King (as he was doing)
and acting as security (an impression Redditt had given writers
interviewing him) in order to discredit the story of his
removal. Redditt was first grilled by the committee for eight
straight hours in a closed executive session. After a day of
hostile questioning, Redditt finally said late in the
afternoon, I came here as a friend of the investigation, not
as an enemy of the investigation. You dont want to deal with
the truth. He told the committee angrily that if the secret
purpose behind the King conspiracy was, like the JFK
conspiracy, to protect the country, just tell the American
people! Theyll be happy! And quit fooling the folks and trying
to pull the wool over their eyes.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        When the closed hearing was over, Redditt received a
warning call from a friend in the White House who said, Man,
your life isnt worth a wooden nickel.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        Redditt said his public testimony the next day was a
set-up: The bottom line on that one was that Senator Baker
decided that I wouldnt go into this open hearing without an
attorney. When the lawyer and I arrived at the hearing, we were
ushered right back out across town to the executive director in
charge of the investigation. [We] looked through a book, to
look at the questions and answers.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        So in essence what they were saying was: This is what
youre going to answer to, and this is how youre going to
answer. It was all made up  all designed, questions and
answers, what to say and what not to say. A total farce.

        followed Redditt to the

Memphis (the unit Redditt had served on earlier). Williams took
pride in providing the best possible protection for Dr. King,

King, as instructed, from an inner court room behind the motel

exposed to public view.

wrote in his book that Kyles emphatically denied making any

         Olivia 
Catling
        </a>
        lived a block away from the Lorraine on
Mulberry Street. Catling had planned to walk down the street
the evening of April 4 in the hope of catching a glimpse of
King at the motel. She testified that when she heard the shot a
little after six oclock, she said, 

        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol04.html#p457">
         Oh, 
my God, Dr. King is at that hotel!

         She
saw a man in a checkered shirt come running out of the alley
beside a building across from the Lorraine
        </a>
        . The man jumped into
a green 1965 Chevrolet just as a police car drove up behind
him. He gunned the Chevrolet around the corner and up Mulberry
past Catlings house moving her to exclaim,

        The police, she told me, asked not one neighbor [around
the Lorraine], What did you see? Thirty-one years went by.
Nobody came and asked one question. I often thought about that.

anything. How did they let him get away?

Joe Brown

         , who had presided over two years of

         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p746">
          67% 
of the bullets from my tests did not match the Ray rifle

          the 
unfired bullets found wrapped with it in a blanket were
metallurgically different from the bullet taken from Kings
body

And because the rifles scope had not been sited, Brown said,

          Arthur 
Hanes Jr
         </a>
         . of Birmingham, Alabama, 
had been Rays attorney in 1968. (On the eve of his
trial, Ray replaced Hanes and his father, Arthur Hanes Sr., by
Percy Foreman, a decision
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p648">
          Ray 
told the Haneses one week later was the biggest mistake of his life
         </a>
         .) 
Hanes testified that in
the summer of 1968 he interviewed Guy Canipe, owner of the
Canipe Amusement Company. Canipe was a witness to the dropping
in his doorway of a bundle that held a trove of James Earl Ray
memorabilia, including the rifle, unfired bullets, and a radio
with Rays prison identification number on it.  This dropped
bundle, heaven (or otherwise) sent for the States case against
Ray, can be accepted as credible evidence through a willing
suspension of disbelief. As Judge Hanes summarized the States
lone-assassin theory (with reference to an exhibit depicting
the scene), James Earl Ray had fired the shot from the
bathroom on that second floor, come down that hallway into his
room and carefully packed that box, tied it up, then had
proceeded across the walkway the length of the building to the
back where that stair from that door came up, had come down the
stairs out the door,
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p654">
          placed 
the Browning box containing the rifle and the radio there in the Canipe 
entryway
         </a>
         . Then Ray
presumably got in his car seconds before the polices arrival,
driving from downtown Memphis to Atlanta unchallenged in his
white Mustang.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Concerning his interview with the witness who was the
cornerstone of this theory, Judge Hanes told the jury that Guy
Canipe (now deceased) provided terrific evidence:  He said
that the package was dropped in his doorway by a man headed
south down Main Street on foot,
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p657">
          and 
that this happened
          <i>
           at about ten minutes before
          </i>
          the shot was fired
         </a>
         [emphasis added].
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Hanes thought Canipes witnessing the bundle-dropping ten
minutes before the shot was very credible for another reason.
It so happened (as confirmed by Philip Melansons research)
that at 6:00 p.m. one of the MPD tactical units that had been
withdrawn earlier by Inspector Evans, TACT 10, had returned
briefly to the area with its 16 officers for a rest break at
Fire Station 2. Thus, as Hanes testified, with the firehouse
brimming with police, some already watching King across the street, 
when they saw Dr. King go down,
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol05.html#p658">
          the 
fire house erupted like a beehive . . . In 
addition to the time involved
         </a>
         [in Rays
presumed odyssey from the bathroom to the car], it was
circumstantially almost impossible to believe that somebody had
been able to throw that [rifle] down and leaave right in the
face of that erupting fire station.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         When I spoke with Judge Hanes after the trial about the
startling evidence he had received from Canipe, he commented,
Thats what Ive been saying for 30 years.

         testified not about the rifle thrown
down in the Canipe doorway but rather the smoking rifle Loyd
Jowers said he received at his back door from Earl Clark right
after the shooting. Hamblin recounted a story he was told many
times by his friend James McCraw, who had died.

         <br/>
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol03.html#JMC">
          James 
McCraw
         </a>
         is already well-known to researchers as the
taxi driver who arrived at the rooming house to pick up Charlie
Stephens shortly before 6:00 p.m. on April 4. In a deposition
read earlier to the jury, McCraw said he found Stephens in his
room lying on his bed too drunk to get up, so McCraw turned out
the light and left without him  minutes before Stephens,
according to the State, identified Ray in profile passing down
the hall from the bathroom. McCraw also
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol03.html#p276">
          said 
the bathroom door next to Stephens room was standing wide open, and 
there was no one in the bathroom
         </a>
          where again, according 
to the State, Ray was then balancing on the tub, about to squeeze the trigger.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         William Hamblin told the jury that he and fellow cab-driver
McCraw were close friends for about 25 years. Hamblin said he
probably
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol08.html#p1003">
          heard 
McCraw tell the same rifle story 50 times
         </a>
         , but only when 
McCraw had been drinking and had his defenses down.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In that story, McCraw said that Loyd Jowers had given him
the rifle right after the shooting. According to Hamblin,
Jowers told him to get the [rifle] and get it out of here now.
[McCraw] said that he grabbed his beer and snatched it out. He
had the rifle rolled up in an oil cloth, and he leapt out the
door and did away with it.
         <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol08.html#p1005">
          McCraw 
told Hamblin he threw the rifle off a bridge into the Mississippi River
         </a>
         .
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Hamblin said McCraw never revealed publicly what he knew of
the rifle because, like Jowers, he was afraid of being
indicted: He really wanted to come out with it, but he was
involved in it. And he couldnt really tell the truth.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         William Pepper accepted Hamblins testimony about McCraws
disposal of the rifle over Jowerss claim to Dexter King that
he gave the rifle to Raul. Pepper said in his closing argument
that the actual murder weapon had been lying

that she had spoken in Portuguese to a woman in Rauls family

they had visited them. Who? Reis asked.

is outside this jurisdiction, so a subpoena would be futile.  But 
he was asked to appear here. In earlier proceedings there
were attempts to depose him, and he resisted them. So he has
not attempted to come forward at all and tell his side of the
story or to defend himself.

         Walter 
Fauntroy
        </a>
        , Dr. Kings colleague and a
20-year member of Congress, chaired the subcommittee of the
1976-78 House Select Committee on Assassinations that
investigated Kings assassination. Fauntroy testified in
Memphis that in the course of the HSCA investigation 

        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol08.html#p1137">
         it was
apparent that we were dealing with very sophisticated forces
        </a>
        .
He discovered electronic bugs on his phone and TV set. When
Richard Sprague, HSCAs first chief investigator, said he would
make available all CIA, FBI, and military intelligence records,
        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol08.html#p1127">
         he 
became a focus of controversy
        </a>
        . Sprague was forced to resign.
His successor made no demands on U.S. intelligence agencies.
Such pressures contributed to the subcommittees ending its
investigation, as Fauntroy said, 

        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol08.html#p1129">
         without 
having thoroughly investigated all of the evidence that was 
apparent
        </a>
        . Its formal conclusion was that Ray 
assassinated King, that he probably had help, and that 
the government was not involved.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        When I interviewed Fauntroy in a van on his way back to the
Memphis Airport, I asked about the implications of his
statements in an April 4, 1997
        <i>
         Atlanta Constitution
        </i>
        article. The article said Fauntroy now believed Ray did not
fire the shot that killed King and was part of a larger
conspiracy that possibly involved federal law enforcement
agencies, and added: Fauntroy said he kept silent about his
suspicions because of fear for himself and his family.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        Fauntroy told me that when he left Congress in 1991 he had
the opportunity to read through his files on the King
assassination, including raw materials that hed never seen
before. Among them was information from J. Edgar Hoovers logs.
There he learned that in the three weeks before Kings murder
the FBI chief held a series of meetings with persons involved
with the CIA and military intelligence in the Phoenix operation
in Southeast Asia. Why? Fauntroy also discovered there had
been Green Berets and military intelligence agents in Memphis
when King was killed. What were they doing there? he asked.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        When Fauntroy had talked about his decision to write a book
about what hed uncovered since the assassination committee
closed down, he was promptly investigated and charged by the
Justice Department with having violated his financial reports
as a member of Congress. His lawyer told him that he could not
understand why the Justice Department would bring up a charge
on the technicality of one misdated check.  Fauntroy said he
interpreted the Justice Departments action to mean: Look,
well get you on something if you continue this way. . . . I
just thought: Ill tell them I wont go and finish the book,
because its surely not worth it.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p class="RHRnormal">
        At the conclusion of his trial testimony, Fauntroy also
spoke about his fear of an FBI attempt to kill James Earl Ray
        <a href="http://ratical.org/ratville/JFK/MLKACT/MLKACTvol08.html#p1153">
         when 
he escaped from Tennessees Brushy Mountain State
Penitentiary in June 1977
        </a>
        . Congressman Fauntroy had heard
reports about an FBI SWAT team having been sent into the area
around the prison to shoot Ray and prevent his testifying at
the HSCA hearings. Fauntroy asked HSCA chair Louis Stokes to
alert Tennesssee Governor Ray Blanton to the danger to the
HSCAs star witness and Blantons most famous prisoner. When
Stokes did, Blanton called off the FBI SWAT team, Ray was
caught safely by local authorities, and in Fauntroys words,
we all breathed a sigh of relief.

       <p class="RHRnormal">
        The Memphis jury also learned how a 1993-98 Tennessee State
investigation into the King assassination was, if not a
cover-up, then an inquiry noteworthy for its lack of witnesses.

mark: He got two out of the first ten (if one counts Charles

        Pepper went a step beyond saying government agencies were
responsible for the assassination. To whom in turn were those
murderous agencies responsible? Not so much to government
officials per se, Pepper asserted, as to the economic
powerholders they represented who stood in the even deeper
shadows behind the FBI, Army Intelligence, and their affiliates
in covert action. By 1968, Pepper told the jury, And today it
is much worse in my view  the decision-making processes in
the United States were the representatives, the footsoldiers of
the very economic interests that were going to suffer as a
result of these times of changes [being activated by King].
        <br/>
        To
say that U.S. government agencies killed Martin Luther
King on the verge of the Poor Peoples Campaign is a way into
the deeper truth that the economic powers that be (which
dictate the policies of those agencies) killed him. In the
Memphis prelude to the Washington campaign, King posed a threat
to those powers of a non-violent revolutionary force. Just how
determined they were to stop him before he reached Washington
was revealed in the trial by the size and complexity of the
plot to kill him.

What Peppers work has accomplished in
print and in court can be measured by the intensity of the
media attacks on him, shades of Jim Garrison. But even Garrison
did not gain the support of the Kennedy family (in his case) or
achieve a guilty verdict. The Memphis trial has opened wide a
door to our assassination politics. Anyone who walks through it
is faced by an either/or: to declare naked either the empire or
oneself.

      The King family has chosen the former. The vision behind
the trial is at least as much theirs as it is William Peppers,

      In his closing argument, William Pepper identified economic
power as the root reason for Kings assassination:

       When 
Martin King opposed the war, when he rallied people to oppose the war,
he was threatening the bottom lines of some of the largest
defense contractors in this country
      </a>
      . This was about money. 
 He was threatening the weapons industry, the hardware, the
armaments industries, that would all lose as a result of the
end of the war.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The second aspect of his work that also dealt with money
that caused a great deal of consternation in the circles of
power in this land had to do with his commitment to take a
massive group of people to Washington. . . . Now he began to
talk about a redistribution of wealth, in this the wealthiest
country in the world.

      Pepper went a step beyond saying government agencies were
responsible for the assassination. To whom in turn were those
murderous agencies responsible? Not so much to government
officials per se, Pepper asserted, as to the economic
powerholders they represented who stood in the even deeper
shadows behind the FBI, Army Intelligence, and their affiliates
in covert action. By 1968, Pepper told the jury, And today it
is much worse in my view

decision-making processes in the United States were the representatives,

      To say that U.S. government agencies killed Martin Luther
King on the verge of the Poor Peoples Campaign is a way into
the deeper truth that the economic powers that be (which
dictate the policies of those agencies) killed him. In the
Memphis prelude to the Washington campaign, King posed a threat
to those powers of a non-violent revolutionary force. Just how
determined they were to stop him before he reached Washington
was revealed in the trial by the size and complexity of the
plot to kill him.

       We 
are talking about a political assassination in modern-day 
times, a domestic political assassination

      . Of
course, it is ironic, but I was watching a special on the CIA.
They say, Yes, weve participated in assassinations abroad
but, no, we could never do anything like that domestically.
Well, I dont know. . . . Whether you call it CIA or some other
innocuous acronym or agency, killing is killing.

      The issue becomes: What do we do about this? Do we endorse
a policy in this country, in this life, that says if we dont
agree with someone, the only means to deal with it is through
elimination and termination? I think my father taught us the
opposite, that you can overcome without violence.

      The jury returned with a verdict after two and

days before retirement, read the verdict aloud. The courtroom
was now crowded with spectators, almost all black.

      In answer to the question, Did Loyd Jowers participate in
a conspiracy to do harm to Dr. Martin Luther King? your answer
is Yes. The man on my left leaned forward and whispered
softly, Thank you, Jesus.

      The judge continued: Do you also find that others,

one is also Yes. An even more heartfelt whisper: Thank you,
Jesus!

        Perhaps the lesson of the King assassination is that our
government understands the power of nonviolence better than we
do, or better than we want to. In the spring of 1968, when
Martin King was marching (and Robert Kennedy was campaigning),
King was determined that massive, nonviolent civil disobedience
would end the domination of democracy by corporate and military
power. The powers that be took Martin Luther King seriously.
They dealt with him in Memphis.
        <br/>
        Thirty-two
years after Memphis, we know that the government
that now honors Dr. King with a national holiday also killed
him. As will once again become evident when the Justice
Department releases the findings of its limited
re-investigation into Kings death, the government (as a
footsoldier of corporate power) is continuing its cover-up 
just as it continues to do in the closely related murders of
John and Robert Kennedy and Malcolm X.

      David Morphy, the only juror to grant an interview, said
later: We can look back on it and say that we did change
history. But thats not why we did it. It was because there was
an overwhelming amount of evidence and just too many odd

      Everything from the police department being pulled back,
to the death threat on Redditt, to the two black firefighters
being pulled off, to the military people going up on top of the
fire station, even to them going back to that point and cutting
down the trees. Who in their right mind would go and destroy a
crime scene like that the morning after? It was just very, very
odd.

      The faithful in a nonviolent movement that hopes to change
the distribution of wealth and power in the U.S.A.  as Dr.
Kings vision, if made real, would have done in 1968  should
be willing to receive the same kind of reward that King did in
Memphis.  As each of our religious traditions has affirmed from
the beginning, that recurring story of martyrdom (witness) is
one of ultimate transformation and cosmic good news.
