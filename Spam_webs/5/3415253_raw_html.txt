          1. If you think you might be fat, you are. Don't ask us. Just get your fat ass in a gym.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          2. Learn to work the toilet seat: if it's up put it down.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          3. Don't cut your hair. Ever.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          4. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if he can find the perfect present, again!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          5. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          6. Sometimes, he's not thinking about you. Live with it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          7. Don't ask him what he's thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation and monster trucks.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          8. Get rid of your cat. And no, it's not different, it's just like every other cat.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          9. Dogs are better than ANY cats. Period.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          10. Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          11. Shopping is not a sport.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          12. Anything you wear is fine. Really.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          13. You have enough clothes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          14. You have too many shoes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          15. Crying is blackmail. Use it if you must, but don't expect us to like it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          16. Your brother is an idiot, your ex-boyfriend is an idiot and your Dad probably is too.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          17. Ask for what you want. Subtle hints don't work.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          18. No, he doesn't know what day it is. He never will. Mark anniversaries on a calendar.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          19. Yes, pissing standing up is more difficult than peeing from point blank range. We're bound to miss sometimes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          20. Most guys own two to three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          21. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          22. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          23. Your Mom doesn't have to be our best friend.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          24. Foreign films are best left to foreigners.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          25. Check your oil.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          26. Don't give us 50 rules when 25 will do.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          27. Don't fake it. We'd rather be ineffective than deceived.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          28. It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          29. Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          30. If you don't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          31. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad and angry, we meant the other one.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          32. Let us ogle. If we don't look at other women, how can we know how pretty you are?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          33. You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done - not both.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          34. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          35. Christopher Columbus didn't need directions, and neither do we.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          36. Women wearing Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          37. Consider Golf a mini-vacation from you. We need it, just like you do.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          38. Telling us that the models in the men's magazines are airbrushed makes you look jealous and petty and it's certainly not going to deter us from reading the magazines.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          39. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          40. Anyone can buy condoms.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          AND FINALLY,
          <br/>
          <br/>
          41. Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out.
