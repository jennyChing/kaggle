         Doug Stanton enjoyed cooking as much as he enjoyed anything. Late in his life, he made dinner most nights with his ex-wife Laurel, who lived in an identical apartment one floor below his at their motel-style complex in a working-class suburb of Seattle. He told me his favorite dish was Tuna Helper. We put in two cans of albacore tunathe good stuffand then we put in a half a cup of frozen peas and some onions, all the while trying to keep the noodles
         <i>
          al dente
         </i>
         . At the time, Doug didnt have any teeth. He liked to add three-quarters of a cup of sour cream to make it, you know, good and fatty, but it makes it really tasty. He said this with a self-deprecating smile. He weighed 345 pounds. We dont usually have leftovers with that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was Dougs doctor when I was a resident in family medicine at the University of Washington and I looked forward to chatting for a few minutes at each visit. He had wide ranging interests: the Large Hadron Collider, the Seahawks, and whatever hot topic there was in national politics. Dougs medical problems were complex, and frustrating to both of us, but we always enjoyed the conversation. (This story alters several names and identifying details.)
        </p>
        <p>
         I called Doug again about a year after Id graduated from residency. He was no longer my patient but he agreed to meet me for a series of interviews about his life before disability and his experience with the disability system. Id taken a job doing physical examinations for Social Security disability applicants. The job had a flexible schedule, which, at the time, was worth its low prestige. There is a stereotype of people who apply for disability: they dont take care of themselves and dont want to work, exaggerating their maladies for a meager check. There is also a stereotype of the doctors who do this work: lazy and disinterested. I found the job fascinating. The more I learned about the disability system, the more I pondered its complexities: it provides a safety net but keeps people mired in poverty. Helpful services, including job retraining, are available, but arent advertised. And the system rests on a deeply flawed premisethat there is a way to objectively determine who is able to work and who is not. The claimants I met through the job were certain that obtaining disability benefits was going to improve their lives, and they were desperate to tell me their stories. Doug had been subsisting on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) since 2002, before I met him, and I wanted to hear his.
        </p>
        <p>
         Payments to the disabled and their families make up about 20 percent of new Social Security awards every year, with retirement benefits constituting most of the rest. Even though Social Security remains in surplus, with the amounts taken in from taxpayers exceeding the amount owed to them, American politicians fret about the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and blame the aging baby boomer generation. Annual awards to disabled workers, however, are increasing. According to the
         <i>
          Wall Street Journal
         </i>
         , in 2010 one of the two Social Security programs paid out $124 billion in benefits to 10.2 million people.

         In the 1980s, before Dougs life unraveled, he was making a good salary at an engineering firm in Seattle. His work was complex: he helped build a crane for NASA that assembled orbiters at Kennedy Space Center and an underwater crane for nuclear submarines. He and Laurel married in 1983 and she brought three children into the marriage. Doug quickly came to consider them his own. They owned a house in the working-class suburbs south of Seattle. But in the winter of 1996, when the tingling started, Dougs life started to fall apart.
        </p>
        <p>
         He felt it first in his right arm: little electrical pinpricks in the tips of his fingers that shot up to his elbow, causing an aching heaviness at his shoulder. After months of physical therapy the pain had only worsened and spread. An MRI showed the cause of the problem: his spine was collapsing around his spinal cord, crushing many of the nerves, and strangling the cord itself: cervical spinal stenosis. It was bad luckthere was no injury that caused it, no family history that would have predicted it. A neurosurgeon operated to stabilize the vertebrae and take pressure off the spinal cord, but the cord had suffered permanent damage and the pain never lessened. He started drinking to dull it, the drinking affected his work. Eventually he lost his job.
        </p>
        <p>
         He spent his severance on a drafting table so that he could continue to do part-time work from home. Then, too disabled to support himself completely, he applied for Social Security Disability Insurance.

         Before 1956, when Social Security expanded to include disability benefits, disabled workers had to rely on their families or on state welfare for financial subsistence. The 1956 federal bill was controversialit was expensive, and many politicians thought that paying the disabled not to work would lead to laziness. But Henry Jackson, a senator from Washington, passionately argued for the benefit: It should be clear to all of us that no matter at what age a person becomes totally and permanently disabled, he needs Social Security payments worse than a person who retires at sixty-five in good health. The worker who is disabled early in life usually has accumulated less savings than has an older person. He has more dependents to care for than has an older worker whose family has grown up and left home Retirement after ones working years can be planned for. Disability strikes without warning. President Eisenhower signed the bill, giving rise to SSDI, which allowed workers to collect their Social Security prior to age sixty-five if they became disabled. In 1974 the program added Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, which provided minimal payments to the disabled, including children, who had not contributed enough to Social Security to qualify for SSDI.
        </p>
        <p>
         Doctors were leery of the bill. They worried that they would be put in the uncomfortable position of deciding whether their patients, people they may have known for years, were eligible for this income. To deal with this concern, applicants are now often sent to doctors who work for private staffing firms that contract with the government. This was my job, independent medical examiner. On the basis of a forty-minute interview and examination, I was supposed to determine how disabled an applicant or claimant was.
        </p>
        <p>
         My first day was a Saturday, in Spokane, Washington. The receptionist showed me around the office, and pointed out where I could discreetly watch the claimants walk back out to their cars. This was so I could see if a limp disappeared, or a wheelchair went unused, once the claimant had left the office. Im sorry to say it but youll meet the scum of the earth doing this job, she explained.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did hundreds of disability exams over the next year, and while I did meet two people who were obviously faking, for the most part the stories I heard were heartbreaking: car accidents, massive strokes, lost jobs, dead spouses. Many people who apply for disability have lived through a tragedy. But the stories also told of the inefficiencies of the disability system. That first day in Spokane I met a man who had worked in manual labor his whole life, but for years had been getting crushing chest pain after walking a few blocks. His blood pressure was dangerously high. His condition was obviously treatable, but he did not have insurance so he had not been to a doctor in years. He knew that if he qualified for permanent disability he would eventually get Medicare or Medicaid and get proper treatment. He had no idea he could go to a community health center, a federally financed clinic where he could pay on a sliding-scale basis. With the right treatment and a less strenuous job, he would probably have not needed disability.

         Dougs first application for disability was denied. He was using his drafting table to freelance occasionally for his old company, barely making enough to cover his daily necessities and falling short on his mortgage. But because he was working, he wasnt considered disabled. Its likely that if hed applied for welfare instead of trying to freelance, he would have been approved right away. As it was, the pain continued to worseneven the lightest touch on his hands burned like an electric shock. He had to stop working altogether. He and Laurel sold the house and moved to a trailer park just in time to avoid foreclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
         This began the darkest period of his life. He was in constant pain, with no work, no health insurance, and no income. Laurel was struggling too. Shed been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her mood became increasingly volatile under the stress. Their marriage broke when Laurel heard from a friend in the trailer park that if she were single, she could qualify for SSI. She knew this would give her a small income and Medicaid coverage, and all of a sudden she felt that Doug was holding her back. In hindsight its likely that Laurel would have qualified even without separating from Doug, but misunderstandings like this are common.
        </p>
        <p>
         Doug, depressed and alone after she left, became overwhelmed with his pain. At that time I was actually exploring methods of suicide because the pain was so awful and I was getting nowhere with it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain is one of the most frequent complaints on disability applications, and one of the hardest to evaluate. The job of an independent medical examiner is often to determine a claimants residual functional capacity, the number of hours they can spend doing different physical activities, like standing, bending, reaching, or crawling. I had to estimate whether somebody could sit for two hours, four or eight. And while I could tell if a claimant looked comfortable sitting for twenty minutes while I asked them questions, I had no way to judge whether they could maintain this all day long, five days a week. The training for my job, in addition to my medical degree, had consisted of a handbook and a brief phone orientation. As I filed reports in the subsequent months, I often wondered if I was getting it right.

         Doctors have complained that they are unable to determine disability since the inception of the system. It was a concern which Senator Walter George of Georgia blithely dismissed in 1956 during debate on the Senate floor: Many American doctors are afraid that they cannot determine when a man or a woman is disabled Doctors have less confidence in themselves than I have. And while some cases of disability are very clear cutpeople whove suffered massive strokes, or have ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease)many disorders, especially those that cause pain, have no objective findings. A large number of disability claims are for back pain and psychiatric illnesses, conditions which the medical community does not completely understand and for which the diagnoses can be quite subjective.

        </blockquote>
        <p>
         I bought extra books and searched medical journals to see if I could find any information about how to make more rigorous determinations. I couldnt. Physicians Mark Melhorn and James Talmage, considered authorities in this field, have authored hundreds of papers and collaborated on several textbooks. In general, their arguments are based on four assumptions:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Working people are healthier and live longer than nonworking people.
        </p>
        <p>
         2. People who retire early due to disability are less healthy than people who retire early for other reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
         3. Doctors are not good at estimating how much people can work.
        </p>
        <p>
         4. Pain is not necessarily bad for your health.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some medical evidence supports each of these. But the conclusion that Melhorn and Talmage draw is something of a leap. They argue that people with disabilities should return to work, particularly if pain is the only thing stopping them. It almost certainly doesnt make sense for someone like Doug, whose pain was so debilitating it led to contemplations of suicide. Additionally, this is not how physicians are trained to approach medical problems. For most illnesses, the diagnosis derives mainly from what a patient tells a doctor. The physical exam, lab tests, and X-rays then help confirm what is already suspected. In disability determination, however, physicians are supposed to use only these objective factors since the claimant can be motivated to be untruthful in order to receive benefits. Pain is subjective and not supposed to be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
         Doug searched for ways to deal with his pain, and, through word of mouth, found his way to a community health center. There a neurologist recommended pain medications for him, medicines originally developed to combat seizures but which seem to alter the way the brain perceives pain. They were expensive, but Doug, resourceful with the Internet, figured out how to get them for free from the drug companies charity programs. The medications helped, the pain eased, and the thoughts of suicide stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the pain receded, his life started to become more stable. He stopped drinking, moved in with his mother, and after applying yet again he finally qualified for disability benefits. After a mandatory two-year waiting period, he qualified for Medicare. (In addition to the income support, recipients of SSDI can also get Medicare health benefits, generally after a two-year waiting period. Those who qualify for SSI usually receive Medicaid without a delay.)

         In the 1950s it was estimated that 250,000 people would be eligible initially for the new disability benefit. By December 1974, nearly 4 million adults were receiving disability payments, and by December 2005 the number had grown to 7.1 million. This increase in people who are considered too disabled to work has far outpaced the growth of the population, and its happened in the context of astounding advances in medicine, which have made formerly debilitating illnesses treatable. Although the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 attempted to make the workplace more hospitable for those with disabilities, it did not lead to increased employment for the disabled, nor a decline in disability applications.
        </p>
        <p>
         As of this year, Social Security is reportedly paying out more in benefits than it collects in revenue, putting pressure on the system to become more financially sustainable. Many economists propose stricter requirements for disability, letting far fewer people onto the rolls.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          With the arbitrary nature of the medical determination, getting approved for disability probably depends on persistence as much as anything.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         This is what happened in the Netherlands eight years ago: the Dutch tightened their criteria for disability and required employers to contribute to some of the disability payments. They were able to decrease the number of people on disability rolls by 15 percent (the U.S. has never seen any drop in disability recipients) and were able to show that those people had not simply transferred their needs to other government security programs, but were actually back at work. However, the Netherlands has a compulsory health insurance program, so the disabled, who have higher health care needs, were able to continue receiving health care no matter what type of employment they could find.
        </p>
        <p>
         The assumption is that many people who get denied disability payments will eventually find a way to go back to work. This is obviously not true for the most severely disabled, but the Dutch showed that it should be true for some. However, in the U.S., many claimants who are denied Social Security dont return to work. They reapply for Social Security over and over again, meanwhile managing to fund their lives with help from family, friends, and the state.
        </p>
        <p>
         This patience often pays off. With the arbitrary nature of the medical determination, getting approved for disability probably depends on persistence as much as anything. Most disability applications are initially denied, but many decisions get overturned later. In 2005, for every 100 disability claims decided, sixty-four were initially denied. Twenty-two of these denials appealed for reconsideration, and sixteen were eventually successful. And because the appeal must happen within sixty days, many of those that dont appeal have simply missed the deadline and, like Doug, apply from scratch again, often getting approved in a subsequent application.

         Claire Hobart is in her forties and has advanced osteoarthritis in her left hip. Her doctor is a former colleague of mine, and, like Doug, she agreed to discuss her struggles with the disability system. She has a high school diploma and worked for years as a waitress and cashier. When she was in her early thirties her hip started aching and she had trouble standing for hours behind a cash register. Five years ago the pain got so bad that she stopped working and applied for disability. She was denied. She reapplied and was denied again.
        </p>
        <p>
         After five years of being unemployed, Claire is poor. When I spoke with her over a year ago, she shared a one-bedroom house in Seattle with her boyfriend, her seventeen-year-old son, her niece, her nieces boyfriend, and a terrier named Little Feet. There was a full-sized mattress in the living room and the sofa was also made up as a bed. Rent was eight hundred dollars a month: Claire got 453 dollars a month from welfare and her boyfriend worked intermittently as a house painter. Her niece was out of work. Welfare entitled Claire to basic health benefits from the state, but once her son turned eighteen her welfare would disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the SSI denial letters Claire received, she was told that she should be able to get a job that did not involve standing, and they suggested that she consider a secretarial job. Claire was skeptical that somebody with no secretarial experience, who could not type, could get that sort of job. Instead, her plan was to get approved for disability, qualify for Medicaid, then receive a hip replacement and regain some function, maybe even enough to return to work. So even after her many denials, Claire was not looking for work. She was applying again for SSI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The denial letters Claire received did not tell her, and she had no way of knowing, that she could qualify for job retraining with the federally financed, state-administered departments of vocational rehabilitation. DVRs offer career counseling to help the disabled find jobs that will accommodate them. They will arrange for vocational training courses and internships, and they offer financial assistance with college. If clients need appropriate clothes for a job interview, DVR can even give them one hundred dollars towards an outfit.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Poverty is closely linked with poor health, and the trivial size of disability benefits condemns the disabled to a life of poverty.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Even with these resources and a dedicated staff, DVR results are not spectacular. Each of the thirteen counselors at the Seattle office carries a caseload of about 100 clients. They are expected to find a job, a position which the client must keep for at least ninety days, for twenty-five of the 100 within a year. The manager of the Seattle office estimated that only two or three of her counselors would be able to make the yearly goal. And many of the disabled who make it back into the work force still collect disability. I attended an orientation where many prospective clients were concerned about enrolling in the program because they didnt want to lose their benefit checks. The presenter reassured them: A lot of you may be receiving SSI, SSDI. It is not our intent to get you off that You can often earn up to nine hundred dollars a month on top of SSI or SSDI. In order to encourage the disabled to return to the workforce, they are allowed to earn income to supplement their benefit (the amount of income depends on the benefit amount).
        </p>
        <p>
         When I talked with Jen Bean, a benefits coordinator who helps DVR clients understand their various entitlements, she insisted that about one-third to one-half of the people she counsels eventually relinquish at least part of their benefits. But her objective, she explained passionately, is not to get people off of the disability rolls, but to help them out of poverty in any way she can. Her goal is worthy: poverty is closely linked with poor health, and the trivial size of disability benefits condemns the disabled to a life of poverty. Its not clear that disability benefits improve the health of the disabled or their quality of life.

         For the last years of his life, Doug received regular health care and his monthly disability checks. He got eighteen hundred dollars per month, more than the average (eleven hundred dollars), because the benefit rate is based on pre-disability earnings. After his mother passed away, he floated through long-term motels but eventually found a subsidized apartment building, the same one Laurel lived in. Laurels finances were precarious but Doug made sure she always had enough for her necessities. Shes on SSI, receiving just under seven hundred dollars a month.
        </p>
        <p>
         They reconciled a few years ago, and between eating and watching TV, they spent most of the day together. This life was sedentary and Doug gained weight, causing a number of health problems. His legs got swollen and broke out in sores. He was supposed to sleep with a mask to help him breathe; he had severe heart disease. Not surprisingly, he struggled with depression. The pain remained and after Medicares prescription drug service started, the drug companies stopped the charity programs hed relied on. He had to stop one of his pain medications because the expense put him in the donut hole of Medicare Part D. (After one reaches certain medication expenditure, usually 2700 dollars, one has to pay the additional costs, until you reach a higher threshold, 6100 dollars, when Medicare kicks in again.) As a result, his pain was less well controlled than it had been in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dougs story could be any of ours. He went to college, worked hard, and had a family. His illness, not the disability system, destroyed this life. But the system didnt help him put it back together with the dignity or autonomy he would have liked. Because Social Security will eventually run out of money, it will be forced to change. When it does, it will be an opportunity to fix the holes, to coordinate agencies and better counsel beneficiaries so that they can use the skills they have, and the skills they can acquire to rebuild their lives.

          Disinterested means neutral. I believe the author meant lazy and UNinterested.

          An excellent article and very true to reality. However, in southern California at least, the idea of a Consultative Exam lasting 40 minutes is a dream. I accompany all my clients to their CEs. The average is 20 minutes, often less, never over 30. The record for a mental exam was nine minutes, and the doctor was still able to fill nine pages of boiler plate language in his report.
         </p>
         <p>
          Pain and fatigue are the most common symptoms and the most difficult to measure, so although they claim otherwise, SSA often ignores or downplays them as disabling symptoms.

          Its unfortunate that such a well crafted article would contain such a glaringly incorrect assumption.  The assumption is that Social Security will run out of money someday.  It wont so long as the program continues to exist.  What will happen is that somewhere near 2025, The payroll taxes will only be enough to cover 3/4 of the benefits.  This will continue for sometime until the baby boomers largely die off.  Once the population ratios of old to young return to pre-boomer levels, the system will be solvent once again.
         </p>
         <p>
          Moreover, the assumption discounts the ability for us to do any number of things to prevent the system from paying out fewer benefits.  E.g. lifting the cap on income eligible for payroll taxation; a more open immigration policy, etc.

          Hi Ryan,
         </p>
         <p>
          You make a great point. We all thought that was addressed in the article here: Even though Social Security remains in surplus, with the amounts taken in from taxpayers exceeding the amount owed to them, American politicians fret about the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and blame the aging baby boomer generation.
         </p>
         <p>
          But we agree it could have gone a lot further into those demographics than we did. Speaking on my own behalf, Im happy that you have here. So thanks for writing.
         </p>

          I identify completely with this article. The author could have been describing my own experience with the SSDI application process.
         </p>
         <p>
          By an interesting coincidence, Im in Washington State as well  just 100 miles north of the authors alma mater.
         </p>
         <p>
          In my case, which was settled only one year ago, I was forty-eight hours from having my home auctioned out from under me when my appeal was finally granted. It was only due to the concurrent personal intervention of my U.S. Representative that I was able to use my award to save my home through the Making Home Affordable Act.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was lucky. But I persevered with Social Security from Day One. I was a stone around their necks. I did a whole lot more than my first lawyer, in fact. So much more that he fired me as a client  he couldnt keep up with me. A week later, all my months of hard work paid off.
         </p>
         <p>
          The moral of this, really, is that if you are disabled, you must damn-well be prepared to advocate for yourself. The lawyers are lazy, the doctors dont care, and the process is grueling and frustrating and sometimes infuriating. I actually got to a point where -um- I earned a visit from the local constabulary after a particularly heated telephone conversation. But, then, I have anger issues. 
         </p>
         <p>
          In any case, thanks so much to the author for this article. She addressed the issue more dispassionately than I could ever have, and I can attest to the fact that shes right on the money with it.
         </p>
         <p>
          A shout-out too to Ezra Klein, who turned me on to this.

          I agree on the time frame, I had no idea that they were supposed to give you 40 minutes! When I took my son in, the doctor saw him for maybe 15 minutes! Of course we were denied!

          I am a long term applicant for SSDI, which I lost my credits by not appealing my original denial for, now at the beginning applying for SSI. No attorneys want to help me because my possible income wont be very much, its not worth their time, Im married and my husband makes a decent living. Im applying for the Medicaid benefits I will automatically qualify for. We have six children, so my husbands income doesnt stretch far, Im widowed by my first husband, father of my oldest child. I also receive social security death benefits for my oldest from her bio fathers death. We divorced before he died, so I dont get spousal death benefits from his demise. The little bit of income I might qualify for if Im ever approved for SSI would help, but were mainly in it for the healthcare I need desperately because Im so disabled.
         </p>
         <p>
          The money we spend on Dr copays, prescription copays, and travel (I have a rare disease that docs in my area are not able to treat) is driving us into poverty! We live in Henderson, NV and have to travel to Los Angeles, CA to UCLA for one of my most serious, life-threatening problems, Cushings disease. We dole out cash for gas, car rental (our family car wont make it and we have no heat or A/C), hotel stays (very expensive in CA), accommodations for our children, time off work for my husband, its a mess and very very expensive. Over Christmas we had to go to UCLA and back three times! The month before, November, we had to go twice and the first time I was admitted for over a week fora second brain surgery and hubby couldnt afford a hotel and no one was available to help with the children so he had to make multiple drives from NV to CA and CA to NV in a car. I had to be alone for a very scary, complicated procedure and recovery I was alone too. It was highly recommended we stay nearby in case of problems, but we couldnt afford to let a hotel for my recovery, and again, no one to care for our children.
         </p>
         <p>
          I had complications and my regular doc in town said he cant do anything, too much liability and room for error, he said he wasnt qualified to treat me!! Weve made many trips back to UCLA since my surgery on election day, one trip I was so sick, and got so much worse from the travel, they begged to admit me then and there when I arrived, but we couldnt afford it, even when they offered financing in the copays. I am exactly the type of disability candidate that should be approved and should have been approved long ago without the fight. Im still fighting and praying for approval. Ive been unable to work since 2004!!
         </p>
         <p>
          I started applying as soon as I realized I wasnt going to be able to work again. Five years later, 2009. I expected to get better. I didnt get any definitive diagnosis until 2008. I was almost dead by then n, and by that time had already exceeded the average life expectancy for someone with my condition left untreated. I had surgery in 2008 and when I applied in 2009, sicker than I had ever been, even pre-surgery, I was denied because I didnt have insurance which meant I didnt have medical documentation backing my claim. Social security assumed my surgery had cured me. For my 2009 evaluation, they sent me to a heart doctor and a psychologist. That didnt even make sense?!
         </p>
         <p>
          I reapplied in 2011, again without insurance. This time, they didnt claim I could work, but they did say they didnt have enough information to make a favorable decision. Im on my husbands employment insurance now, he had to find a new job to insure me. Less pay and more expensive to carry insurance, but SSI didnt approve my claim and I needed another brain surgery right away. We were very lucky that pre existing condition wasnt brought up.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now Im to the point I might not survive all that is plaguing me. Im bound to wheelchair, I cant even make it to the bathroom in the master bedroom from the bed anymore. I can barely get out of bed or stay awake. I can hardly eat and Im having trouble keeping down enough fluids or getting needed nutrients. Ive missed doctor appointments because Ive felt too horrible to get out of bed!! My care is suffering because Im so sick. Im expected by UCLA to come back for radiation treatments that could be five days a week for up to eight weeks, I have no idea how we can afford it or who will watch our kids.
         </p>
         <p>
          I need Medicaid and any cash would be helpful. In the beginning I would have been highly thankful to get approved for Medicaid only and not be eligible for any cash amount. Ive joined online support groups with people with Cushings and some of the other illnesses I have. I can tell you from conversing with others in need of approval, many of them would be satisfied with approval for Medicaid or Medicare only.
         </p>
         <p>
          Maybe social security could offer a disability program for disabled persons to receive medical benefits only. This would save the system a lot of money and please lot of disabled people who really need it. It would also knock out a lot lazy fakers who just want some cash to skate by on while they dont work because something hurts, or fix people who are disabled but need medical services out of the realm of a county health program. Maybe they could go back to work afterbeing treated.
         </p>
         <p>
          Theres good possibility that if medical care was afforded to me sooner and ongoing that I might have got needed care in time that I wouldnt be in as bad of shape and I might have been fixable enough to return to work after operations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Why dont they offer Medicaid and Medicare to disabled people without paying cash benefits, long enough to get them healthy to work again? Save the cash and medical for the permanently disabled and very very very poor. It would save the system money and help those in dire and true need of help!! Even at this point, if Medicaid would approve my request for approval without SSI agreeing Im disabled and sending me money every month, Id be a Hell of a lot better off, even though chances are Im not going to make it much longer as it is.
