        When did it become possible to purchase food at a gas station or at a clothing store? Many U.S. citizens are at an age where fast food seems a way of life. But, fast food and industrial farming have gravely injured human health, animal welfare, and the environment. Fortunately, choicesare available, and the ability to choose

        The following list details some of the issues that individuals face when making organic choices. Are organic foods really more nutritious? Can they lead to better health? Are they safer for the environment, and can they lead to a more ethical environment for the animals that America consumes? Some answers remain debatable, but  on the whole  an apple grown organically and locally seems a better choice in the long run than an apple grown with pesticides and shipped from a foreign country.

        Definitions for the term, organic, have been modified over the past decade by theNational Organic Standards Board (

        ), and they often seem confusing for consumers. Supposedly, organic food is produced by using sustainable agricultural production practices. Not permitted are most conventional pesticides; fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients, or sewage sludge; bioengineering; or ionizing radiation. Organic meat, poultry eggs, and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. But, there are various grades to the term, organic, and the following definitions closely define the terms listed below:

          Having worked on an organic dairy I have found that article to be true. Treatment of animals is better and the health benefits are there. There are no anti-biotics or horomones in organic foods which is a plus for everyone.

         <p>
          I have been disappointed with whole foods, trader joes, and many other so called organic stores say that their products are natural, organic, etc. when they are not. I have researched many stores for some time, especially whole foods and found many of the personal and body care items to have the most chemicals, parabens, and bad ingredients in them. The only place that I have been happy with is a site called
          <a href="http://www.egreenplace.com" rel="nofollow">
           http://www.egreenplace.com
          </a>
          . Their whole purpose is to pre-screen every ingredient. Thats why they are awesome and very unique in this green industry that you thought you could trust!
