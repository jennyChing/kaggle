        For breakfast, up here in the High Doganate, I toasted a couple of things that were described as crumpets, and put good butter and maple syrup on them. There were six of these crumpets in the package, and the rest will go to the gulls of Humber Bay. How did I come to own them (the crumpets; I dont own the gulls)? This is painful to recount, but Ill steel myself.
       </p>
       <p>
        You see, they were on sale for a dollar at the Inner Parkdale No Thrills supermarket. What I was doing in there will be the first question, your honour; I admit to going in sometimes because it is half-a-block away, and open late. My intention was to fetch table cream for my coffee in the morning (itself a dicey, homogenized product), but fell to wandering. Please dont tell the pope the place was air conditioned: a draw during the continental mid-July. I succumbed to another item that was on sale, too. (Bear in mind, this Idleblog is only for my friends.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Okay, it was some chicken legs on styrofoam, under plastic film. I know what youre thinking; but I will go about this in the Poor Punjabi way, and make them into a passable curry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Still, the purchase of items on sale, from chain retail facilities, fills me with self-loathing. While neither behaviour is strictly confessable, at least from my reading of the
        <em>
         CCC
        </em>
        , shopping corporate is a breach of my principles, and getting suckered by a sale compounds it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday I touched on the Benedict options now in the air for Catholics, and others who aspire to break with pattern, and become decent people. Such options are often dismissed as pie-in-ye-sky. To the contemporary urbanized troll, with more borrowed cash than he knows what to do with (whether borrowed by himself, his employer, or his government), organic is sufficient. The capitalists now print organic on every second label, as a trick to double their prices so they can cut them by 15 percent in sales; and urban trolls are (ask any farmer) notoriously easy to con. Free range and other terms are used with like vagueness. (Essentially, a chicken is not free.) Fair trade means theyre paying off the Marxist insurgents.
       </p>
       <p>
        To conservatives  the term for a market demographic  back to the land means hippie. For those with money it means acquiring a cottage and a motorboat. Most exponents of traditional values would be at a loss if moved back fifty years.
       </p>
       <p>
        But even in this vexed business of shopping, it is possible to do something now. Cut your purchases by 50 percent, by doing without the rubbish, then be prepared to pay a premium on everything else you buy. Shop exclusively at family-owned stores, which must charge more because they cannot negotiate Walmart-scale wholesale prices. They also pay hideous rent to ruthless landlords, face malicious and frequently corrupt regulators from municipal, provincial, and federal agencies, bleed lifeblood to the sadistic tax collectors, and must humour customers who are possibly insane. They die like flies when a franchise operation moves in next door, blazoning signage to make them invisible  including flyer and lifestyle advertising, designed and lab-tested to inculcate Pavlovian demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        To compensate, the family enterprise stocks goods not available elsewhere. Staff are apt to know what the item is, and where it came from; how to cook it, or what the better alternative might be. Having recognized their customer by name. Indeed, one comes to know them  to know when, Its a girl!; that its Alexs
        <em>
         bar-mitzvah
        </em>
        , or Jimmys graduation, or Andreas getting married; that Uncle Tomas has died. I am thinking here much less of mom-and-pop variety stores  selling trinkets, sweets, and lottery tickets to the local underclass, sometimes at the risk of their lives  than of specialized provisioners from butchers to costermongers, whose goods are also more likely to be fresh; and which, when they arent, rot honestly in the absence of all the conventional industrial preservatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Immigrants are especially to be recommended as shopkeepers: a constant reminder that few foreign cultures are as lazy as ours, or as disgusting in their eating habits. Though in the farmers markets I find there are still some white people capable of intelligent work, as opposed to time-serving.
       </p>
       <p>
        For machines, and staff trained to emulate them, cannot match their service. To be a person, rather than a mechanism interacting with a mechanism, is already half the way to Catholic. Moreover, one may acquire the capacity for self-loathing, which is the only known cure for self-esteem, and which can potentially take one the rest of the way home.

        Typically, people who dont know anything about a subject, cant know that they dont know anything about it, and thus, the suggestion that they dont know is lost on them. One cannot debate with a log. It is, as I have hinted before, a problem of democracy, with its doctrine that everyone has an equal right to an opinion, and the majority will rule  contradicting itself should it so will from moment to moment, even on the most fundamental questions of right and wrong, while acknowledging no responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of each act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or rather, it is not a doctrine but a conceit, demonstrated in the manipulation of people by the mass media of news and entertainment, and their favoured politicians and judges. Note, for instance, the speed at which an overwhelming majority opposed to gay marriage, able easily to win referenda in state after state, was converted in a couple of election cycles to gleeful, voluble, homophilia. One side of a
        <em>
         soi-disant
        </em>
        debate was suddenly raised in volume, the arguments of the other denied, until a tsunami was formed to wash away the surviving civilized benchmarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the course of this wash-over, in which the procreative significance of marriage was buried in the mud, the true history of the development was clarified. No sex without babies, no babies without sex (a rule-of-thumb for the Catholic position, once shared by all Christians), was first uprooted by the promotion of contraception. Sex, which in natural law is oriented to a primary purpose  the conception of children  was deflected to another purpose, the fulfilment of lust. This was then advanced through song dance and the movies, with a glibness that would once have beggared the imagination of any decent soul. The terms love and sex are now used interchangeably. Thus, the right to marry any person with whom one is currently fornicating is established in law. It became the right to marry whomever you love  and then divorce and remarry with mandatory public approval, and the States bureaucratic sanction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or from another angle, it was a dramatic victory for consumerism. This was brought home to me most recently when I went to withdraw some money from a bank machine, and while I waited for the computer to confirm my password, was shown a cartoon of the banks mascot (a little bowler-hatted man) waving the rainbow flag and cheering on this years Pride Parade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankers can discern the colour of money, and do not take excessive risks when they have any choice. More generally, corporate America, which formerly had nothing to say about sex, beyond sentimental affirmations of family to promote mortgages, extra spending, and consumer debt  and had no opinions on things like gay marriage until the day before yesterday  have now made a cynical calculation. They have little to lose and much to gain, buying into this latest trend towards social atomism. Capitalists, in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, have a big stake in disposable income. The small-income family, with children and religious commitments, is not the side on which their bread is buttered, and serious moral questions lie outside their chosen domain. The DINKS (double income, no kids) now rule, are extremely vain, and given to moral posturing. The flattering, supportive, sanctimony from the bank thus makes it easier to pick off this primary marketing target with consumer loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Government tax collectors share the same point-of-view, or have come to share it since the whole idea of thinking more than a few revenue quarters ahead, or one election cycle, has come to guide all statist thinking. Children dont pay taxes; there will be another government by the time they have grown up. Meanwhile the pension demographics point to the next progressive social frontier, which is the promotion of euthanasia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those who do think ahead, are the environmentalists, who have discovered that they can capture government policy, and corporate lip-service too, with the same focus. The earths carrying capacity is taken as strictly finite, and the challenge is to cut down the human population to a more profitable core. Contraception, sterilization, abortion, gay marriage, euthanasia, and any other scheme that can decrease the surplus population, is a progressive cause  the culture of death as John-Paul II called it, with searing accuracy  and since the non-monied classes are those immediately slated for extinction, who among the monied will object?
       </p>
       <p>
        Only those, as I say, with some human decency, and the ability to think the implications through  a small and shrinking minority at present. We cannot prevail in any vote, nor dominate any mass market. We have suddenly become internal exiles, who might move to another country if we could, but there is nowhere to go that is not also globalizing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, the Benedict Option, proposed by Rod Dreher and getting some modest discussion (see
        <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher-tags/benedict-option/">
         here
        </a>
        ), contains a fatal flaw. It holds that in the footsteps of Benedict of Nursia (
        <em>
         c.
        </em>
        480543), we should beat a new monastic retreat. But several writers have spotted the problem: that Benedict and company had the luxury of not being pursued by a modern, inclusive Nanny State, with its GPS technology. Today, such a retreat would have to be negotiated with that State, which is to say, conceded by our enemies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet the idea is basically sound  that to be exemplary and positive, rather than just rebelliously negative, we must find ways to live with a degree of independence from the servile state at least equal to what all citizens enjoyed a few short generations ago. Background conditions being different, the methods of our withdrawal will be different: we must find ways to live independently of this devil, as it were, right under his nose.
       </p>
       <p>
        That, I think, is worth some practical attention. How, for instance, to arrange cash transactions that cut out commercial banks? To exclude large corporations, as much as possible, to the benefit of small family firms? To obviate or elude government regulation? To conserve wealth in forms the State cannot easily inflate or seize? How to reduce our footprint in the statistical economy, so that we become less visible to corporate and government trackers, and more important, remove ourselves from moral complicity in a public order that is less and less ambiguously satanic?
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, how to do it so attractively that we will inspire people to follow us, thus helping not only to destroy the Nanny State and its corporate and financial affiliates, but to rebuild a civilization worthy of what was assigned by God to the Estate of Man?

        We are getting ahead of ourselves, up here in the High Doganate: giving our lay sermon on todays (
        <em>
         usus antiquior
        </em>
        ) Gospel text last Monday; visiting Pluto five days before the American spacecraft; anticipating Saturdays talking points on Grexit, Friday. At the old
        <em>
         Idler
        </em>
        magazine we would flag articles we had written years before, on topics only now in the headlines, and boast: If you cant wait for the newspapers, read it all here.
       </p>
       <p>
        So with the Gospel covered, let us try to expound the Epistle in todays Mass, from Saint Paul to the Romans, touching on the mystery of our iniquity:
       </p>
       <p>
        Brethren: I speak a human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh; for as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity so now yield your members to serve justice unto sanctification. For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice. What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, life everlasting. For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God is life everlasting; in Christ Jesus our Lord.
       </p>
       <p>
        One might almost say he is commenting on our own pagan, post-Christian mores, looking forward through Christian eyes; though in the text he looks back to the pagan, pre-Christian Romans. Uncleanness seems a gentle, rather elderly English term, for the condition of our souls. Really it is not gentle at all, gents. We still know what it is physically to live in filth. The modern West is obsessively hygienic, and changes the bedsheets when they are soiled; but is indifferent to spiritual cleanliness. With the passage of time, we find it harder to imagine people who lived in acute discomfort from a knowledge of their sins. Our tactic is to stay free of that knowledge.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember this vividly from childhood, when I was in the culturally Protestant environment of a small Ontario town. There were a few Catholics, perhaps five families of which I was aware. All adhered to the stereotype of large, extended and poor. Some of them compounded their isolation by being able to speak French. The culture was already post-religious, but the notion that Catholics were dirty people had survived the transition. So had the habit of excluding Catholics from social clubs, including business management. They took jobs in the brewery (a low-wage employer), or in one case (that of an Italian immigrant family), raised rabbits in their backyard, and were somehow able to manage a fruit and vegetable shop on Main Street. It was open at the front, and fine Protestant ladies would spot flies on the bananas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though hardly born into the Catholic fold, I was a genetic freak: for as long as I can remember I have been pro-Catholic. It may have run in the family: my parents told me to play with the Catholic kids  and with Jews, if I could find any. They made a point themselves of mixing across the race-line, and buying anything a Catholic man was peddling from door to door (desperately trying to feed his family), such as powdered milk (the bags of which piled up in our basement). And from the age of nine, when I first fell in love, I noticed Catholic girls were prettier. (My Beatrice carried the name, Liddy; she did not approve of me, however, and said her mother had warned Id be going to Hell with all the other Protestant children.)
       </p>
       <p>
        More history could be divulged, but I have focused upon this fragment only to remember the North American meme, that Catholics were dirty people. And let me add, they knew it. And with large families, they always had colds. But for Mass, all dressed in their ill-fitting Sunday best, and the girls under lace mantillas. And all that wonderful
        <em>
         kitsch
        </em>
        hanging on Catholic walls, so adverse to the metastasizing suburban Bauhaus. The thought of them, queueing for Confession, brought strange fancies to young Protestant minds.
       </p>
       <p>
        To this day, I wake some mornings with the thought, Good Lord, Im a Catholic. Some drollness must be understood, for it is recited in the tone of, omigod I have leprosy.
       </p>
       <p>
        And sometimes I think, perhaps, I joined just as all of them were leaving, in the spirit of Vatican II. One by one, or one thousand by another thousand, they grew into North Americans, nostalgic for, but also ashamed of their background  recovering Catholics determined not to be excluded from a world that, as Liddys mother said, was going straight to Hell.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sense, not that the people down the road are dirty, but that one is filthy oneself, is now bred out of the children in their schools if not in their homes. In the sixties, guilt was made into a target, and acceptance might be the term today. This does not mean acceptance of all others, for traditional Catholics are treated just the same. It means self-acceptance; liberation from guilt. If, for instance, one has sexual appetites of the kind once condemned as perverted, the instruction now is to self-celebrate, to march in a parade as the Orangemen used to do. Morality requires only that you practise safe sex with condoms, follow the dietary trends, and maintain an outward show of smiley-face niceness, like a bank teller.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sex is always news in our mass porno culture, but down below the headline events, it is the same interminable story. What applies to sex, applies less noisily to everything else. It is expressed through omnipresent lifestyle advertising: You deserve a break today. Break follows break, and the shards of our civilization are dissolving into dark wet dirty sand. This, as Pope Benedict observed, is the key environmental problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        That we are living in filth. That we are proud of it.

        A Spanish bishop, Jos Ignacio Munilla of San Sebastin, tweeted the picture of the pope being presented with a hammer-and-sickle crucifix by Bolivias Marxist president. His remark was: The height of pride is to manipulate God in the service of atheist ideologies. It is good to know we still have bishops who understand that.

        Everything is being reported through the poison mist of the mass media. This includes quotes from Pope Franciss homilies and speeches which may or may not be correctly translated, but which invariably omit crucial qualifications. To the Devil, whom I believe to be editor-in-chief of this worlds mass media (both Left and Right)  quotes are important. He would prefer to get them right: as accurate as possible, in order to be as misleading as possible. Example:
       </p>
       <p>
        If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?
       </p>
       <p>
        That is an accurate quote; but if we leave out searches for the Lord and has good will it means something other than what was more completely said. If
        <em>
         anyone
        </em>
        searches for the Lord and has good will  God bless him. The pope might then have added, And if he is sexually disordered, whether outwardly gay or straight, he will be struggling with the divine command for chastity. The pope didnt say that, but would, from everything he has ever said, most certainly agree with it. Nor is there any likelihood at all that the pope is going to change his opinion, which is incumbent upon every son of the Church, as it has been these last twenty centuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        We cannot judge what we cannot know; we cannot read the interior soul of any other human being, except in glimpses, and then only through genuine, holy love. But we can know what is Church doctrine, and it is wrong to confuse it. It is also wrong to be reckless in stating it; to play to the gallery in a selective way. And this is especially dangerous when the gallery is full of journalists, animated by malice for the Catholic Church.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of the remarks made by the pope, especially in Bolivia, may be all but incomprehensible to an observer who knows little about the intense game being played there between Church and State  with its long, long history. The same, however, in Ecuador and now Paraguay, though the games and the histories vary from country to country. And the popes remarks do vary with the terrain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading this week something on the extraordinary history of Paraguay, I began to get a clearer view of where Bergoglio was coming from, long before he became pope. It is like a good joke, where you have to be there to understand the punch lines fully. But when one is not the local bishop, but pope, I should think reticence would be wise. For when the remarks reach the outside world, through the filters, there will be terrible misunderstandings, and worse perhaps, terrible understandings.
       </p>
       <p>
        A pope must present the Catholic Christian faith, universally. That is why he must remain so far as possible aloof from passing political issues; and moreover, be well and broadly informed when he must wade in  and then, not in a general theoretical way, but on some very specific point that needs addressing, with clarity. Usually, alas, it is something that must be condemned, and there will be no room to dance around the point. The point must be made so there can be no confusion, and every phrase must be weighed to that end.
       </p>
       <p>
        He will inevitably be a creature of his time and place, as the pope is so obviously, as political thinker, a product of Peronist Argentina. He cannot help that, yet must constantly remember it. I am myself such a product, of different time and place. Even when I oppose a current trend, I am in some sense captured by it, and even my English language puts blinkers on me. We should indeed struggle to free ourselves from temporal narrowness and parochialism, but we are human and cannot break entirely free.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joseph Ratzinger was very German, G.K. Chesterton very English. A friend writes this morning of reading the formers
        <em>
         Introduction to Christianity
        </em>
        , and the latters
        <em>
         Everlasting Man
        </em>
        , back to back. He was struck how, from such different backgrounds, the two men came to essentially the same grand philosophy of history. The question is whether Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, from his inevitably Argentine perspective, and using the tools at his command, also leads us to the common universal.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a great deal of truth in much of the popes critique of capitalism, and from what I can make out a great deal of confusion, too, leading to falsehood. (For instance, to blame the capitalists for creating material poverty is to get it precisely backwards; they have created instead an empty and spiritually eviscerating wealth.) What I found in my own recent tour of his environmental encyclical, for instance, was a cats cradle through which are woven many golden strands. My instinct is to take the gold and burn the rest away, less because it is wrong, than because it is not useful; that engaging too carefully with the wool only complicates the tangle.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the meanwhile, go to Mass, and cultivate the key Catholic Christian relationship, which was never with the pope of the moment, but will always be with Jesus Christ.

        ), the learned Michael Paterson-Seymour, suggests my review and outlook for Greece is too optimistic. The notion that they
        <em>
         might
        </em>
        recover cannot be right. For any way you look at it, theyre in checkmate. The average age in that country is now greater than that of Alexis Tsipras; the average woman bears only one child and one-third; there arent enough left of child-bearing age to reverse the trend towards extinction, and as the gentleman so delicately puts it, By the end of the century, their language will be spoken exclusively in hell.
       </p>
       <p>
        They could still be Euro-rescued, indeed: but that is the worst thing that could happen, over a longer term that is growing ever shorter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, in the daily evolution of the news, we are told that Angela Merkel is blinking, that the French have undermined German resolve, that some sort of package may still be hashed together, since the Greeks are getting scared, and learning to say please. Notwithstanding Greek promises have been false in the past, and those of Greek socialists are notoriously worthless, and this latest lot of Greek socialists is exceptionally irresponsible  their bankers are expected to take them at their word, on their latest promises to reform.
        <em>
         This

        time, we are to suppose, they wont just take the money and run until the next crisis meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should think a banker who would consider offering such as Tsipras and Syriza a last-minute bailout, is just not a man.
       </p>
       <p>
        And Angela (with that delicious hard-G), well, at least shes a woman, as a Canadian parliamentarian once replied, when heckled across the floor that he was in bed with Thatcher.  While offensively Prussian in moments, she has an iron lady reputation that strikes me as unearned.  She has noticed that German taxpayers are picking up the tab for Greek pensioners who get more than Germans.  How dare she wimp out! 
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: center;">

       </p>
       <p>
        Now seriously, gentle reader, we are being reminded that there is truly no way out  no foreseeable practical and material escape  from the Nanny State web we have woven. Except by catastrophe, and/or miracle. My fascination with Greece is, as I have said, to see what happens as that state breaks down. Greece is unrepresentative in some ways; she never was a truly Western country, and thus even her way of abandoning the Christian faith is different from the Western. Since the West freed her from the Infidel Turk, Greece has had the luxury to pick and choose between spiritual destinies. The West offered three: the Catholic, the Protestant, and the Revolutionary. Greece chose to dress her post-Byzantine, Orthodox self in the robes of Marianne, goddess of fake Liberty. They dont fit, cant, and she has experienced one wardrobe malfunction after another. Whereas the French, whom she most likes to emulate, at least know how to carry off satanic modernism in style.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding, the material facts of Nanny State are universal, and Greece can now serve as an illustration of their consequences  for the simple reason that she has made more mistakes, faster, than any other European country.
       </p>
       <p>
        My fondest hope was that the failure of Greece would provoke a genuine re-assessment of the European Union. My worst fear is that it would instead make Europes commissars circle their wagon (the EU flag unintentionally represents this), and advance the continental nannyism in the vain belief that they can somehow save it. This, I observe, is what most likely happens. Or to put this another way, for the third time in a century, Europe has embarked on a mission of self-destruction, and will not turn back.
       </p>
       <p>
        The correct response, to my humble mind, would have been on two fronts. First, to acknowledge that Greece cant pay, and therefore write off the debts. Let them start again from scratch, according to their lights, providing whatever humanitarian aid can be afforded, but making clear it is a gift, and therefore delivering it through visibly European (and North American) agencies. Never let anyone think he is receiving gifts by right, and thus confuse gifts with payment. But dont kick Greece out of anything; they have as much right to use euros while unwinding as the Argentines had to use U.S. dollars through their last bankruptcy. In defiance of post-modern sentimentalism, I would say it is possible to be both charitable,
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        firm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, to begin a peaceful disassembly of most of the pan-European scheme, including the euro currency, which doesnt and cant work. Restore marks, francs, lire, pesetas; but also gradually downsize the Brussels bureaucracy to what it can and did do reasonably well  as a clearing house for trade transactions. This would be sane, now the ambition of a European nation is proved to have been foolish in itself. It would be insane, politically, to leave it to the member countries respective nationalist lunatics to achieve the same end by jingo, with the violence that follows inevitably from that.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is in this greater (political, not religious) light that I think another bailout for Greece is a horror. It means Europes politicians are accelerating down a blind alley  the political equivalent of the spirit of Vatican II.

        I stand accused, by a most solemn and condescending correspondent, of mistreating my finches. Not only do I demand of them conformity to my
        <em>
         Weltanschauung
        </em>
         a reasonable exchange, I would have thought, for my unending supply of sunflower seeds. (I care not what they
        <em>
         think
        </em>
        , or even what they say, elsewhere; so long as heresies are not chirped upon
        <em>
         my
        </em>
        balconata.) It is suggested that I am not providing them with a well-balanced diet.
       </p>
       <p>
        This lady keeps finches herself  in a
        <em>
         cage
        </em>
        . Consider that, gentle reader. They are a poor pair of Gouldian finches, locked in that prison. A cage, mind you  open to inspection and gawping from all sides. And a
        <em>
         pair
        </em>
         arbitrarily forced into co-habitation. A finch must choose his own mate; of this I am assured by all my avian acquaintances. They do not appreciate an arranged marriage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am told that I must vary my seeds, that I must mix sunflower with safflower, rapeseed, flax, whatever. That, rather than such filler as millets (which I have already abandoned, as ground feed), I should be providing millet spray for my finches to joyfully pick away at. (Ill perhaps consider it.) That they need protein from some boiled egg mixture. (Does she think they are cannibals?) That they need live insects. (But plenty volunteer themselves.) That I should buy pellets from some wretched pet store. (No person of the authentically Scotch coloration would enter such a place.) That they want leafy greens to shred apart. That I should choose brightly-coloured vegetables and fruits, and grate apples for them, and broccoli, and carrots, and so on through the alphabet. And then clean up after, lest any of this feast start rotting.
       </p>
       <p>
        My finches will continue to get sunflower seeds  and those only of the striped variety, which offend the beaks of the pigeons. No soft-shelled black oil varieties from me. And they will take them raw, unsalted, and unsorted. And if they defect to some liberals birdfeeder, good riddance to them. I want only Tory birds on my balconata, who take what they can get then push off.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are not Greek finches, lady.

        The American spacecraft,
        <em>
         New Horizons
        </em>
        , launched almost a decade ago, is as of this Earth morning, some two billion miles away on the other side of our Sun. It is approaching Pluto at an extraordinary speed, on a trajectory that will this coming Tuesday pass over the planet by less than eight thousand miles, before spinning off farther into the Kuiper belt. Aboard, it has equipment including cameras to gather more than one thousand times the data Mariner IV could assimilate during the first planetary fly-past, of Mars fifty years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those of my age will remember that childhood excitement: perhaps the most dramatic moment in exploration until the manned voyages to the Moon. Extraordinary vistas were opening; the conquest of space seemed to be at hand. But now, instead of 12 or 13 minutes, we wait more than five hours for the pictures to return; and the universe seems once again to be spreading out of our reach, far away. (God be with our little spaceship! Keep her online for us through the pass!)
       </p>
       <p>
        I gather it contains various mementos, including one ounce of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh (190697), who discovered Planet Pluto in 1930. (It has been reclassified recently as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union, but I invite gentle reader to ignore those killjoys.) Tombaugh was also a prolific discoverer of asteroids, and a flying saucer enthusiast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Too, let me add, a skilled astronomical draughtsman, whose sketches of what he saw of Mars and Jupiter through his telescopes are heritage property, to be carefully preserved. Drawings remain more detailed and informative than photographs, because the trained human eye can pick out features that film and pixels tend to blur. On the other hand, the human mind can be unaccountably whimsical, and can in this case work only with the material that optical equipment supplies. The closer the view, the more that can be seen, and it is a pity that today NASA uses draughtsmen only for garish, scientifictional publicity pictures. I attribute this to the general creeping scientism; they also toy with Earth climate data to get more sensational results.
       </p>
       <p>
        In an old class yearbook, from when I was eleven, my ambition in life is marked down as
        <em>
         astronomer
        </em>
        . Under fate, the class wag added,
        <em>

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Pluto I recall as a particular enchantment, and somewhere in my files there may still be a short, scientifictional story I wrote around that time, on a manned voyage to Pluto. I was rather staggered by the plot, on returning to it decades later; for I had all but forgotten a brief born again period from my childhood, before the evangelical atheism of my adolescence set in. It was a time when I carried a Gideon pocket New Testament around with me, wherever I went, with the intent of memorizing the whole thing, like a good
        <em>
         madrasah
        </em>
        pupil. (Alas, the New Testament is longer than the Koran, and less rhythmic.)

       <p>
        The astronauts in my story, after a ten-year voyage, including fly-pasts of planets known to be uninhabited, found a whole civilization in this unlikely place. They were welcomed, cautiously, upon landing among the Plutonians; but had little initial success in conversing with these intelligent creatures, who stood less than a cubit high, and had skins so thick they seemed to be in spacesuits themselves, under their woolly garments; gills for ears, tiny mouths like nostrils, the swivelling eyes of chameleons; relating with each other apparently by eye contact alone. There were birds, too, smaller than our hummingbirds, but with long thin tapering wings; and the strangest array of moss-sized plants and sparkling tiny flowers, what looked like bonsai trees, and grains no taller than unmowed lawn grass  growing about a little town in neatly-kept fields, and waving gently in the thin atmosphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        Into this small, walled community all went, Plutonians leading, and our Earthling giants following  slowly and carefully climbing over the gates, and choosing only the widest boulevards to avoid damaging the diminutive habitations. Bowls the size of shot glasses were being filled with a Plutonian wine, to offer our visitors. Prelates in gorgeous gowns were striding forward on what resembled miniature camels, and silent anxious crowds were emerging from the houses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The astronauts moved compulsively towards the largest building, at the centre of this compact metropolis. It was almost Romanesque in design, and had three stone towers, standing one hundred feet high. At the top of each they noticed a Cross. The story concluded with a line one astronaut spoke to another:
       </p>
       <p>
        Hes been here, too!

        In my view, and that of my colleagues up here in the High Doganate  the finches,
        <em>
         &amp;c
        </em>
        (Ive made clear to them that their continued supply of sunflower seeds depends entirely on their agreement with my political and theological opinions)  there is simply no nutrition to be had from the mass media. Let us take Ecuador for example.
       </p>
       <p>
        A friend forwarded two links from that virtual country. One item was the text of Pope Franciss address to a very large rally (a million people), on the subject of the family, turning on a reading from the marriage at Cana, and upon his insistence with Mother Mary that, in defiance of general expectation, the best wine is yet to come. It was a marvellous homily  exactly what a pope or any priest should say, free of heresy and striking a beautiful balance between the mundane and the mystical. The other item was the report on it from the news network, CNN.
       </p>
       <p>
        This latter bore no resemblance to what was said. It was full of the journalists own semi-demented views on the evolution of family life, and his hallucination that the pope secretly agrees with him. The headline, Pope says families need a miracle, hints at scandalous changes for the church, gives a fair summary. A journalist with any idea of Bergoglios previous remarks on this evolution  total opposition to it  could not have written anything so perverse and silly. For in this case, as in all others, the pope was defending the traditional family (mommy, daddy, children and so forth) against the modern world:
       </p>
       <p>
        The family is the nearest hospital; when a family member is ill, it is in the home that they are cared for as long as possible. The family is the first school for the young, the best home for the elderly. The family constitutes the best social capital. It cannot be replaced by other institutions. It needs to be helped and strengthened.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not, however, under the impression that the news article does much harm. The disorientation comes from the multiplication of such articles, and other forms of ignorant and often malicious reportage, and every other kind of callow entertainment, on every conceivable topic; and the fact that, from a very early age, the children of each family are exposed to this poisonous sludge for more hours than they will ever be exposed to their mother and/or father and/or any other guide. This produces in turn, by adolescence at the latest, minds full of poisonous sludge, and contributes thereby to the collapse of civilization.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let it be said that the solution to this problem is not for the Church to change with the times. Surrender to evil is not a solution. The Church wars against the dark forces contriving to dissolve the traditional family, and by the instruction of Christ, there can be no surrender. Let it further be said that for all his reckless indulgence in the extempore, the pope does actually get this, and has expressed it repeatedly, with wheels on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, the great evil of proposals to tinker at the edges of Church doctrine, in family synods and the like, may not come from any single conference or sound bite. Such proposals will be finally shot down. They instead come from the distraction they offer to the main battle, in which we must somehow restore and uphold that family in its normative, integral, timeless, sanctified, and thus traditional form. Even Cardinal Kasper will give beak service to this.

        Margarine (or, oleo as I prefer to call it, from its traditional use in the white trash cookery of the American South) is a succedaneum for butter. Coffee, for some, is a succedaneum for tea, and vice versa for others. You could call it a cheap substitute, but then people would understand, and you would miss the pleasure of being wilfully obscure; whereas only the closet etymologists among my gentle readers will immediately discern that the word is derived from the Latin
        <em>
         succedaneus

I regret this Idlepost threatens to halve its exclusivity. The idea that the author, Ralph Ancil, was pulling legs, occurred to me. But on closer examination I see that he does not have to: for he is president of the Roepke Institute, at Geneva College, in Beaver Falls. Attentive readers of this Idleblog will already know my opinion of the economist Wilhelm Roepke. (Positive.) One might describe him as the reason Germany had so much money to lend Greece.
       </p>
       <p>
        (In passing to my Greek critics: the article by Thomas Piketty that is making the rounds, because he says Germany itself benefited from a huge bailout after the Second World War, is like most everything else that French economist writes: extremely misleading. By a succadaneum of apples for oranges, he lies. The Allies wrote off Germanys debts from the First World War, after the Second one, in 1953. They could do that because the assets corresponding to the debt had meanwhile melted down, from war and hyperinflation. Germanys then-current debts were retained, on more favourable terms, such as the bankers had already offered Greece. When the euro becomes worthless, yes the bankers can wipe out the Greek debt as a nuisance to bookkeeping. But for the moment, that euro is not worthless, or people wouldnt be queueing for small samples of it at the cash machines.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, back to Perfesser Ancil. He identifies, or if you will, names, succadaneanism for a dangerous ideology, aimed like all the Devils other works at the deconstruction of morals and society. His (Ancils, not the Devils) primary example is the substitution of virtual things, for things. It is an historic glide. One might say it began in the Industrial Revolution, when the old monkish (and universal) notion of
        <em>
         laborare est orare
        </em>
        (to work is to pray) was replaced with the new notion of the interchangeable factory worker, who makes a product separated from himself, who does work that is demeaning, on a production line, and only for money, which he looks forward to spending on the weekend when he is free of his crummy job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Things cease to be particular and become commodities. The commodities evolve into virtualities. The humans evolve into commodities themselves  into statistics  and at the frontiers of our scientistic technology, we also become virtual things.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or in a phrase, reality is being systematically replaced by abstractions in our information age. In the article I recommend, the implications of this are sketched out to the meaning of work, the nature of consumption, the understanding of land and community, the use of money, and the destruction of every simple and comprehensible definition in economic thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ideology of succedaneanism disintegrates man morally, psychically, physically, and economically, all in a veritable orgy of impiety with impunity. This is not surprising since long ago, the most bald expression of succedaneanism was the substitution of vice for virtue. Only by keeping a vision of the principles of a humane economy rigorously in mind can we be saved from this tragedy of succedaneanism.

        By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
       </p>
       <p>
        Jesus was something of an aggie, and this is one of his farming metaphors, keyed to conditions in the Palestine of His ministry, but easily understood anywhere else that botany is experienced. On the surface, rather, it is easy to understand; but then it goes deeper. That He meant it to be read both ways  as both piety and doctrine  is clinched within the Sermon on the Mount, where He repeats the phrase and now adds that not everyone who saith Lord to Him will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but only those who have done the will of the Father.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thy will be done, is perhaps the most aggressive phrase in the Lords Prayer. On earth as it is in heaven. As one of the Scotch genetic persuasion, a people of the thistle, I like sometimes to pronounce it in a Scottish brogue. The Calvinists and Catholics of those Highlands and Islands shared in that Gaelic brogue: the sense that some things
        <em>
         need doing
        </em>
        ; or even that they cannot be put off. They may not have got which things need doing always right, however.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the East, John Chrysostom took the view that the fruits were piety. Dont listen to a man who speaks pretty, but is living an ugly life. In the West, Augustine of Hippo thought the fruits more doctrinal. If what the man prettily speaks is not in accord with Christs teaching, it is wrong and pay no attention to him. I have oversimplified both views. Both are right, and there is plenty more meaning, that tends to surface on unexpected occasions, when in my experience
        <em>
         both
        </em>
        propositions are engaged. The man lives an ugly life; he speaks pretty, but it is not what anyone could reasonably call, orthodox.
       </p>
       <p>
        And contrary to the currently received view, there is seldom any subtlety in it. The man makes the fact he is a blackguard dead obvious to those with eyes and ears. Each failing points to the other, and the first observed perversion hints at many more. I am (or, we are) left with no excuse for being seduced by yet another false prophet.
       </p>
       <p>
        No names here, since I am actually trying not to be invidious. Not even the names of politicians, who are right out there in the public eye and, as it were, asking for judgement; many come to mind. Gentle reader will anyway have an idea, to what kind of Pharisees Christ was referring.
       </p>
       <p>
        That we should avoid eating thorns and thistles, I take as generally accepted. The knowledge is likely to be recovered, if lost. Grapes and figs taste considerably better, and are easier to swallow and digest. But as the adage was metaphorical, I will further take it that the question of digestion is cast very large. In reflecting upon the charismatic politician and his message one must ask, not him but oneself: How does this sit with me? What do I think of this man who presents himself as some kind of prophet, or guide, demanding my support for his mission? Why should I believe anything he says? Why should I trust this keeper with my freedom?
       </p>
       <p>
        And perhaps he cannot be stopped; but as I pleaded yesterday, the world is as it is. The trick for a person who takes responsibility, is to reduce himself to an accountable minority of one. (Accountable to Whom? one might ask. Question answered by the cap.) It may be up to ones enemies to decide what will be done with you, if you are in their way when they get power. But it is also up to God, what will be done with those enemies, in the fullness of time, and beyond it. One hardly wants to get in His way.
       </p>
       <p>
        We only strive down here; we never achieve anything. For there is nothing we do here that will not be washed away in the same temporal medium. The striving, as we know from Christ, directly if we are listening, is to holiness and salvation before all other things  but this in turn requires an attitude to neighbours as well as to Our Lord.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is conventional, for politicians upon winning elections, to declare that they are humbled by the experience. There you see a fruit.
       </p>
       <p>
        No one who felt genuinely humbled would say this. He might show it, quite subtly perhaps, in how he behaved; it does not and cannot go into words, without becoming boastful. I use this example with something approaching warmth, for I have developed an allergy or aversion  a rash of the sort that comes from passing through brambles  when men in public positions make a show of their humility. It is invariably pharisaic; it is a warning that one is dealing with profound arrogance, and a vanity that is out of control. He speaks with crowds, but cannot keep his virtue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Democracy encourages almost every vice  using the word in its broadest modern sense, which includes a certain notion of freedom from the restraints of ancient law. It associates the public good with visible public achievements  which I will take in the heraldic sense, of full display: crest, torse, mantling, helm, coronet, supporters; motto and badge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet every good thing I have ever seen done in politics, was achieved quietly, and I think invariably by a man or woman who was not seeking credit for the act. This happens. Good things happen, as well as bad. Indeed: it is amazing what can be accomplished, even in politics, by the person who does not seek the credit, but wills the good end for itself. This is genuine humility.
       </p>
       <p>
        With it goes a frankly mediaeval judgement of what politics are for. They are to accommodate the citizen, in his divine calling, whatever that may be, for the callings are as various as the people. It is, at the minimum, to avoid hindering him, in doing what is right, good, beautiful and salvific.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that requires some judgement in turn, of what a divine calling might be; and genuine humility in the practice and presence of Our Lord to see it clearly. One must, as my father used to put it, Go with God, and as I would add, by the Light that God has given.

        Up here in the High Doganate, we are discussing whether we should vote no to austerity. The Germans havent sent us any money. (Well, there was one who sent us 50$, but that was months ago.) Were wondering if a Greek-style Big Fat No might open their hearts and purses. Im sure they love us (me, purple finches, some other birds up here) as much as they love the Greeks; maybe more.
       </p>
       <p>
        So there,  weve just voted. Me, and after some rhetoric, the finches,  who are parading in celebration on the balconata as I write, like the people in the
        <em>
         Plateia Syntagmatos
        </em>
        . For after I explained the matter to them, they voted eleven no, to seven yes. (The rest ate their ballots.) And when the banks finally reopen,
        <em>
         hooo
        </em>
        are we going to live!
       </p>
       <p>
        The idea that you are broke, and vote for no more austerity, is so democratic. No to austerity; no to paying debts; and no to the rich not giving us more money. I hope you Germans hear that:
        <em>
         No, No, No!
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Shades of Arab Spring; shades of Orange Revolution; shades of Venezuela. I have noticed, everything that gets the crowds out in political euphoria, ends badly. (Not almost everything. Everything.)
       </p>
       <p>
        As ever, I think of all the people out, across Europe, on all the constitution squares, one hundred and one years ago, demanding that their governments get tough with all the other governments. Democracy truly spoke, in the spring and summer of 1914. Seventeen million dead, after all the euphoria. It was not the largest death toll, even to that point in human history. Millions more died in the Taiping Revolt in China, which had ended fifty years before. (That was Chinas first essay in popular democracy.) And more, far more, would die in later conflicts.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is now fifteen years since a socialist government in Greece fudged the national accounts to get into the euro in the first place. And that was on the tail of twenty years other fiscal games for subsidies from the EU. It wasnt just a little lie: some of their numbers were (knowingly) off by an order of magnitude. It is a tiresome business to look back over: lie heaped on lie. And all these men in suits, too polite to call one; too fearful of the mob.
       </p>
       <p>
        The party that now rules Greece,
        <em>
         Syriza
        </em>
        (an acronym from the merger of all the battiest, most demonic leftwing parties), has done a remarkable job of splitting the country, in just five months. Youre either with them or against them; they wont leave you alone. They have every intention of nationalizing everything, and all of their assurances are worthless. The resemblance between Athens and Caracas has emerged: in Tsipras the Greeks have elected another Chavez; another
        <em>
         <span class="st">
          Rattenfnger von Hameln
         </span>
        </em>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I think all democracies end that way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honour, and honesty, are personal things, as all the other virtues; a person may have or lack them. Persons may be individually held to account, for what they have done; for the lies they have told. But this is not so for the collective  be it mob, or nation, or corporation. Collective responsibility means no responsibility at all. The best we can do is stand back from the mob: not bind ourselves to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there is nothing to be troubled about. The world is as it is, and not different.

        Vote No, Hellenes: lets see what happens next. Alternatively, vote Yes: ditto. Either way, their whole country is still bankrupt on Monday morning. I, for one, do not regret the damage they are doing to the euro, the European Union, and various public and private sector banks, quite as much as Christian charity might demand of me. There are people who work in the banks and the bureaucracies whose pain one might feel; European taxpayers stuck with the drubbing; and quite apart from them, the fact that at least some people may have lost honestly-earned life savings  is underappreciated. But this sort of thing happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        So far as I am aware, no freely-elected government, in the history of the world, has survived the combination of cutting services while increasing taxes on a large scale (absent the prosecution of a world war, but then there is usually no election). This is what their creditors have for some time been asking Greek governments to do. I am able to understand why each of those governments has hesitated to obey. Mr Tsipras, the current prime minister, may be a Marxist loon, but his behaviour in this context is not inexplicable.
       </p>
       <p>
        The contrary policy has often been attempted, however, and it is a demonstrated vote winner. Let us all join together and live beyond our means, might as well be an election slogan. Those with moral stamina may reject this, and vote instead for the mean, tightwad, compassionless rightwing party, but a majority of those without this stamina can be patiently assembled for the Left.
       </p>
       <p>
        One recalls Theodoros Pangalos  grandson of a frightful military dictator of the same name and Albanian origin, former Greek deputy prime minister, leading light in the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, and begetter of many generous welfare schemes. He once explained how it was that all the money Europeans had invested in Greece since 1981 had disappeared, having apparently been used for purposes other than those agreed with the lenders.
       </p>
       <p>
        We ate it together, he said. Adding that, There are no honest Greeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the opponent of every political principle I subscribe to, but one honest man. I wanted to give him an award for candour.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the same spirit, and on the assumption that all of its members are glued to my Idleblog, I should like to proffer my advice to the current regime. Dont waste any more time on divisive referenda. Simply remind your creditors how things are. May I suggest:
       </p>
       <p>
        Its true we owe you the money, but quite frankly, we cant pay. We couldnt even put a 1.6 billion instalment together, while asking for another 50 billion plus real quick, so take it from there. Im sure you understand the situation as well as we do. So lets cut to the chase. Were not going to pay, and if you have any brains you are not going to lend us another euro. If on the other hand you dont have the requisite intelligence, please give us another trillion or so, over the next twenty years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bankers could then get busy writing off the debt in its totality; and negotiating with the re-invigorated finance ministers of Italy, Spain, and Portugal. And meanwhile the Greeks could apply themselves to their own next choice  between rebuilding an economy that has taken a hit, as if a war had passed over; or indulging in the kind of hyper-inflation that will eviscerate all economic enterprise, and lead inevitably to bloodshed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would recommend the former, but it is up to them. I would propose some Churchillian call, to summon all resources of grit, skill, faith and prayer; or better yet the Adenauer call, to do again what Germany did in the late 1940s: stable currency, enforced rule of minimal laws, no social programmes, very low taxes to compensate, and every man for himself and his family. (Including his extended family.) Make Greece the beacon for a new Europe, that works on the principles of the old Europe  which worked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Start, if you will, with a silver-standard Attic drachma (4.3 grammes), minted with an owl on the reverse, divided into six little button-like obols. Add didrachms and tetradrachms as demand revives, and eventually minas and perhaps even talents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, if they are truly hungry, we could send them food packages
        <em>
         gratis
        </em>
        , with notes full of love and encouragement, forgetting their trespasses, as they forget ours.

        By way of postscript, let me add that Ive been glancing towards the Greek Orthodox this last week, to see what their priests and hierarchy are making of events. And Ive been quite impressed: they act as if no one has heard about any referendum. We need heroism like that in Rome.

        Todays household hint will be on computers. Nearly half my life (almost thirty years) I have been in possession of, or been possessed by one. It began with Apples in the old
        <em>
         Idler
        </em>
        office; it is true that I approved the purchase. By 1987 they were a necessity to get a magazine out. Later they were a necessity to keep any job in journalism. Let us fly over details, in a great leap forward to 4th December 1999, the day my elder Wee Tiny Boy (then age thirteen) finally persuaded me that I must have email, too, and access to something I had heard about, which was called the Internet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hed already been on them for years. People needing to reach me would send an email to my little boy, hed print it out and walk it down to my office. Often the delivery was made with a droll remark, such as, You know, dad, the problem with
        <em>
         your
        </em>
        generation is that you cant spell. (He then explained how spellcheck was so irritating that one learnt to spell correctly in order to avoid having misspelt words flagged.)
       </p>
       <p>
        My first experience of
        <em>
         that
        </em>
        was in a newspaper column I filed, which mentioned the sayings of a certain ancient Chinese philosopher. In print, it came back to me as,
        <em>
         The Analects of Confusion
        </em>
        . The subeditor in Ottawa told me he had tried to override that twice, but ultimately the machine won.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Germany, I read (on the Internet) that a factory robot has murdered a human co-worker. Mistook him for a machine part, or whatever. Ah, progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        I forgot: even before those
        <em>
         Idler
        </em>
        Apples, I had brief experience of an IBM PC. It was very ugly, and the type on the screen was an eerily backlit putrid green, on an interstellar black ground. I hated it quite a lot. The Apples were at least prettier, but harder for me to comprehend. I wrote a short note on this in the
        <em>
         Idler
        </em>
        . It was a gender issue, or so it seemed to me. The IBM was essentially masculine. It asked you questions to which the answer could be either yes or no. By contrast, the Apple asked more feminine questions, then responded when you tried to answer with the cybernetic equivalent of getting warmer or getting colder. You had to have a relationship with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thing was networked, as well, to a couple of other harmless-looking Apples in the office, that could conspire against you. Fortunately we had a hip young gentleman to deal with them. Eric, as he called himself, came from Montreal, where he was used to trouble, and faced every indication of the worlds impending collapse with an almost obnoxious serenity. He rigged the system to prevent common user errors. For instance, if you tried to delete a document, a little rectangle would appear saying, Do you really want to do that? You hit yes, and got another one: Do you really, really want to do that? You hit yes, and the final one said: Well, you cant.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remembered him this week when my laptop informed me that I had had something called an Adobe crash. My first thought was, Wheres Eric? But then I realized I hadnt seen him for more than twenty years. No doubt he is now wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice.
       </p>
       <p>
        On further thought, I realized that something wonderful had happened, perhaps the answer to my prayers. Two computer programs had been warring in the innards of my laptop; the bigger had just won. It was now preventing the smaller from functioning. And the smaller program was necessary to play any kind of moving picture. None of those provoking ads would now display, with their soundtracks set to max volume; indeed, nothing that moved on my screen would work, including any kind of video, wanted or not. But nothing that held still was affected. There was a slight downside, in that I could no longer play the latest Chant performances on YouTube, or call up last nights Bill OReilly rant on Fox News. But hey, I have plenty of CDs; and I always knew what Bill was going to say.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not sure how to advise gentle reader on reproducing this little miracle in his own machine. I think you just pray, informally: God, these pop-up advertisements are driving me nuts. And then one of His computer angels comes and fixes it for you. But as Ive mentioned before in this space, we cannot expect miracles to be reproducible.
       </p>
       <p>
        I shall take this up with my computer-wizard son when next he calls. I think theres a million to be made here, marketing a specialized program that nixes anything that moves.

        Before starting my daily rant, let me link the two responses to last weeks gay marriage ruling of the United States Supreme Court I found most cogent  those of Fr James Schall (
        <a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3996/on_courtimposed_liberty.aspx">
         here
        </a>
        ), and Dr Ed Peters (
        <a href="https://canonlawblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/antonin-scalia-as-the-measure-of-how-far-we-have-to-go/">
         here
        </a>
        ). The first is a remarkable
        <em>
         tour-de-force
        </em>
        by one of the finest minds in the Church, still with us; the two together will provide any gentle reader, Catholic or not, with some insight into the heritage of Western legal thinking. Print out in plain typography if you can, in both cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Natural law is not some theory, analogous to the latest fashion from France, but has been through the centuries the foundation of our legal, and by extension political, reasoning  in Holy Church, and by extension throughout the civilization she engendered. To be unfamiliar with it is to be inadequately trained, as a lawyer or politician dealing with any moral question. For even if this heritage is rejected, the grounds on which it is rejected must be clarified, and the question must be answered: If that is not your authority, what is?
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been the counter-heritage of modernity (from, say, Descartes), and then post-modernity (from, say, Rousseau), to reject, without decently confuting, that deeper heritage. By this I mean that the modern refuses even to examine, let alone engage with it. He has the curious confidence that he can wing it on his own, that he can conjure his principles from thin air, without any need to make them consistent with the principles he has previously conjured. Finally, today, as we read in Justice Kennedys majority opinion (backed by four nullities who were only there to vote), he can base his decisions only on emotion, on nice feelings without reference to any legal code or jurisprudential principles whatever.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is bad, but in a sense the dissenting opinions were worse. They may show a logical understanding of what the statutes were, and complain that they have been ignored, but they cannot penetrate to the foundations of those statutes. All the legal traditions of the West are thus reduced to a matter of opinion and the passing fad, the opposition to which is purely negative. A credible opposition proposes a positive instead: an alternative understanding of how things
        <em>
         are
        </em>
        , to stand against how things arent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A third link might be to Prof Edward Feser (
        <a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.ca/2015/06/marriage-and-matrix.html">
         here
        </a>
        ), who presents the situation in popular terms, by reference to a science fiction movie. We are dealing not with a revolutionary party, but with an establishment that constitutes a closed camp; an establishment that, in an official and officious way, absolutely denies the existence of any coherent reality, beyond what they make up themselves on the fly. (He chose
        <em>
         The Matrix
        </em>
        ; I would have reached a little farther back to
        <em>
         Blade Runner
        </em>
        for a more subtle prophetic account of the world that lies before us, wherein a long forgotten fixed moral order has been replaced by dubious memories of love.)
       </p>
       <p>
        To my mind, the greatest service the Catholic Church could provide in the present chaos (with the help of other Christians who aspire to orthodoxy) is to resume her ancient educational mission. We cannot debate with the
        <em>
         Zeitgeist
        </em>
        when we do not know with any assurance where we ourselves stand  what we believe, and what are the reasons for our beliefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a task which cannot, by its nature, be performed through extempore tweets and sound bites. Even if reasonable, or true in themselves, these mean nothing if they are not effectively grounded and qualified. The mass media, and the social media, are not in their nature our allies. We may use them to clash, but they are nearly useless for fundamental instruction. In raising children, it is important that these sources of information be unplugged: for we need their whole attention. The connexions we must restore are with reality itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, our Church is in a very bad way, and being led farther astray. Her primary method of teaching has always been through the Mass, the liturgy  learning by doing  and this was systematically sabotaged in the spirit of Vatican II. Her catechetic instruction is in bad hands: overwhelmingly, people who do not themselves know what they are teaching, and are often bad examples of personal formation. But thanks to God for such documents as the
        <em>
         Catechism of the Catholic Church
        </em>
        , and the great wealth of historical materials to which it points in footnotes and internal references, the structure or skeleton of the teaching still holds. Too, the Old Mass is returning.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our opposition has missiles, we fight hand-to-hand. This is the hard truth of the present situation, in which glib media shower their filth 24/7. Parents have little time with their children under present economic arrangements, when both (if there are as many as two) are off working in environments unrelated to them, or seeking light entertainment themselves, in exhaustion from their jobs. Meanwhile the children are exposed to that filth, on average for six or seven hours per day in North America, according to the last study I saw. And this is supplemented in most cases by more hours of secular schooling, in which they are also taught the interests and attitudes which the Internet embodies for them. They are thus raised as consumers of cheap goods and opinions, the very possibility of coherent thought undermined by ever shorter attention spans.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this is just where faith comes in: for reality does not change when it is misrepresented. Humans, for instance, remain male or female, children are procreated by one of each  such truths do not go away, when subverted. They will remain true even when the devils in human flesh breed children by incubator: still it will be seed and egg, beyond their comprehension. Good and evil do not change by human re-definition; and neither does the
        <em>
         fact
        </em>
        of Jesus Christ, by now too well implanted in the knowledge of the world to be expunged from it entirely. He is a fact congruent with everything else we can know about the nature of things, the shape of reality, the inward and outward coherence of a universe not of our making, and of life on Planet Earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The task is to teach not how things should be, but how things
        <em>
         are
        </em>
        . In this we are bound to find divine assistance.
