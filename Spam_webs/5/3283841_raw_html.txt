          Bharat Mata, aka Mother India, is home to over 1.2 billion people, with such diversity that is impossible to cover them all. It has a range of
languages with every community having their own, theyre not even dialects..they have different meanings to words yet they are all united by the
tongue of Hindi. Its thought that the country has 347 spoken languages. Colours splash on the streets daily, devotees parade down celebrating
festivals and there is never a moment where you would be sitting idly. Yet go outside and you can find landscapes ranging from jungles to deserts to
mountain regions. It has culture, it has history and it has stupendous beauty.

          India was a thriving country and had it not been for the British invasion, I think it would have been one of the most powerful countries already.
However, what is rather odd about India are the mysteries surrounding it. What I am to do in this thread is bring just some of them to your eyes,
which youve probably already met and try to show you that India is just not a country where poverty is seen but its rich domain where jewels can
be found in the oddest of places.

ask. My thread is just one view, the fact is, there isnt one right view when we come to talking about the scriptures so there are many

          Before we get onto the real cover-up, Id like to give a brief overview to just some of the amazing literature Indias history holds. Many think
Hinduism is one of the oldest living religions to still exist.  There are elements from it which were part of the religion from the Indus Civilisation
which abruptly vanished. Moreover, we have Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism that are closely related to it. Its scriptures are the basis of India and
Nepals main religion; Hinduism. To me, Hinduism is rather strange compared to other religions. There is no single founder, there is no single set
of teachings and there is no single set of teachings which people HAVE to adhere to.  For example, you cannot find The Ten Commandments like in
Christianity...our religion is just based on stories, our interpretation of them and thats one of the reasons what makes Hinduism so unique. Key
figures teach different philosophies and many consider the sacred scriptures to be a way of life or a family of religions rather than a
single religion.

            Shruti Literature
           </span>
          </u>
          <br/>
          The Vedas are part of the Shruti literature which contain revelations, which can be translated to which is heard. Many consider the Vedas to be
divine in origin and not made by humans. Its thought that they were composed in the early stages of civilisation, passed down in generations and
written around 1500BC. They are thought to be nitya (eternal) and apauruseya (our of this world.) Many Hindus believe in something similar to animism
for example, the words written in the Vedas are Brahma Dev himself.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The word Veda means wisdom, knowledge. They are the oldest and most authoritative scriptures of Hinduism. Hindus believe that they werent
composed by anyone but revealed to Rishis. The Vedas consist of:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          1) Rigveda (written before the Aryans settled in India)
          <br/>
          2) Yajurveda
          <br/>
          3) Samaveda
          <br/>
          4) Atharvaveda
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Each of these are then made up of 4 divisions which are separated into:
          <br/>
          -
          <i>
           Samhita
          </i>
           hymns
          <br/>
          -
          <i>
           Brahmana
          </i>
           rituals and moral principles
          <br/>
          -
          <i>
           Aryanyaka
          </i>
           meditations
          <br/>
          -
          <i>
           Upanishads
          </i>
           records of transcendental experiences
          <br/>
          <br/>
          They all address not only the divine gods and goddesses but spiritual entities that exist in our awareness and awake as we progress through the
various stages of advancement for Self Realisation. Looking deeper, one can see the descent of specific energies/forces descending into our
consciousness from higher worlds.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The truths and principles from the Upanishads were all brought together in the form of sutras. These are known as the Brahma Sutras and form the
basis of the philosophy system, also known as Vedanta Darshana. To read more about the Vedantas:

          The 4 parts of the Vedas have significance to the four ashramas of life, the 4 stages of life.

          </u>
          <br/>
          Compared to the revelations as written above, the Smriti literature is a product of human intellect where the information is based upon the Vedas and
their interpretations of it. Yes, there are law books such as the Dharma Shastras which are of 4. Manusmriti is the most popular which is like a
guidebook to human conduct, social and religious behaviour. In many of the Dharma Shastras there are rules on groups of individuals such as castes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Yes, there have been a lot of criticism to it; the caste system, the status of women which is definitely narrow minded, please remember  that this
doesnt have the same status as the Vedas and is written by humans....this all came as a by-product of them and their political and social
circumstances. These books do not have to be necessarily accepted as final authority on any issue...unlike the Vedas they are not eternal or fallible.
There is no caste system in the Vedas nor discrimination between man and women.

          Itihasa means history. The Mahbharata and Ramayana are included in this category, which have some very interesting occurrences which I hope to talk
about later on in the thread. Another is the well known Bhagavad Gita.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Mahabharata is the story of Pandavas and Kauravas and greed for the political power which led to massive war and destruction of both families, leaving
the Pandavas winning only probably because Krishna Bagwaan gave his support to them. It is indeed difficult to read this without coming to terms with
the destructive nature of mankind and the dangers of us. The BG describes the message of Krishna Bagwaan to Arjuna on the battlefield in the
Mahabharata. However, its not just to him but to entire humanity describing words of wisdom to help not only with external battles but battles
internally as well. Theres a lot of spiritual truth within it. The Ramayana is the story of Rama and his battle against the demons by Ravana. He
abducts Sita and it tells the tale of the rescue her and a quite unique twist at the end.

          These describe the religious events that happened in the past. They deal with the numerous incarnations of God and the deeds done by them. While the
above epics deal with what happened on earth in the past, the Puranas just dont deal with Gods on earth but on their different planes. There is
their own Vedic conception of time which we separate out into 4 stages and we are thought to be in the fourth stage.  What is written below is found
in the Puranas which is considered to be the fifth Veda.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          1) Satya-Yuga: 1,728,000 human years
          <br/>
          2) Treta-Yuga: 1,296,000 human years
          <br/>
          3) Dvapara-Yuga: 864,000 human years
          <br/>
          4) Kali-Yuga: 432,000 human years
          <br/>

          <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas" target="_blank">
           Puranas
          </a>
          describe the above four stages. The first one is thought to be the Golden Age. There
is no such thing as hate nor envy, no such thing as fear....just wisdom and virtue dominate this era. People in this age live for around 100,000
years. The second stage is where the good qualities reduce by a third (though others may say a quarter.) Sacrifices are introduced with people
desiring goods, wanting to be rewarded for work. They live now for a maximum for 10,000 years. In the third stage, its good qualities are only a half
of what it was in the Treta-Yuga. The Vedas are divided into 4 parts and a minority study them. Sensual desires, diseases and injustice begin to
spread and people here live to a maximum of 1000 years. Lastly, we come to the Iron Age, where men are short lived and have less intelligence. The
maximum duration is 100 years of human life. Humans are now misled, disturbed and morals and principles are literally not to be seen.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Whats interesting is that as the number of good qualities decrease, the lifespan of the humans decrease. And well, we do rarely live to the age of
100 which have been predicted by scriptures that are written thousands and thousands of years ago.

          History is most often written with an agenda. Early indologists wished to control and convert the followers of Vedic cultures, therefore spreading the
word that the Vedas were simply mythology. Lets take Max Muller for example. He initially wrote that the Vedas were worse than savage and
that India must be conquered again by education. He went on to say that the religion there is doomed although later on glorified the Vedas.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          It was these Indologists that devised the Aryan Invasion Theory who many believe intentionally misinterpreted the Sanskrit language to make the Vedas
look primitive. It is no secret that the British who invaded India, tried to make India feel ashamed of their own culture, thus indicating that
perhaps these men were motivated by a racial bias. Nowadays, the Aryan Invasion Theory is under scrutiny. Did it actually occur? Nope. No evidence
that it actually did occur. The Vedic culture is thought to have derived from foreign soil according to the Aryan invasion yet there are NO FINDINGS
that can be associated with Aryan people coming to India.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          Nowhere in the Vedas is there a single mention of an Aryan homeland outside of India, yet the Saraswati River where two thirds of the 2,500 Indus
sites were found, was. Now the Aryans are thought to have arrived AFTER the Saraswati River dried up. Why would a desolated river be mentioned over 50
times in the Rig Veda if there was no use for the river? Why would the Aryans even write about it? The way the Saraswati River is described in the
Vedas indicate that it was written pre-Aryan.

          <br/>
          <p align="center">
           There is no genetic, cultural, archaeological substantial evidence proving that there was an invasion.  It is all just theory and yet

          Max Muller is the main guy who actually proposed the Aryan Invasion. Now...anyone seeing what Im seeing? Is anyone already seeing the manipulation
Im seeing? This guy believed in the Biblical chronology. He placed the world at 400BC and the flood approximately 2500BC and therefore randomly
suggested that the Aryans came to India around 1500BC. However he later goes on to contradict himself. He admitted the
          <span class="postBold">
           <u>
            purely speculative nature
of the Vedic chronology yet it appears all of mankind have seemed to turn a blind eye to that.

           Now let us examine the facts about the so-called evidences in support of AIT:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           1. Real Meaning of the Word 'ARYA' In 1853, Max Muller introduced the word 'Arya' into the English and European usage as applying to a racial and
linguistic group when propounding the Aryan Racial theory. However, in 1888, he himself refuted his own theory and wrote:
           <br/>
           <blockquote id="quotebox">
            <i class="icon-quote-left">
            </i>
            <br/>
            I have declared again and again that if I say Aryas, I mean neither blood nor bones, nor hair, nor skull; I mean simply those who speak an
Aryan language...to me an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a
dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar. (Max Muller, Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas, 1888, pg 120) In Vedic
Literature, the word Arya is nowhere defined in connection with either race or language. Instead it refers to: gentleman, good-natured, righteous
person, noble-man, and is often used like 'Sir' or 'Shree' before the name of a person like Aryaputra, Aryakanya, etc.
           </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Actually there is evidence that the scriptures are indigenous to the Indians that occupied the country. For example the linguistic characteristic
between the Indus civilisation and Vedic is so similar. Om symbols can be found, the swastika and many more. Harappan seals have been deciphered
consistently Vedic. Pottery found has written the sacred land which is bounded by the Saraswati River. Again, that river is mentioned in the
Vedas.  Even the practices of some gods from the Indus civilisation were found in the Vedas as well.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Even the word Aryan which means master race seems rather big headed. It shows me an image of people who believe that they are right. Why
would the Aryans who invaded write in a different language that is not their own? And in Sanskrit...a very difficult language? They wouldnt. A
proud race like them would have not bothered trying to learn the new culture or language and tried to rein everything with their own. We should be
seeing a different culture that the Aryans would have brought with them.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          So all in all, here are some major flaws which I mentioned above clearly shown:

            There is no mention of a region outside of India. If indeed the Aryans had taken over, they would have at least spoken about their mighty
victory of capturing the land of India. If Hindu-Aryans were outsiders, why are all the holy places found in India?

            Why talk about the Saraswati river more than 50 times when it dried up by the time of the so called invasion? It had no use. Why praise it?

           </li>
           <li>
            If the Aryans invaded the towns of the Harappa valley and killed the citizens...why did they not take over the towns and live there themselves?

           </li>
           <li>
            There is no genetic, cultural, archaeological substantial evidence proving that there was an invasion.  It is all just theory and yet its still
being taught as a fact today in textbooks, in schools.

          </span>
          <br/>
          There is actually substanstial evidence that the Mahabharata war actually occurred, such as in Kurukshetra, the scene of the Mahabharata war, iron
arrows and spearheads have been excavated and dated by thermoluminence to 2,800 B.C.E., the approximate date of the war given within the Mahabharata
itself. And below Id like to talk about another one.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Dwarka, known as Dvaraka, is one of the cities that are mentioned in the Mahabharata. It was a port city having a lot of trade relations. More
famously it is known famously it is referred to the capital of Krishna Bagwaans capital, which arose from the ocean at his commend and returned
when Krishna Bagwaan no longer walked the earth. The most expensive materials were used for construction, commonly gold, precious stone sand silver. 
This is all learnt from the Mahabharata and we also learn:

           <br/>
           The sea, which had been beating against the shores, suddenly broke the boundary that was imposed on it by nature. The sea rushed into the city.
It coursed through the streets of the beautiful city. The sea covered up everything in the city. I saw the beautiful buildings becoming submerged one
by one. In a matter of a few moments it was all over. The sea had now become as placid as a lake. There was no trace of the city. Dwaraka was just a
name; just a memory.  Arjuna, Mahabharata
          </blockquote>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The search for the lost city was ongoing since the 1930s. The MAU (Marine Archaelogy Unit) of the National Institute of Oceanography took part in this
search in 1983 and yes, it was found. Excavations have been made actually finding this city underwater CORRESPONDING with the Mahabharata. Scary
isnt it? It was discovered between 1983 to 1990, and found to have been built in six sectors along the banks of a river. The foundation of boulders
on which the city's walls were erected proves that the land was reclaimed from the sea. The general layout found agrees with what is found in the
Vedas. Moreover, dating has shown that it appears to have sunk approximately 9500 years ago. This once again, appears to have occurred during the
Mahabharata period.

          One of the main objects that actually further proved that this city was Dwarka was a seal of a three headed animal. In the Vedas, it describes that
this seal was given to the citizens as an identity of proof when the city was being threaded by King Jarasandha. This seal was also found in the ruins
under the ocean.

          Not only does Dwarka collaborate by the words written in the scriptures but the 3 cities that the Pandavas had at the end of the Mahabharata shows
cultural consistency with the events and even images such as on pottery painted of the win. Talking about cities. Let me briefly mention Hastinapur.
In the Vayu Puranas and Matsya, a great flood occurred which destroyed the capital city of Hastinapur. This made the inhabitants move to Kausambi
where archaeological evidence actually has been found and dated back to just after the flood. The soil of Hastinapur also shows proof for the
flooding.

             Ancient Tech - Evidence For A Nuclear War

           </span>
          </span>
          <br/>
          Whats rather odd is that within the ancient scriptures there are continuous mentions of advanced technology from mechanical flying machines to
weapons that seem like our own. Think about it carefully. People from thousands and thousands of years ago could think of weapons that we have
created, think of disasters that have already occurred yet described in detail and people thousands of years ago, who we believe lived primitively had
the ability to think of it? Thats just incredible. The writings so clearly compare to e.g. nuclear wars that we have to question how they could
think that with such remarkable detail and even question if they indeed had the technology for that....If they did, that would mean a big, big change
in all of our thinking today.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A wise man once stated:
          <br/>

          What Einstein said was magnificent., yet give it a moment....what if he was only relating the past? What if humans had to start again, had to fight
again with sticks and stones?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The human race appears to be very arrogant. We consider ourselves as the most superior in all of history and out of all species. Well, I dont think
so. The destruction that we cause is fuelled by our greed and hunger for power. And apparently to people, that seems  to be a perfectly sound reason. 
Yet let us go way way back. I actually believe there was advanced technology in many cultures. If we try to go back in history, wed just come to a
massive gap where we know nothing. Lets look at some ancient technology that appeared in the Hindu scriptures.

          Reading through it, a lot of what is written does appear familiar.  Indeed, when a nuclear blast occurs we see a lengthy column that is emitting light
and smoke. Our food becomes contaminated and deadly to eat...hair falls out....corpses are burned. These are all sure signs of a nuclear blast.
However, most people die from the effects of the nuclear blasts, the radiation and this passage probably describes the actual blast itself.

to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees. Instead of mushroom clouds, the writer describes a perpendicular explosion with its billowing
smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant parasols. There are comments about the contamination of food and people's hair falling out.  Kisari

          <br/>
          Theres a lot of discussion from what Ive seen on ATS and outside about this topic on mysterious weapons found once again in the Mahabharata.
Many people believe its myths but theres an uncanny resemblance once again to what is written in the Vedas. The effects described seem to be
identical to what they actually are.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Near Mohenjo-Daro, excavations were carried out in the early 1900s which led to a large town being discovered. Rather than what it held, scientists
are more intrigued by its death. There is no evidence of a flood; there werent many skeletons nor remnants of weapons nor anything else that showed
there was a war or a natural disaster. From the scientific analysis, the catastrophe had occurred very quickly and unexpectedly. So what actually
caused this?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Davneport and Vincenti are 2 scientists who put forward a theory...that there was a nuclear blast. What they found was stratums of green glass and
clay which causes archaeologists to believe that there were high temperatures that melted the clay and sand and immediately hardened afterwards. These
stratums of green glass can be found in Nevada desert AFTER EVERY nuclear explosion. Researchers believe that the temperature was over 1,500 degrees
centigrade to melt this.  If we look at the walls and foundations of the city, there are literally vitrified; fused together.

          </div>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          There also appeared to be some kind of epicentre. Destruction appears to have lessened towards the outskirts. Loads of skeletons were found in
the area of Mohenjo-Daro which were
          <span class="postBold">
           <u>
            50 times more radioactive than normal
           </u>
          </span>
          which were found by  a Soviet scholar. Whats unsettling is
that many of these skeletons were found all over the place, holding hands and sprawled in the streets. The skeletons are thousands of years old and
there appears to be no cause of physically violent death. They have been dated back to 2500 BC but please remember when atomic explosions are
involved; it makes it seem much younger. Carbon-dating meaurs the amount of radiation left which for this type is rather unreliable.

          If we look at some other cities nearby, in Northern India, many show evidence for explosions of a massive magnitude. In one city between the Ganga and
the Rajmahal mountains, we can find its been subjected to intense heat.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Yet let us go to Rajasthan. This one particularly caught my eye. A heavy layer of ash covers a 3 square mile area. This is around 10 miles west of
Jodhpur. The levels of radiation are so high that the government has now made that region off limits. Scientists have also found a high rate of birth
defects and cancer where a housing development was built. Scientists then apparently unearthed an ancient city where they found evidence of an atomic
blast dating back thousands of years: from 8,000 to 12,000 years. Most of the buildings were destroyed and apparently  a million people.
          <br/>

          Could this possibly be another piece of evidence that the Mahabharatas events occurred?

misconceptions that children are fed and manipulated to believe causing many humans to share the narrow and rigid mind many have. Be open to all the

numerous times that people couldnt do this or that because they just couldnt be clever enough in the past. Whats more, its easy to

          <br/>
          Vimanas are thought to be like UFOs. There are, once again, many mentions of flying aircrafts in the Mahabharata during the battle. In the
Mahabharata, there is an enormous poem where we learn that a guy called Asura Maya had a Vimana, that has 4 wheels and measures 12 cubits in
circumference and the Ramayana describes a Vimana as a double-deck, circular aircraft with portholes and a dome. Furthermore its thought that the
Vimanas were able to be made invisible in some way. When Krishna Bagwaan was pursuing Salva, his Vimana was made invisible in some way. However,
Krishna Bagwaan, it is said, fired off a special weapon, that quickly laid an arrow, which killed by seeking out sound.

           Strong and durable must the body of the Vimana be made, like a great flying bird of light material. Inside one must put the mercury engine with
its iron heating apparatus underneath. By means of the power latent in the mercury which sets the driving whirlwind in motion, a man sitting inside
may travel a great distance in the sky. The movements of the Vimana are such that it can vertically ascend, vertically descend, move slanting forwards
and backwards. With the help of the machines human beings can fly in the air and heavenly beings can come down to earth. The Hakatha (Laws of the
Babylonians) states quite unambiguously: The privilege of operating a flying machine is great. The knowledge of flight is among the most ancient of
our inheritances. A gift from 'those from upon high'. We received it from them as a means of saving many lives.

          Imagine a mechanical study on Apollos Sun Chariot. Well this is what one of the Kings who reigned from 1000-1055AD who went by the name of King
Bhoja of Dhar did. One of his most famous works is an encyclopaedia on Indian architecture the Samarangana Sutradhara as I mentioned above.   This man
went on to talk about the Vimanas, much more than any other Vedic texts. He portrays them as practical machines and nothing celestial about
them. He wrote about them having a mercury engine, possibly it having an internal iron heating apparatus. Whats rather strange is that the
man wrote:

          In 1918, a guy named Subbaraya Shastry fell into a trance where he recited ancient Sanskrit verses. He then went to speak of the Vimanas. Rather than
stories about the gods, he spoke scientifically about them and apparently they were written already by an ancient guy called Bharadvaja. 35 years on,
this text was found and translated into Hindi and published by G.R. Joyser.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          It is called the Vaimanika Shastra. This one goes into a lot of detail compared to the Vedic texts and Bhoja. It has 8 titles, a few being:

           Particularly interesting is a discussion of how flying has changed over time: in the earliest Yuga (epoch), the text claims that people could
fly without the use of vimanas. In other words, Indians invented ancient flying machines only after they lost the ability to fly on their own. The
text goes on to describe a number of specific
           <span class="postBold">
            <u>
             vimana models (complete with fine drawings by a local engineer), serving various purposes; some

           </span>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Finally, the text cites 32 secrets related to construction and operation of vimanas. These include
           <span class="postBold">
            <u>
             anti-gravity, radar, invisibility, the

included are concoctions of animal urine as a source of power as well as a weapon called a marika, which resembles modern laser
technology.

           Proponents of ancient technology theories, for whom the apparently thousands-of-years-old Vaimanika Shastra is a touchstone, point
out that the manuscript references the work of no less than 70 authorities and 10 experts of air travel in antiquity.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When the Vaimanika Shastra was brought before the Indian Institute of Science, the scientists scoffed. As thoroughly as it had been written, the
committee just as thoroughly dismantled the study in an essay called A Critical Study of the Work Vymanika Shastra. They questioned whether the author
(whoever that may have been) had any grasp of basic physics, chemistry and electricity, not to mention the disciplines of aeronautics:
aerodynamics, aeronautical structures, propulsive devices, materials, and metallurgy. Their conclusion: None of the planes has properties or
capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them
resist rather than assist flying.

          Okay, lets suppose there was NO WAY IN HELL trying to fly them....think more about what was written thousands of years ago...radar technology,
anti-gravity, invisibility? Some of this stuff were still experimenting on. Even for them to have the concepts about these would in my opinion,
make them definitely advanced. Much more advanced than we believe them to be.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Why did the Indian Institute of Science went to great lengths to dismiss the Vaimanika Shastra? Why does the Vimanas repeatedly mentioned throughout
history? Moreover, what inspired the writers to believe in and continuously write about these aircrafts?

          Yet we talk about the Vimanas, but apparently theorists claim there to be a previous type of Vimanas. In the Rig Veda, its described as golden

           <br/>
           In the Ramayana (ca. 4th century BC), the Hindu epic poem recounting how Lord Rama rescues his wife Sita from the evil god Ravana, vimana experts cite
the flying chariot called the Pushpaka vimana:

            Self-propelled was that car. It was large and finely painted. It had two stories and many chambers with windows... It gave forth a melodious sound

           <br/>
           Later, the Pushpaka vimana is described as an aerial and excellent chariot going everywhere at will[rising] up into the higher
atmosphere.

          Yet it doesnt even stop there. Theres information in the Chaldean work, The Sifrala which contains over a hundred pages on details on
building the flying machine. It contains words that mean in English; graphite rods, copper coils, crystal indicator, vibrating spheres, stable angles.

           In another amazing Indian text the Agastrya Samhita gives the precise directions for constructing electrical batteries:

           <br/>
           "Place a well-cleaned copper plate in an earthenware vessel.

           Cover it first by copper  sulfate  and  then  moist sawdust.

           <br/>
           chain of one hundred jars is said to give a very active

           <br/>
           <br/>
           By the way,  MITRA-VARUNA is now called cathode-anode, and Pranavayu
           <br/>
           and Udanavayu are to us oxygen and hydrogen. This document again

           It is interesting to note that when Alexander the Great invaded India more than two thousand years ago, his historians chronicled that at one
point they were attacked by "flying,fiery shields" that dove at his army and frightened the cavalry. These "flying saucers" did not use any atomic
bombs or beam weapons on Alexander's army however, perhaps out of benevolence, and Alexander went on to conquer India.

          Apparently (and its a big apparently since I cant find any evidence for this) the Soviet scientists have also found age-old instruments used
in navigating cosmic vehicles in the caves in the Gobi desert and Turkestan. They have a drop of mercury inside and are hemispherical. Could it be
a Vimana?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Of course I dont know how credible this is but if indeed this is true...more evidence to add to quite a substantial pile already.

          And no, it just doesnt stop there with the weapons and technology. Theres loads mentioned in the books. Whats more, its not just one
that has similarities with ours but theres so many. Lets look at the  some of the Astras; weapons:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Agneyastra Brahmastra,Chakram, Garudastra, Kaumodaki, Narayanastra, Pashupata, Shiva Dhanush, Sudarshana Chakra, Trishul, Vaishnavastra, Varunastra,
and Vayavastra.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          These weapons are said to only be able to be used by the Gods. They use the elements to their strength. Out of all these, the Brahmastra is the most
powerful weapon. It can only be used for one person but its absolutely lethal. The first passage that I mentioned in the nuclear war section is
thought to be the effects of this use. It contained the power of the universe and the passage describes nuclear radiation effects....this then could
have probably been the nuclear weapon.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Another weapon that seems similar to what we have today is the missile. In the Mahabharata, we learn that Salva who was flying in an invisible Vimana
was attacked by a special fire weapon that seeked sound and downed the Vimana and killed Salva.
          <br/>

and projected onto some screen. These lens are placed in a special arrangement with crystals, special mirrors and through a combination of solar,
electric and mercury power are projected through some mechanism.

           Their method of propulsion, she said, was anti-gravitational and was based upon a system analogous to that of laghima, the unknown
power of the ego existing in mans physiological makeup, a centrifugal force strong enough to counteract all gravitational pull. According to
Hindu Yogis, it is this laghima which enables a person to levitate.

           Dr. Reyna said that on board these machines, which were called Astras by the text, the ancient Indians could have sent a detachment of men onto
any planet, according to the document, which is thought to be thousands of years old. The manuscripts were also said to reveal the secret of
antima; the cap of invisibility and garima; how to become as heavy as a mountain of lead.

           Naturally, Indian scientists did not take the texts very seriously, but then became more positive about the value of them when the Chinese announced
that they were including certain parts of the data for study in their space program! This was one of the first instances of a government admitting to

          Ive also read on many articles (which appear to be copied and pasted from an original source which I have no idea what it is) that allegedly, there
are secret brotherhoods which are hording the Vimanas and keeping it a secret from us. Those that know about this are thought to be exceptionally
enlightened human beings and keep their knowledge away from us. Thats not surprising at all. I mean, they know wed use it for devastation,
for bad purposes as history time and time shows us. If I knew something that could be potentially used to cause death or such, I wouldnt even utter
a word.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Many writers believe that these Brotherhoods keep the Vimanas in caverns in Tibet or in underground bases. The Lop Nor Desert is meant to be a big UFO
mystery and that could indeed be a place. Again, there is indeed no evidence for this. Just theories. But this theory must have started somewhere and
should have an element of truth. If its correct, its one great hidden secret.
          <br/>

          Slightly deviating Id quickly like to mention the Nine Unknown Men. They are actually probably one of the most famous secret societies
thought to exist. To read more, click here:

          . Skip any
references to Lost and it seems quite believable. The ancient Indians possessed loads of knowledge and I wouldnt be surprised if this was
true. Each of them guarded one book of knowledge...also at this point, Id further like to say that in my family theres one particular legend
that COULD relate to this. Apparently, some Germans came to visit India...and read these books. Legend has it, they stole it and took it with
them...hence the whole engineering phase of Germany and how absolutely amazing it is with its technology.

          Each book had a different branch of this knowledge. The practices of the disciplines talked about are said to cause the destruction of the world. It

           This is the study of the mechanical, physical and biochemical functions of living organisms. It is well known to hold

a secret base in the Himalayas.

          However the thing to be considered is that there are millions of ill, diseased pilgrims. Some with horrific ones. However, they can bathe in there
without

credited also to the bacteriophages that are contained. Im not very good with this part of the topic, however isnt one of the main ways people
gain diseases and so on are through human contact? Surely the pathogens would be carried through the water.

been said that temples and religious organisations receive large quantities of gold. They do not know who gave it from them. The fact that India has a
few gold mines has puzzled many, also due to the large amount of gold given. However, this isnt to say this is true  it could be a made up
rumour to soothe the folks there. Also, we see India as a poor (but rapidly developing) country makes us wonder if there was really gold given to the
country.

one.

          <br/>
          7)
          <span class="postBold">
           COSMOLOGY
          </span>
          - If you believe in UFOs, one of the main queries is how they can travel so fast. In the 7th book, it describes how to travel at
enormous speeds through spacetime fabric  possibly time travel. It seems that intra and inter universal trips are also discussed in this.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In the Indian Puranas, thought to be more than 1200 years old. A speed of the sun is given based on the Rig Veda. That speed is: 2,202 yojanas in half
a nimesa.  These are given in ancient indian units. Here is a conversion:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A yojanas is 8000 Dhanus/bows and each bow is 6 feet
          <br/>
          A nimesa is 16/73 of a second, as deduced from the following in the Purans:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          15 nimesa = 1 Kastha
          <br/>
          30 Kastha = 1 Kala
          <br/>
          30 Kala = 1 Mahutra
          <br/>
          30 Malhutra = 1 day and night
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If we convert them to their equivalent modern units, where each yojanas is 9 miles and each nimesha is 16/73.3 seconds, substituting it into the speed
of the sun by the Rig Veda gives the speed of the sun as 186,536 miles per second which is most definitely not far off.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This means the Rig Veda figure is pretty accurate to the modern figure. This kind of accuracy can only be achieved with laser technology and highly
sophisticated measuring equipment. However, this just corroborates what we already know from the Vymanika Shastra, that they did indeed have laser
technology.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          8)
          <span class="postBold">
           LIGHT
          </span>
          - In this, it describes how to increase and decrease the speeds of light, to use it as a weapon and so on. Recently, weve seen
such things as light being repelled and so on. Maybe well eventually reach this stage? This works quite well with the Darpana Yantras.

          <span class="postBold">
           SOCIOLOGY
          </span>
          - The final books contains rules, laws , predictions, in a way on the evolution of societies and how to predict their downfall.
This probably is one of the key ones  wouldnt anyone want to stop fate (considering if this is actually true)?

          <br/>
          <br/>
          Theres actually no physical, tangible evidence  that some of this is actually true so please bear that in mind. Yet the depth of some of the
writing, or the fact its even mentioned seems bewildering. For example, who would have come up with a nuclear blast? I mean, we didnt even know
what the effects were until actually testing it out and unfortunately that appeared to occur at Japan. We didnt know how bad itd be, or even
what itd look like. The Vimanas as well. Why would they talk about chariots or flying machines? Laser technology? How can one come up with that
with no advanced knowledge?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          What would have sparked that imagination that seems to protrude from the scriptures? Aliens? Or are these actual feats of intelligence? Or is it just
another story contorted as it passed down society?

the planet as well. As I've stated elsewhere I'm not sure the "Ancients" ever reached our level or used our modern type of technology but maybe
something closer to what Tesla was probably working on.

          I think the true and complete history of the Indus valley has yet to be written. I've often wondered where the origins of the Indus valley
civilization came from? I believe the original inhabitants/founders moved North from the coast following the ancient rivers inland away from the
rising oceans during the last of the ice age melt off to settle in all along the ancient river valley. Some of which [as had] already been pointed out
are now presently dry and dead rivers.

           The remains of what has been described as a huge lost city may force historians and archaeologists to radically reconsider their view of ancient
human history. Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres (120 feet) underwater in the Gulf of Cambay off the western coast of
India could be over 9,000 years old. The vast city - which is five miles long and two miles wide - is believed to predate the oldest known remains in
the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years.

          The area in question is off the west coast of India. In this image from Google it would be the light blue area. The theoretical coast line would be at
the farthest extent from the present coast line to the outer edge of the light blue area in this picture.

          I find it rather interesting when we consider that there has been no real evidence of Stone Age tool making in India. Then as it seems out of nowhere
again we have one of the worlds earliest civilizations show up along the Indus valley.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I believe an early Indian stone Age civilization/culture had to move inland as the oceans slowly rose to their present day levels [Due to the last of
the ice age melt off]  and covered up any evidence of early Stone Age development. So when dealing with India's oral tradition and written "Myths"
I say we should give them a bit more fair and balanced scrutiny than many do in the modern world.

           Isolated remains of Homo erectus in Hathnora in the Narmada Valley in Central India indicate that India might have been inhabited since at least
the Middle Pleistocene era, somewhere between 200,000 to 500,000 years ago.[5][6]

           Early Neolithic culture in South Asia is represented by the Mehrgarh findings (7000 BCE onwards) in present day Balochistan, Pakistan. Traces of a
Neolithic culture have been found submerged in the Gulf of Khambat in India, radiocarbon dated to 7500 BCE.[7] The Edakkal Caves has one of the
earliest exmples of stone age writing. Late Neolithic cultures sprang up in the Indus Valley region between 6000 and 2000 BCE and in southern India
between 2800 and 1200 BCE.

          We always hear the saying that in all myths there is a tiny kernel of truth. I remember reading about
          <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Bridge#Controversies" target="_blank">
           Rama's bridge
          </a>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Whether this land bridge is man-made structure or just the top of a low lying mountain ridge that was eventually covered by the rising oceans and
later built upon makes no difference to me. But what is surprising is that they knew about it and it wasn't until NASA was able to show it that the
myths genesis was revealed.

          There is very little concrete proof that Dwarka was actually a part of that civilization. There are very many similarities between the two. But to the
untrained eye so are the similarities between ROME and Greece. However it does prove again what I have been speculating in that Dwarka was a separate
and older location and was submerged before the Harappan showed up pretty much out of nowhere. Again we had "myths" first that were passed down
surrounding its location. Then we had scientific proof later of their existence. Remember there is very little if any evidence of a development stage
like what we see in Egypt.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Yet the Harappan had indoor plumbing, sewage and water storage. The city street layouts were extremely well thought. With detailed infrastructure
supposedly at the earliest point in their existence. Where does one suppose that early development phase took place if not there then where? It had to
have had a development phase and location. So far there have been no big discoveries on land. We do however have a very real possibility of a much
older location just off the coast that does not fly in the face of other sciences about this possibility.

           One of the most fascinating yet mysterious cultures of the ancient world is the Harappan civilization. This culture existed along the Indus River
in present day Pakistan.  It was named after the city of Harappa which it was centered around.  Harappa and the city of Mohenjo-Daro were the greatest
achievements of the Indus valley civilization. These cities are well known for their impressive, organized and regular layout.
           <br/>
           Over one hundred other towns and villages also existed in this region. The Harappan people were literate and used the Dravidian language. Only part of
this language has been deciphered today, leaving numerous questions about this civilization unanswered.

           There are several theories as to the origin of the Indus Valley civilization. The earliest hypothesis was that it was an early form of a Vedic
civilization which would come to dominate most of South Asia, which was presumed to have been characterized by influence from Indo-European
migrations. However, this theory began to be rejected when no signs of the traditional culture associated with the Vedas was uncovered in that of the
Indus Valley. The absence of horses amongst the many realistic representations of animals was also considered significant, considering the importance
of horses and chariots to the culture described in the Vedas. Detailed bone analysis has revealed that the horse itself was introduced to the
subcontinent only at the beginning of the second millennium B.C., which contributes to the chronological problem with this theory.[35][36] Finally,
the concept of urban life which dominates the Indus Valley civilization is foreign to the more rural lifestyle which is described in the Vedas.[37]
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The next theory put forward was that the civilization was of proto-Dravidian origin.[38] This theory was first proposed by researchers from Russia and
Finland who attempted to show that Indus valley symbols could be derived from the Dravidian language group. Today, the Dravidian language family is
concentrated mostly in southern India and northern Sri Lanka, but pockets of it still remain throughout the rest of India and Pakistan (the Brahui
language), which lends credence to the theory. Finnish Indologist Asko Parpola concludes that the uniformity of the Indus inscriptions precludes any
possibility of widely different languages being used, and that an early form of Dravidian language must have been the language of the Indus people.
However, the proto-Dravidian origin theory is far from being confirmed due to an emphasis on linguistic connection while evidence of a broader
cultural connection remains to be found.[37]

          Wasn't trying to get too far off topic but India's long history of oral traditions and fairly old written history is IMHO "Key" in understanding
what happened to Mankind both [Pre and Post 10,000 B.C. aka the last of the ice age melt off] Again great presentation.

          I completely agree that what you talked about is a necessity to bring up.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As you can probably tell that I am rather against the whole Aryan theory....the Dravidan however is something I shall be looking more deeply into.
That indeed is a possibility.

          <br/>
          What makes you believe that Dwarka is older? Yep my eye is pretty untrained haha...I wish I could be part of the team that is excavating it. Apart
from the idea that a civilization cannot just occur...it has to slowly grow. Yet maybe there is a reason for this...Ancient aliens? Some kind of
destruction wiping out the evidence? Possibly using those tools to make better ones? Migration is yes a possibility. Do you know of any evidence of
migration? As in evidence found on a possible path taken...any archeological evidence..

          Im still reading the texts of ancient India. They not only contain descriptions of ancient technology but go back even further than that describing
the entire History of the whole Universe. Whatever happened in India a long time ago it was more advanced than we are today. Einstein said he was
inspired to his theories by the Vedas.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The Vimana stuff will be debunked by some people who come here because its a channelled text from the 19th Century. However, looking at the original
ancient sources there is still enough material to know there were flying aircraft and high technology in ancient India. Some of my older threads go
into this.

          I mistyped India when I meant the Indus valley. You, are absolutely right in that there have been some evidence found. Now as far as there being a
direct link between Jwalapuram and the earliest origins of the Indus valley I'd love to read about that. What I was referring to was the early
developmental period of the region leading up to that level of culture/civilization in the Indus valley region.

          There are some tantalizing sites, but of course more shall be revealed as time goes on.

          Nice to see so much combined here, I always found the Indian history fascinating and I really think humans have devastated this (and maybe other
planets) before, but without knowing history, people are doomed to repeat it.

          J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, was once asked by a student:
          <span class="postBold">
           "Was the bomb exploded at Alamogordo during the Manhattan Project
the first one to be detonated?"
          </span>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          To which he replied:
          <span class="postBold">
           "Well -- yes. In modern times, of course."
          </span>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This isn't so much Oppenheimer revealing any secret knowledge, it's merely him hinting at his personal beliefs formed after reading the Bhagavad
Gita.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <blockquote class="external">
           <i class="icon-cloud">
           </i>
           <br/>
           Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <span class="postBold">
            If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one ...
           </span>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time: namely, the famous verse:
           <span class="postBold">
            "I am become Death, the
shatterer of worlds."
           </span>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In 1965, he was persuaded to quote again for a television broadcast:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu
scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form
and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."

          But regarding the photos in the 2nd post, please see the links the mod added to the bottom of the post, those supposed images of modern flying
machines are not that at all, they are standard hieroglyphics that were modified over time and as a result look like something they're not. It should
be quite obvious that if the ancient Egyptians saw something as stunning (to them) as an attack helicoptor that it would surely rank higher in
