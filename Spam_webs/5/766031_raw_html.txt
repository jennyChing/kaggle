Priority Level 1 means, whenever\nyou stand in a queue, you immediately become the first in the queue, unless\nother Level 1 users are already standing there.\n\n\nLevel 1 also allows you to\nschedule your future photo shoots in the Lite Studios, by selecting from\navailable dates and hours.\n\n\n2. Priority Level 2 means, whenever\nyou stand in a queue, you will immediately become the first in the queue,\nunless other Level 2 users are already standing in the queue, and unless any Level\n1 user decides to stand there. In this case you will be standing immediately\nafter them.\n\n\n3. Priority Level 3 means that\nwhenever you stand in a queue, you will immediately become the first in the\nqueue, unless other Level 3 users are already standing in the queue, and unless\nany Level 2 or Level 1 user decides to stand there. In this case you will be\nstanding immediately after them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;img style=\"max-width:620px;\" src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/883996/files/20140926051110-Lens5.jpg?1411733470\"&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;NO FLAKE MODELS, NO MODELS BEING LATE\u003C/h3&gt;\nMany photographers are familiar with a situation when they schedule a photo shoot with a model, but the model is being late or even flakes (no call, no show). Preparing the studio and sitting and waiting for a model that never shows... Ugh, what may be worse?\n\nIn the online studio studio all models will always be available as scheduled and schedule of every model will be publicly viewable on site.\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;REFERRAL PROGRAM\u003C/h3&gt;\nHelp\nus by spreading the word via email and social media. After the campaign is\nfunded we'll refund your contribution in accordance with credits you earned\nreferring people.\n\n\nIn short: if you successfully refer a friend to contribute to the campaign,\nthen we will refund you $50. If you refer one more friend \u2013 we will refund you\nanother $50. And so on. \n\n\nIf the amount of credits you earned has covered the sum of your pre-ordered\npackage (so you get a complete refund), any further referral $ will be credited\nto your account. After the studio goes live, you can spend these $ for getting\nthe PRO studio access. And don\u2019t forget, as a contributor, you also have up to\n70% Pro discount, as well as you have a priority access to the free Lite\nStudios.\n\nPlease note that contributors cannot receive referral \ncredit for referring themselves. Of two contributors, only one can be \nthe 'referrer' and receive campaign credit for the other's \ncontribution.\u00a0 Refunds will be made and credits applied once the \ncampaign is over.\n\nHow to participate in the referral program:\nIt\u2019s\n simple. Log in to your Indiegogo account . Be sure to use the same \naccount you used when you contributed your Remote Studio Package. Then, \nlook below our main video at the top of this page for buttons to share \nand copy your unique URL. Start sharing!\n\nNeed more information?\u00a0 We have created detailed instructions &lt;a href=\"http://topmodelgroup.com/en/component/k2/item/43-referral-program\"&gt;here\u003C/a&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;img style=\"max-width:620px;\" src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/921446/files/20141011023023-DancersCut6.jpg?1413019823\"&gt;\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE\n\n\u003C/h3&gt;\n\n\nSoftware:\n\n1.\u00a0 We have already developed the program code to control Pan-Tilt heads\nand vertical/horizontal motorized sliders from computer.\n\n2. We have the tethering code to remotely set camera settings, obtain a live-view\nfrom the camera, release camera shutter, download files, etc. For both Canon\nand Nikon.\n\n3. We have a streaming server and browser client to perform a low-latency streaming of the\ncamera's live view to your browser through the web, and control the camera. It is reliable and proven to work with a very low latency even if you're in USA or Australia when the studio is in Europe.\n\n\nHardware:\n\n1. We have already tested third-party pan-tilt heads for this system. They work\nfine, they are reliable and not expensive.\n\n2. We performed some testing for vertical/horizontal sliding of the entire\nsystem (will be mounted on vertical and horizontal rails). Not ideal yet, but\nOK.\n\n3. All devices (motors, lighting) are interfaced with Raspberry Pi via Arduino (single-board microcontroller, intended to make building interactive objects or environments more accessible). \n\n\n\n\n&lt;img style=\"max-width:620px;\" src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/953067/files/20141023010102-arduinoRaspberry.jpg?1414051262\"&gt;\n\n\nHuman:\n\n1. We very well know how to manage the development of the technical part of the\nproject, as we have experience in managing software development and\nmicrocontroller/robotic development.\n\n2. At the same time, being modeling agents we have the full understanding\u00a0of\nworking with photo models.\n\n3. Finally, we have top class photo models ready to work for affordable rates.\nThis will allow us to keep prices stated above for the Pro studio, and even\nprovide free access to the Lite studio. See more information about this\u00a0below,\nin the Q&amp;A section.\n\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;WHAT WE NEED\u003C/h3&gt;\n\n\nSoftware:\n\n1. We need to implement a web interface to flawlessly control the local code mentioned\nabove (both positioning and tethering) via the web.\n\n2. We need to build the website: designing the layout, managing user accounts,\nmanaging access permissions to different studios, queuing and scheduling access\nto free studios, priority access for contributors, etc. This is possibly the\nmost trivial part, but at the same time the most boring and expensive stage of\nthe software part of the project.\n\nHardware:\n\nAs said above, we still need some working over the horizontal/vertical sliding\nsystem.\u00a0\n\nOther:\n\nWe need a photo studio itself including:\n\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0Placement - we are going to acquire ownership of the estate property to get\nrid of rental fees, because this will significantly reduce the price of the service\nfor end users. Therefore it will also be more profitable to us, so this is a\nwin-win solution.\u003C/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Equipment for the studios.\u003C/span&gt;\u003C/li&gt;\n\u003C/ol&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS\u003C/h3&gt;\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;How many photo studios are planned?\n\n\nAt first,\nwe will start with four photo studios located in the adjacent rooms of the same\nbuilding. If we\u2019ll see the service is demanded, we will increase the number of\nstudios, as we don\u2019t feel lack of photo models.\n\n\n2.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0\n\u003C/span&gt;The life\ncycle of the shutter of a camera is limited. How often will you replace cameras\nin a studio? This might be costly. \n\n\nWhile testing\nour business model, we revealed that the most active and tireless photographers\ntake about 10 shots per minute during a 30-minutes photo session. The production\ncost of one shot in terms of the resource of a shutter is calculated as $0.016\nper shot (the average market price of Canon 5D Mk3, $2400, divided by the life\ncycle of a shutter claimed by the company - 150,000 actuations). For Nikon D800\ncosts are even lower. Therefore, in terms of camera\u2019s resources the cost of production\nof one hour of the most intensive shooting is 10*60*0.016=$9.6. This sum pays\noff by additional paid services. Also, we carry on negotiations with potential\nsponsors - photo equipment vendors interested in supporting the project if it\nproves to be demanded.\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;3.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;Professional models working in two\nfree photo studios and two low-cost ones \u2013 sounds good, but how you are going\nto pay them? What is the source of the funds?\n\n\nWe are the\nfounders of the TopModelGroup.com portal, model agents recruiting and training\nmodels. Among other countries, we also work in several developing economies\nwhere hourly rates are much lower (several and even dozens of times) than in\nUS, Europe and other developed countries. Such countries are Moldova, Ukraine,\nByelorussia, which is geographically located in Europe, but are actually\ndeveloping economies with average monthly salary about $400. \n\n\nAfter finishing\ntraining and before signing an international contract (that means earning real money), our every model must\ncomplete a 6-month probation. During this period they get a salary typical to\nthe country they live in. At the same time, they are already top-class models\npassed through our hard training and possessing stunning looks. Due to the same\nreason we don\u2019t have to overpay to such specialists as make up artists and hair\nstylists. Our first photo studio will be opened in one of such countries, and\nfurther in other countries too.\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;4.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;Ok, hiring even the best models is\nnot expensive for you. But what about rental fees for a photo studio? They are\nstill high. How can you keep prices low and even more \u2013 offer free services as\nwell?\n\n\nWe plan to acquire\nownership of the photo studio, because this will allow us to get rid of monthly\nrental fees and therefore minimize prices for end users. Thanks God, real\nestate costs are low in the countries we are talking about comparing with USA\nor Europe.\n\n\nFree studios\nare funded by paid studios.\n\n&lt;span&gt;5.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;What if you won\u2019t receive backing in\nfull?\n\n\nAll promised\nbonuses for our backers will remain valid. Partial funding means we will embody\nour idea step by step. Instead of four studios, we will stop on just two (one\nLite and one Pro). The entire process may slow down, but we'll complete it anyway.\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;What if you will see more backing\nthan you ask?\n\n\nIn that case\nwe will equip more photo studios, not just four, in proportion to received funding\nin order to supply the demand and grant our bonuses to all contributors faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;img style=\"max-width:620px;\" src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/904101/files/20141004131909-MaleModels3.jpg?1412453949\"&gt;\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\u003C/ul&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\u003C/ul&gt;\n\u003C/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;\n\u003C/h3&gt;\n\n\n\u003C/div&gt;\n\u003C/div&gt;\n\u003C/div&gt;","tagline":"Robotic online photo studio with professional photo models and high-end photo cameras","image_data":{"public_id":"pizwrqyeehkdqvg6oewz"},"last_saved":1425517352000,"geolocation":{},"status":"ended","visible_to_public":true,"update_path":"/private_api/simple_campaigns/robostage-robotic-photo-studio-with-web-access","bank_info_path":"/projects/952684/bank_info","received_contributions":true,"has_required_disbursement_attributes":false,"refresh_path":"/private_api/simple_campaigns/robostage-robotic-photo-studio-with-web-access","avatar_data":null,"recipient":null,"urls":{},"owner_name":"Evgheni Svirepov","balance":278,"currency":{"iso_num":840,"iso_code":"USD","symbol":"$"},"created_at":"2014-09-23T04:40:50-07:00","updated_at":"2015-03-04T17:02:32-08:00","funding_started_at":"2014-12-03T01:07:21-08:00","funding_ends_at":"2015-02-01T23:59:59-08:00","show_shipping_fees":true,"video_overlay_url":null,"description_html":"&lt;div&gt;We are professional modeling agents and foundes of a modeling community known as &lt;a href=\"http://topmodelgroup.com\"&gt;TopModelGroup.com\u003C/a&gt;, and we launch crowdfunding for online photo studio.\u00a0 Professional photographers and amateur ones can direct and control their\u00a0photo shoots from anywhere in the world.

We have a streaming server and browser client to perform a low-latency streaming of the\ncamera's live view to your browser through the web, and control the camera. It is reliable and proven to work with a very low latency even if you're in USA or Australia when the studio is in Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nHardware:&lt;br&gt;\n1. We have already tested third-party pan-tilt heads for this system. They work\nfine, they are reliable and not expensive.&lt;br&gt;\n2.

All devices (motors, lighting) are interfaced with Raspberry Pi via Arduino (single-board microcontroller, intended to make building interactive objects or environments more accessible). &lt;br&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=\"max-width:620px;\" src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/953067/files/20141023010102-arduinoRaspberry.jpg?1414051262\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human:&lt;br&gt;\n1. We very well know how to manage the development of the technical part of the\nproject, as we have experience in managing software development and\nmicrocontroller/robotic development.&lt;br&gt;\n2. At the same time, being modeling agents we have the full understanding\u00a0of\nworking with photo models.&lt;br&gt;\n3. Finally, we have top class photo models ready to work for affordable rates.\nThis will allow us to keep prices stated above for the Pro studio, and even\nprovide free access to the Lite studio. See more information about this\u00a0below,\nin the Q&amp;A section.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;h3&gt;WHAT WE NEED\u003C/h3&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Software:&lt;br&gt;\n1. We need to implement a web interface to flawlessly control the local code mentioned\nabove (both positioning and tethering) via the web.&lt;br&gt;\n2. We need to build the website: designing the layout, managing user accounts,\nmanaging access permissions to different studios, queuing and scheduling access\nto free studios, priority access for contributors, etc. This is possibly the\nmost trivial part, but at the same time the most boring and expensive stage of\nthe software part of the project.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hardware:&lt;br&gt;\nAs said above, we still need some working over the horizontal/vertical sliding\nsystem.\u00a0\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other:&lt;br&gt;\nWe need a photo studio itself including:&lt;br&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u00a0Placement - we are going to acquire ownership of the estate property to get\nrid of rental fees, because this will significantly reduce the price of the service\nfor end users. Therefore it will also be more profitable to us, so this is a\nwin-win solution.\u003C/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0Equipment for the studios.\u003C/span&gt;\u003C/li&gt;\n\u003C/ol&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS\u003C/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;How many photo studios are planned?\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first,\nwe will start with four photo studios located in the adjacent rooms of the same\nbuilding. If we\u2019ll see the service is demanded, we will increase the number of\nstudios, as we don\u2019t feel lack of photo models.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0\n\u003C/span&gt;The life\ncycle of the shutter of a camera is limited. How often will you replace cameras\nin a studio? This might be costly. \u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While testing\nour business model, we revealed that the most active and tireless photographers\ntake about 10 shots per minute during a 30-minutes photo session. The production\ncost of one shot in terms of the resource of a shutter is calculated as $0.016\nper shot (the average market price of Canon 5D Mk3, $2400, divided by the life\ncycle of a shutter claimed by the company - 150,000 actuations). For Nikon D800\ncosts are even lower. Therefore, in terms of camera\u2019s resources the cost of production\nof one hour of the most intensive shooting is 10*60*0.016=$9.6. This sum pays\noff by additional paid services. Also, we carry on negotiations with potential\nsponsors - photo equipment vendors interested in supporting the project if it\nproves to be demanded.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;Professional models working in two\nfree photo studios and two low-cost ones \u2013 sounds good, but how you are going\nto pay them? What is the source of the funds?\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are the\nfounders of the TopModelGroup.com portal, model agents recruiting and training\nmodels. Among other countries, we also work in several developing economies\nwhere hourly rates are much lower (several and even dozens of times) than in\nUS, Europe and other developed countries. Such countries are Moldova, Ukraine,\nByelorussia, which is geographically located in Europe, but are actually\ndeveloping economies with average monthly salary about $400. \u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After finishing\ntraining and before signing an international contract (that means earning real money), our every model must\ncomplete a 6-month probation. During this period they get a salary typical to\nthe country they live in. At the same time, they are already top-class models\npassed through our hard training and possessing stunning looks. Due to the same\nreason we don\u2019t have to overpay to such specialists as make up artists and hair\nstylists. Our first photo studio will be opened in one of such countries, and\nfurther in other countries too.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;Ok, hiring even the best models is\nnot expensive for you. But what about rental fees for a photo studio? They are\nstill high. How can you keep prices low and even more \u2013 offer free services as\nwell?\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We plan to acquire\nownership of the photo studio, because this will allow us to get rid of monthly\nrental fees and therefore minimize prices for end users. Thanks God, real\nestate costs are low in the countries we are talking about comparing with USA\nor Europe.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free studios\nare funded by paid studios.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;What if you won\u2019t receive backing in\nfull?\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All promised\nbonuses for our backers will remain valid. Partial funding means we will embody\nour idea step by step. Instead of four studios, we will stop on just two (one\nLite and one Pro). The entire process may slow down, but we'll complete it anyway.&lt;br&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;span&gt;\u00a0 \u003C/span&gt;\u003C/span&gt;What if you will see more backing\nthan you ask?\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case\nwe will equip more photo studios, not just four, in proportion to received funding\nin order to supply the demand and grant our bonuses to all contributors faster.\u003C/p&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=\"max-width:620px;\"

          </p>
          <p>
           3. Easily and quickly
shoot any promotional pictures and videos: models can wear a t-shirt with your
logo (printed in 10 minutes by your request); models can draw your logo or
custom text on a message board in real time; models can say something about
your company when you shoot video; you can shoot models against a green background
to replace it later with your own background picture or video (chroma keying).
          </p>
          <p>
           4. For novice photographers:
create a professional-looking portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Feel the difference

          <p>
           Many photographers are familiar with a situation when they schedule a photo shoot with a model, but the model is being late or even flakes (no call, no show). Preparing the studio and sitting and waiting for a model that never shows... Ugh, what may be worse?
          </p>
          <p>
           In the online studio studio all models will always be available as scheduled and schedule of every model will be publicly viewable on site.

           REFERRAL PROGRAM
          </h3>
          Help
us by spreading the word via email and social media. After the campaign is
funded we'll refund your contribution in accordance with credits you earned
referring people.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In short: if you successfully refer a friend to contribute to the campaign,
then we will refund you $50. If you refer one more friend  we will refund you
another $50. And so on.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If the amount of credits you earned has covered the sum of your pre-ordered
package (so you get a complete refund), any further referral $ will be credited
to your account. After the studio goes live, you can spend these $ for getting
the PRO studio access. And dont forget, as a contributor, you also have up to
70% Pro discount, as well as you have a priority access to the free Lite
Studios.
          <br/>

          Please note that contributors cannot receive referral 
credit for referring themselves. Of two contributors, only one can be 
the 'referrer' and receive campaign credit for the other's 
contribution. Refunds will be made and credits applied once the 
campaign is over.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          How to participate in the referral program:

           WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE
           <br/>
          </h3>
          <p>
           Software:
           <br/>
           1. We have already developed the program code to control Pan-Tilt heads
and vertical/horizontal motorized sliders from computer.
           <br/>
           2. We have the tethering code to remotely set camera settings, obtain a live-view
from the camera, release camera shutter, download files, etc. For both Canon
and Nikon.
           <br/>
           3. We have a streaming server and browser client to perform a low-latency streaming of the
camera's live view to your browser through the web, and control the camera. It is reliable and proven to work with a very low latency even if you're in USA or Australia when the studio is in Europe.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Hardware:
           <br/>
           1. We have already tested third-party pan-tilt heads for this system. They work
fine, they are reliable and not expensive.
           <br/>
           2. We performed some testing for vertical/horizontal sliding of the entire
system (will be mounted on vertical and horizontal rails). Not ideal yet, but
OK.
           <br/>
           3. All devices (motors, lighting) are interfaced with Raspberry Pi via Arduino (single-board microcontroller, intended to make building interactive objects or environments more accessible).
           <br/>

          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
           Human:
           <br/>
           1. We very well know how to manage the development of the technical part of the
project, as we have experience in managing software development and
microcontroller/robotic development.
           <br/>
           2. At the same time, being modeling agents we have the full understandingof
working with photo models.
           <br/>
           3. Finally, we have top class photo models ready to work for affordable rates.
This will allow us to keep prices stated above for the Pro studio, and even
provide free access to the Lite studio. See more information about thisbelow,
in the Q&amp;A section.

          <p>
           Software:
           <br/>
           1. We need to implement a web interface to flawlessly control the local code mentioned
above (both positioning and tethering) via the web.
           <br/>
           2. We need to build the website: designing the layout, managing user accounts,
managing access permissions to different studios, queuing and scheduling access
to free studios, priority access for contributors, etc. This is possibly the
most trivial part, but at the same time the most boring and expensive stage of
the software part of the project.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hardware:
           <br/>
           As said above, we still need some working over the horizontal/vertical sliding
system.
          </p>
          <p>
           Other:
           <br/>
           We need a photo studio itself including:
           <br/>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Placement - we are going to acquire ownership of the estate property to get
rid of rental fees, because this will significantly reduce the price of the service
for end users. Therefore it will also be more profitable to us, so this is a
win-win solution.
           </li>
           <li>
            <span>
             Equipment for the studios.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <br/>
          <p>
           <span>
           </span>
          </p>
          <h3>
           QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS
          </h3>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           <span>
            1.
            <span>
            </span>
           </span>
           How many photo studios are planned?
          </p>
          <p>
           At first,
we will start with four photo studios located in the adjacent rooms of the same
building. If well see the service is demanded, we will increase the number of
studios, as we dont feel lack of photo models.
          </p>
          <p>
           2.
           <span>
           </span>
           The life
cycle of the shutter of a camera is limited. How often will you replace cameras
in a studio? This might be costly.
          </p>
          <p>
           While testing
our business model, we revealed that the most active and tireless photographers
take about 10 shots per minute during a 30-minutes photo session. The production
cost of one shot in terms of the resource of a shutter is calculated as $0.016
per shot (the average market price of Canon 5D Mk3, $2400, divided by the life
cycle of a shutter claimed by the company - 150,000 actuations). For Nikon D800
costs are even lower. Therefore, in terms of cameras resources the cost of production
of one hour of the most intensive shooting is 10*60*0.016=$9.6. This sum pays
off by additional paid services. Also, we carry on negotiations with potential
sponsors - photo equipment vendors interested in supporting the project if it
proves to be demanded.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span>
            3.
            <span>
            </span>
           </span>
           Professional models working in two
free photo studios and two low-cost ones  sounds good, but how you are going
to pay them? What is the source of the funds?
          </p>
          <p>
           We are the
founders of the TopModelGroup.com portal, model agents recruiting and training
models. Among other countries, we also work in several developing economies
where hourly rates are much lower (several and even dozens of times) than in
US, Europe and other developed countries. Such countries are Moldova, Ukraine,
Byelorussia, which is geographically located in Europe, but are actually
developing economies with average monthly salary about $400.
          </p>
          <p>
           After finishing
training and before signing an international contract (that means earning real money), our every model must
complete a 6-month probation. During this period they get a salary typical to
the country they live in. At the same time, they are already top-class models
passed through our hard training and possessing stunning looks. Due to the same
reason we dont have to overpay to such specialists as make up artists and hair
stylists. Our first photo studio will be opened in one of such countries, and
further in other countries too.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span>
            4.
            <span>
            </span>
           </span>
           Ok, hiring even the best models is
not expensive for you. But what about rental fees for a photo studio? They are
still high. How can you keep prices low and even more  offer free services as
well?
          </p>
          <p>
           We plan to acquire
ownership of the photo studio, because this will allow us to get rid of monthly
rental fees and therefore minimize prices for end users. Thanks God, real
estate costs are low in the countries we are talking about comparing with USA
or Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
           Free studios
are funded by paid studios.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span>
            5.
            <span>
            </span>
           </span>
           What if you wont receive backing in
full?
          </p>
          <p>
           All promised
bonuses for our backers will remain valid. Partial funding means we will embody
our idea step by step. Instead of four studios, we will stop on just two (one
Lite and one Pro). The entire process may slow down, but we'll complete it anyway.
           <br/>
          </p>
          <p>
           <span>
            6.
            <span>
            </span>
           </span>
           What if you will see more backing
than you ask?
          </p>
          <p>
           In that case
we will equip more photo studios, not just four, in proportion to received funding
in order to supply the demand and grant our bonuses to all contributors faster.
