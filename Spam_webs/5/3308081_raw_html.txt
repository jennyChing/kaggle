       The Structural Engineering Slide Library was collected over the period 1950
through 1980. It was developed as a visual resource for illustrating 
structural systems in undergraduate courses in structural analysis and 
design. Each structure is identified, and a brief description is given. 
The collection was made available in 1980. For publication on the Internet, the
original collection and writing have been retained, largely without editing,
but supplemented with additional slides and more recent structures. The 
original slides are numbered in the form Nx, the additional slides in the
form Nx.y.

    The
    <em>
     Structural Engineering Slide Library
    </em>
    is the product of 30 years
of teaching structural analysis, structural design, and architectural
engineering to undergraduate and graduate students in Europe and the United
States. During this period the author has traveled extensively and has used
color photography to bring to the classroom illustrations of structural
engineering so that theory can be related directly to practice. The resulting
slides are not always the standard type of book illustrations, but rather 
views taken from specific angles for the express purpose of illustrating 
particular facets of structural theory, response, or design. Over the years,
this has developed into a large and comprehensive collection taken in many
countries, covering all kinds of structural engineering, historic as well
as modern. The Slide Library is a selection of 560 slides from this larger
collection.
   </p>
   <p>
    In teaching courses on structural analysis, the author has found such a
resource invaluable in supplementing the rigor of engineering analysis with
applications to real life. Without such immediate illustration, engineering
mathematics can be uninteresting, difficult to understand, and easily
misapplied. In addition, it is often useful to start analysis with an actual
structure rather than with a line diagram, to develop an expertise in 
structural idealization alongside the necessary competence in equation 
solving. As the advent of microcomputers makes the analysis of complex
structures readily available to students early in their training, without
necessarily developing an equivalent knowledge of structural geometry and
response, careful illustration becomes increasingly important. Finally, it
is found that in certain courses the use of case studies is an ideal means
of both teaching and learning the whole process of structural engineering
from the choice of geometry, to structural idealization, equation solving, 
and finally to design, construction, and structural behavior. Hence the 
Library has been developed with these three uses in mind, and having this
resource available makes possible certain kinds of teaching that might
otherwise be difficult.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most structural systems are illustrated, and throughout the Library certain 
structures are singled out in each section for more extensive coverage
using overall views, views from different angles, and close-ups of details 
such as boundary supports that have a significant influence on the method of 
analysis and on the resulting structural behavior.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Library consists of these slide sets:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_a.html">
      Set A: Beam Structures
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_b.html">
      Set B: Arch Structures
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_c.html">
      Set C: Cable and Suspension Structures
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_d.html">
      Set D: Truss Structures
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_e.html">
      Set E: Domes and Shells
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_f.html">
      Set F: Columns, Rigid Frames, Grids and Slabs
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="godden_g.html">
      Set G: Structures Under Construction
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="/leonhardt/">
      Set H: The Structures of Leonhardt, Andr and Partners
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="/bertero/">
      Set J: Earthquake Engineering
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Most chapters deal with the subject matter in two ways, historically and
by subdivision into structural types. Sets A through F are similar in 
layout, except that
    <a href="godden_f.html">
     Set F: Columns, Rigid Frames, Grids and Slabs
    </a>
    covers more than one topic.
    <a href="godden_g.html">
     Set G: Structures Under Construction
    </a>
    is different in
that it deals with a series of structures under construction. This is an
important topic, as it is during construction that deflections can sometimes
be seen, for example, the gross deflections in a partially completed 
suspension bridge. The structural system and the degree of indeterminacy
in the construction phase are often completely different from the 
load-carrying system after completion, as in a continuous bridge constructed
from a series of simply supported precast beams that only gains its
continuity with the casting of the integral deck slab. This set can be used
in a general discussion of constructional procedures and the way analysis
is done at different stages.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are other ways that topics can be derived from the Library. It is
interesting to start an introductory course on structural analysis with a
discussion of boundary conditions, degrees of freedom, and internal force
releases, by selecting examples from all of the sets to show the generality
of these concepts. It is also a simple matter to take a 'horizontal cut' 
through the library and group together slides dealing with masonry
structures, concrete, prestressed concrete, steel, or timber structures.
   </p>

    The earliest slides were taken on the original Kodachrome film using a 
Leica camera with 35mm Summaron, 50mm Elmar, and 135mm Hektor lenses.
The dyes in this material have remained remarkably stable over a long
period, and there is no discernable fading. Its one drawback was the 
very slow speed which made it difficult to take interior shots without 
time exposures. The most recent slides have been taken on Kodachrome 64
and Ektachrome 400 using a Nikon camera with 35mm, 50mm, and 105mm Nikkor
lenses. High speed Ektachrome is ideal for indoor shots of poorly lighted
stadia.

    The author would like to make the following acknowledgements: to Dr. Leonhardt
and his staff in Stuttgart for arranging visits to two of his bridges under
construction; to Mr. Charles Seim of the State of California Baytoll Crossing
Authority for arranging visits to the Dumbarton Bridge during the early and
latter stages of construction; and to Mr. F. T. Godden of London who provided
slides of the cable-spinning operation during the construction of the Forth
Suspension Bridge and also supplied some pictures of the bridges by 
Stephenson and Telford.
