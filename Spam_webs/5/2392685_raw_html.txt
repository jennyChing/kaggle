          .  Another trial court in New Mexico, however, didnt, and became a national icon when the jury claimed that Stella Liebeck deserved $2.9 million in compensatory and punitive damages because McDonalds dared to sell the 79-year-old hot 170-degree coffee.

         <p>
          The case is ludicrous on its face, as a matter of law and as a matter of common sense.  Eleven years later, this should be beyond debate, yet somehow, it keeps coming up in the blogs, and we keep having to refute it.  (

          Amazingly, rather than argue that the tort system shouldnt be judged by the occasional outlier, the litigation lobby has succeeded in persuading some in the media and on the left that the Liebeck case is actually an aspirational result for the tort system, and, not only that, but that anyone who says otherwise is just a foolish right-winger buying into urban legends (

         </p>
         <p>
          But the real urban legend has to be that the case has any legitimacy.  Worse, this urban legend is being taught to a generation of law students by professors like Jonathan Turley and

          .  Now, any peripheral mention of the McDonalds coffee case provokes a gigantic backlash from the left, who, while congratulating themselves on their seeing past the common-sense view of the case and being above urban legends, spread a number of urban legends of their own about the case.

          According to a Sep. 1, 1994 Wall Street Journal interview with Reed Morgan, Liebecks attorney, he measured the temperature at 18 restaurants and 20 McDonalds, and McDonalds was responsible for nine of the twelve highest temperature readings.  Which means that, even before one accounts for conscious or unconscious bias in the measurements, at least three, and probably more (what about the other eleven McDonalds?), restaurants were serving coffee at a higher temperature.  And Starbucks serves at a higher temperature today, and faces lawsuits over third-degree burns as a result (

          The tort system is meant to deter wrongdoing; the mistake of the left is the increasingly successful attempt to make the main purpose compensating the injured, and redistributing wealth from wealthier bystanders tangentially related to the victim who havent done anything wrong.  The tort system is a remarkably inefficient means of performing this task, which is why litigation reform is needed.

          : The jury award was $2.9 million.  The court lowered this to $650,000.  Both Liebeck and McDonalds appealed, and then settled, allegedly for something close to, if not identical to, the final judgment.  McDonalds didnt have a losing case: it was only the error of the judge in letting the case get to the jury combined with the error of the jury that caused them to lose.  The fact that a defendant can exposed to many multiples of actual damages is one of the serious problems of the tort system.  Even when 9 out of 10 juries get it right, if the tenth jury awards ten times as much damages as it should, it undoes the work of the juries that exonerated the defendant.  This encourages lottery litigation.  (E.g.,

Because a coffee-spill is usually the fault of the person who spilled the coffee.  The Liebeck jury and judge decided to mostly blame the deep pocket instead.

            Imagine the effect of squeezing a full cup of anything enough to burst the cover off the top.  Thats a lot of scalding fluid that would have rushed out all at once.

            To be precise, Liebeck was a 79-year-old passenger in the car, and spilled the coffee when she removed the cup lid to add cream and sugar.

            In my experience, if there is one U.S. case that non-U.S. lawyers are aware of (and want to ask you about in incredulous tones at cocktail parties), it is the McDonalds Hot Cup of Coffee case. OverLawyered discusses.

            I have a couple of points:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) A judge is not supposed to throw out a case if reasonable minds can differ about whether the case has merit. The seemingly never-ending debate about the Liebeck case should be exhibit A in the argument for why the judge did the right thing by letting the case go to the jury.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) The tort system is not just about punishing wrongd0ing. Nor is it an insurance system. It is actually a free-market mechanism for ensuring that manufacturers devote an economically efficient amount of resources to product safety. The cost of accidents caused by unsafe products is what economists call an external cost. That means that the cost is born by someone other than the manufacturer of the product.
           </p>
           <p>
            In that way, the cost of accidents is similar to the cost of pollution. For example, if I have an outhouse near a stream, I can either install a septic system or let the waste drain directly into the stream. Its cheaper for me to drain the waste into the stream, but it imposes an additional cost on my downstream neighbors, I have benefited by externalizing the cost of my waste treatment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Products liability laws are intended to internalize the cost of accidents caused by unreasonably dangerous products. By making the manufacturer responsible for paying the cost of accidents caused by its products, the manufacturer can reduce its products liability exposure by investing in safer products. Because the law requires reasonable efforts, as opposed to an absolute guarantee of safety, manufacturers can estimate, though not without some difficulty and uncertainty, the appropriate amount of reduction in liability expense for a given investment in safety and stop making safety investments when the return on investment ceases to make it worthwhile to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is essentially what Ford did with its infamous Pinto calculation. The problem was not that Ford made the calculation, but that it cynically undervalued the lives that it calculated would be lost as a result of its failure to make the Pinto a safer vehicle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether you believe the Luebeck case was rightly or wrongly decided is really irrelevant to this calculation. McDonalds should care less about individual liability decisions, particularly as any human decision process is going to be flawed, especially when it involves such emotionally charged issues. McDonalds should care about the gross liability from all injuries caused by its coffee and maximize its profit by making investments that will generate a competitive return by minimizing that liability.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is the same for those who would judge the tort system. Attacking the system as jackpot justice because there is such variability in individual cases is literally missing the forest for the trees. The question is whether the tort system as a whole is reducing the cost of injuries by more than the safety investments it requires.
           </p>
           <p>
            While Ive seen lots of arguments along the lines of the tort system costs jobs or is a hidden tax, those arguments only address half of the question. Any system of safety regulation is going to cost money. The question is, does it cost the right amount of money? Does the amount of money that the tort system diverts into safety measures exceed the amount of money that is saved by the injury reductions achieved by those diversions?
           </p>
           <p>
            Once that question is answered, which I have yet to see anyone in the anti-tort movement even attempt, the next question is how can we do it better? Would a central command type regime, in which government regulators take it upon themselves to calculate risks and mandate safety investments be a better solution? I dont think so. Government interventions are rarely as efficient as market forces.

            Several comments on yesterdays post merit responses. 1. One commenter invokes the Ford Pinto case, which is interesting because thats perhaps the most famous anti-reform urban legend of all. He mistakenly says that Fords problem

            Congratulations.  Yove just ENTIRELY NULLIFIED the entire concept of assumption of risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is, it doesnt matter if I WANT to buy hot coffee and am willing to take the risk of burning myself  it is ALWAYS the fault of the company, and therefore, I CANT buy hot coffee, as it would somehow be someone elses fault if I hurt myself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apply the same theory to knives, and notice how insane that is.  No more kitchen knives  someone might get hurt.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I completely and utterly disagree with you on whether individual cases matter  having someone take millions of dollars from your bank account when you did nothing wrong is a CRIME (commonly called theft).  Saying its for the greater good doesnt change that.  Otherwise, I recommend that we take all of your money  after all, its for the greater good.

            In your dealings with mass market companies, what avenue would you choose for informing the company that you would like to assume a certain risk? Would you call the CEO of McDonalds and say Hey Jim! Id like my coffee extra hot please! Send me down an assumption of the risk agreement and Ill get it right back to you!?
           </p>
           <p>
            Modern commerce would grind to a halt if each sale were accompanied by an individually negotiated agreement about division of risk between the buyer and seller.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to assume risk, find a seller whose risk profile matches your own. In the coffee scenario, maybe you go to a Starbucks instead of McDonalds.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theory I described is, with some gross simplifications, the way our current products liability system works, and wow! we still have knives. As a matter of fact, Im thinking about running with scissors when I finish this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are injured by a dangerous product, you will have to take money from your bank account to pay your medical bills, cover your living expenses while you recover, and take care of all the myriad other costs of suffering an injury, even though you did nothing wrong. Is it a crime for you to have to pay that money? Why is it then a crime for a manufacturer who could have prevented your injury but chose to cut costs instead to have to pay that money?

            No, that does not REMOTELY ressemble our current system.  In our current system, the most ridiculously risk averse sets the standard, and the products they cosnider too risky (and can convince a court are too risky) become unavailable.
           </p>
           <p>
            That doesnt quite apply to the coffee case (much as people like you would like it to) because every other case like Liebeck has been tossed out of court post haste.  If they had succeded, too, Starbucks would either serve cooler coffee or cease to exist.
           </p>

            That is, if Liebeck were correct, it would now be IMPOSSIBLE to buy really, really hot coffee.

            We still have kitchen knives for the same reason:  suits against the knife companies for people HURTING THEMSELVES with knives always fail.  If they were successful (and your logic applies exactly as well to knives), knives would no longer be available, or they would costs thousands of dollars each to cover the unbelievable liability.

            Knives are MORE dangerous than coffee.  They cause many more injuries each year.  If I injure myself with a product that is dangerous as part of its design (knives are sharp, coffee is hot), it is MY OWN FAULT, and it must be, or such products will not be sold.

            Do they? Product manufacturers are increasingly held liable for stupid, self-inflicted injury involving their product.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maytag lost a case a few years ago when someone was paralyzed by taking a ride in one of their dryers. Some UT doofus sues his fraternity after belly-flopping into a foot-deep wading pool. Bars are liable for selling booze to those who are too drunk, gun manufacturers are sued when a kid steals his fathers weapon and plugs a buddy, etc. etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, it happens  but not as much as it could, since most people are usually reluctant to sue for something thats their own damn fault. For now, anyway.

            You mean guns, right? Because if you replace guns for knives, you get the intended result of the Brady Centers gun lawsuits and similar actions undertaken the the AG of certain states. This is happening

            Quick question  under what authority was a court supposed to kick the case out?
           </p>
           <p>
            The way I learned the case in Civil Procedure (from Arthur Miller), the facts of the case as presented to the judge/jury were that McDonalds served its coffee at 30-40 degrees hotter than what was normal.  As your links show, that might not be true, but the judge cant very well take judicial notice of that fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Individual cases are won and lost for a variety of reasons.  I guess Ive always thought the purpose of learning some of the justifications behind the McDonalds case was to understand how such a decision could be reached, not to use it as proof of some immutable larger truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps McDonalds just hired bad counsel.

            The judge can indeed make some judgements about fact  in fact, I hope they do, regularly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example: I claim that McDonalds served their coffee 5,000 degrees hotter than normal.
           </p>
           <p>
            One would hope that the judge would throw that out.

            EB, nothing in my argument that the case should be thrown out relies upon the factual dispute over whether the coffee is actually thirty degrees hotter than industry standard.

            Why didnt McDonalds hire a better counsel?
           </p>

            Aha, another hidden gem of the Tort tax.
           </p>
           <p>
            Companies shouldnt have to consistently pony up the fees to put the best lawyers out there on trials that are inherently dumb.  Thats what they are, dumb.  Oddly enough, many items come underlabeled, because most people havent achieved the level of retardation/enlightnement to hurt themselves.  Household electricity is a significant hazard, and I will rue the day when lighters have frickin Danger, causes fires warnings on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until there are enough judges with brains out there (read if you bring a frivolous lawsuit, you pay your lawyer fees, opposing lawyer fees, and compensate the state for having to put up with your s**t), and then throw out cases such as these, it will remain problematic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand the need for legal oversight in cases where neglect or harmful intent is observed, and would even push that inadequate marking and too little safety research exists on some products (but punishing with exorbetent dog-and-pony shows is an unethical and wrong way to do it),
            <br/>
            but the problem is that stupid people just wont understand that life is inherently risky, and that nobody owes you jacks**t if you cause any harm to yourself.  You are only legally entitled to the ability to breathe free, the right to say what you wish and do what you wish, and to live without goventment inteference.  If you decide to purchase something from another individual or a corporation, thats a decision youve chosen to do.
            <br/>
            Caveat emptor: if you think your coffee might be too hot, ASK.  If not, then your assumption is irrelevant.  Unless there was misleading, gross error, or neglect on the part of the seller that an implied promise (note, no  implied promise that coffee wouldnt need to be handled carefully), then a means of legal (and political) recourse is simply wrong, and the legal system needs to stop selling itself out in these cases.
