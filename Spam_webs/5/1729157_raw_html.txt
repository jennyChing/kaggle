        <strong>
         Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
        </strong>
        (often abbreviated as
        <strong>
         PTSD
        </strong>
        ) is a severe
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/anxiety-resources" target="_blank">

        disorder that may develop as a result of exposure to a terribly  frightening, life-threatening, or otherwise highly unsafe experience (such as a

         .
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        The event precipitating PTSD may involve the threat of death to oneself or someone else. PTSD may develop after a
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/rape-resources" target="_blank">
         sexual or physical assault
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/grieving/" target="_blank">
         unexpected death of a loved  one
        </a>
        , an accident, war, or a natural disaster. Post-traumatic stress  disorder is a lasting consequence of such
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/stress-resources" target="_blank">
         stressful
        </a>
        ordeals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people who have experienced such traumatic events will have  reactions that include
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/anger-resources" target="_blank">
         anger
        </a>
        ,

         anxiety
        </a>
        . These  reactions are common and dissipate over time.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, for those living with PTSD, these
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/feelings-resources" target="_blank">
         feelings
        </a>
        increase and often become so strong  that they prevent the person from living a normal life.

        <strong>
         How To Cope With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: right;">
        <em>
         If you've been diagnosed with
         <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/ptsd-resources" target="_blank">
          post-traumatic stress disorder
         </a>
         , you may feel ashamed, guilty, you may face survivors guilt and feel stupid that you can't simply "get over it" like everyone expects you to. Here are some ways of coping with PTSD.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">
        Understand that the body has a memory for
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/stress-resources" target="_blank">
         stress
        </a>
        - so the worry and  panic or anxiety may be a natural reaction that we're  programmed for. The body remembers and acts - reprogramming can take  many years.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">
        Remind yourself as often as you need that
        <em>
         you don't have to be a
         <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/military-matters-resources" target="_blank">
          veteran
         </a>
         or the
         <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/rape-resources" target="_blank">
          victim of a sexual assault
         </a>
         to experience PTSD
        </em>
        .
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">
        Don't compare your story to another's. There are no better or worse reasons for developing PTSD - and if someone tries to play a game of the "Pain Olympics," you don't need them in your life.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">
        You're not weak for developing PTSD - it's a
        <strong>
         normal reaction
        </strong>
        to an
        <strong>
         abnormal and messed-up
        </strong>
        situation.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">
        Many people who have PTSD also struggle with survivor's guilt.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: right;">
        <em>
         Read more about
         <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/survivor-guilt-resources/" target="_blank">
          survivor's guilt
         </a>
         .
        </em>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">
        Don't hesitate to tell people what you need from them. Many times, people will become confused by PTSD; unsure of how to behave and act around you. So tell them - if you need help around the house or with errands, ask for help.
       </p>

        PTSD has
        <em>
         very
        </em>
        specific and
        <em>
         very
        </em>
        debilitating symptoms. Here are some ways to cope with these symptoms:
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Intrusive memories, thoughts or images:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Remind yourself that they're just memories.
        </li>
        <li>
         Remember that while these can be overwhelming, the reminders often dissipate over time.
        </li>
        <li>
         Remind yourself that it's normal to have memories of the traumatic event.
        </li>
        <li>
         Talk about these things with someone that you trust.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Sudden feelings of
         <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/panic-disorder-resources/" target="_blank">
          panic
         </a>
         or

         :
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        PTSD often leaves us with our hearts pounding, feeling light-headed or  spacey (often caused by quick breathing.) If this is something that  happens, remember:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         These reactions aren't dangerous - you wouldn't notice if you had them while exercising.
        </li>
        <li>
         These feelings may come with scary thoughts, which is what may make them so upsetting. These scary thoughts are not true.
        </li>
        <li>
         Try to slow down your breathing.
        </li>
        <li>
         These awful sensations will pass.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Difficulty concentrating or focusing:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Slow down - give yourself time to focus upon what it is you need to do.
        </li>
        <li>
         Make "to-do" lists every day.
        </li>
        <li>
         Break big tasks into smaller doable chunks.
        </li>
        <li>
         Plan a realistic amount of tasks to do in a day.
        </li>
        <li>
         You may be suffering depression - if so, talk to your doctor about your symptoms.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Trouble feeling or expressing positive emotions:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Remind yourself that this is a common reaction to trauma, not something you're doing on purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
         Don't feel guilty for something you can't control.
        </li>
        <li>
         Continue engaging in activities you like or used to like. Even if  you don't think you'll enjoy it now, once you get into it, you may find  yourself feeling pleasurable feelings.
        </li>
        <li>
         Take really small steps to tell your loved ones you care - write a card, leave a gift, send an email, call them to say hi.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Flashbacks
        </strong>
        :
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Keep your eyes open - look around and see, really see where you are.
        </li>
        <li>
         Talk to yourself. Remind yourself that you're here, that you're safe. The trauma is long-since over and you are in the present.
        </li>
        <li>
         Get up and move around. Take a drink of water or wash your hands. Interrupt the flashbacks with movements.
        </li>
        <li>
         Call someone you trust and tell them that you're experiencing a flashback.

        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Before reacting, take a time out to cool off and think.
        </li>
        <li>
         Walk away from the situation.
        </li>
        <li>
         Exercise every day - exercise reduces tension and relieves stress.
        </li>
        <li>
         Talk to your doctor about your anger.
        </li>
        <li>
         Take anger management classes.
        </li>
        <li>
         If you blow up at family or friends, find time to talk to them and explain what happened and what you are doing to cope with it.
        </li>
       </ul>

        <strong>
         Nightmares about the trauma:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         If you wake from a nightmare in a panic, remind yourself you're  reacting to a dream. The DREAM is responsible for the
         <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/panic-disorder-resources/" target="_blank">
          panic
         </a>
         , not any  current danger.
        </li>
        <li>
         Get out of bed, regroup, and orient yourself to the present.
        </li>
        <li>
         Try a pleasant and calming activity like taking a bath or listening to soothing music.
        </li>
        <li>
         If someone is awake, talk to them.
        </li>
        <li>
         Tell your doctor that you're having nightmares.
        </li>
       </ul>

        <strong>
         Difficulty falling - or staying - asleep:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Keep a regular bedtime schedule and routine.
        </li>
        <li>
         Avoid heavy exercise for a few hours before bed.
        </li>
        <li>
         Use your bed only for sex and sleeping.
        </li>
        <li>

        Recovering from PTSD is a gradual, ongoing process that can take many  months or years. The memories of the trauma will never disappear  completely, although in time they will become manageable. Here are some  ways to cope with residual complications from PTSD.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
        </strong>
        Remember that recovery is a process, not  an event, that happens gradually. Having an ongoing response to stress  is normal. Healing doesn't mean forgetting the event or removing all  pain while thinking about the event - healing means learning to cope  with the symptoms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Learning about trauma and PTSD in response  to a
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/trauma-resources" target="_blank">
         traumatic
        </a>
        event as well as some common signs and symptoms may help  you to realize you're not
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/loneliness-resources/" target="_blank">
         alone
        </a>
        , weak or crazy. It helps to know your  problem is something shared by many, many others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Find a "support partner," or a "spotter;" a person to willingly and
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/love-resources" target="_blank">
         lovingly
        </a>
        learn about your PTSD and will support you in whatever way you  need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes, relaxation techniques can be  helpful for people with PTSD. These activities include: muscle  relaxation exercises, breathing exercises, meditation, prayer, spending  time in nature, yoga, listening to quiet music. In others, however,  these may increase distress at first. If that happens, simply try  relaxation techniques for smaller periods of time, or mix them with  other activities like listening to music or walking.
        <strong>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The urge to pull back and
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/social-isolation-resources" target="_blank">
         isolate
        </a>
        is very strong for many who have PTSD. It's easy to feel disconnected  to everyone around you, withdrawing from loved ones and social  activities. It's very important to have support from others while you  recover, so resist the urge to isolate.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
        </strong>
        Find a support group for  people who have experienced similar types of trauma. Being  around people who understand what you are going through is priceless  when it comes to recovery. It can remind you that you are not alone and  provide you with invaluable information and tools for making a recovery  from PTSD. If there are no local support groups, try online.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't self-medicate - While you're struggling with  traumatic memories and painful emotions, the urge to use
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/alcoholism-resources-2" target="_blank">
         alcohol
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/substance-abuse-resources" target="_blank">
         drugs
        </a>
        to numb your emotions can be overwhelming. It's a temporary fix. And unfortunately,  these substances worsen PTSD in the long run, because they worsen symptoms  like emotional numbing,
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/social-isolation-resources" target="_blank">
         social isolation

        .

        Overcome helplessness -
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/trauma-resources" target="_blank">
         trauma
        </a>
        leaves you feeling  vulnerable and powerless. It's easy to forget that you do, in fact, have  both coping skills and strengths.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the best ways to overcome  these feelings is to
        <em>
         help
        </em>
        other people. Donate time, money, help  friends, or take other positive action. Taking positive action directly  refutes the feelings of helplessness common in PTSD. We'd love to have you volunteer with us - email

         in the world, post-traumatic stress disorder may be the most confusing one to understand - especially if you were witness to the same trauma as your loved one. Supporting your loved one who has PTSD is vital for their recovery.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: right;">
        <em>
         Here are some tips for helping a loved one cope with PTSD.
        </em>
        <strong>
         <br/>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Be patient and understanding - Recovery from PTSD  takes time - even if a person is actively trying to get better. Be  patient with the pace (slow as it may be) and offer a kind ear. Someone  with PTSD may need to talk about their trauma over and over - this is  part of the healing, and while it can be frustrating to hear, don't tell  your loved one to "move on," or "stop talking about it."
       </p>
       <p>
        Try to prepare for PTSD triggers - many people who  have PTSD will have triggers around the anniversary of the trauma,  certain sights, sounds, or smells. If you're aware of what these  triggers are, you can offer support and help to calm your loved one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Be there - sometimes the biggest help for someone  who is suffering from PTSD is to have a partner, friend, or other loved  one simply be there for them. Do simple favors.
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/love-resources" target="_blank">
         Offer unconditional  love
        </a>
        . Don't push. Simply be there for them.
       </p>

        Help
        <em>
         yourself

        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/anxiety-resources" target="_blank">

        for you, seek help for yourself. No one ever said  you had to go through this alone. Seeing a
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/therapy-resources" target="_blank">
         therapist
        </a>
        or attending a  support group yourself can ease the burden tremendously.
       </p>
       <p>
        Offer to help your loved one. Suggest bringing over some meals, or asking if they'd like a hand with some things around the house. Some people with PTSD don't feel as though they can ask for help.

         How NOT To Help A Loved One With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: right;">
        <em>
         Sometimes, even the most well-intentioned of us say or do the wrong thing. Here are some ways NOT to help a loved one with post-traumatic stress disorder:
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         PTSD is Not "In Their Head"
        </strong>
        - being the partner of   someone with an invisible illness can be very stressful. You may wonder   why they don't just "get over it." The thing is - PTSD is a real   illness, and your loved one may already feel as though they're going   crazy. Don't add to it by making your partner feel badly for having   these emotions or guilt them for "not getting over it." It's not as   simple as that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't Pressure - Sometimes, it can be very hard for  someone with PTSD  to talk about their trauma. For some people, it may  make the situation  worse. So never, ever force someone into discussing  their trauma.  Simply let them know that you are there if they'd like to  talk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't Take It Personally - Some of the more common  PTSD symptoms can hurt your feelings. These may include
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/anger-resources" target="_blank">
         anger
        </a>
        ,  withdrawal, and
        <a href="http://www.bandbacktogether.com/social-isolation-resources" target="_blank">
         social isolation
        </a>
        . If your loved one seems distant or irritable,  remember this probably has nothing to do with you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't imply that your loved one is being weak or silly for his or her PTSD. It's embarrassing and shameful enough to admit that you have PTSD - implying that your loved one is weak only intensifies the shame.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't imply that only soldiers have PTSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder can affect anyone, period.
       </p>
       <p>
        An experience doesn't have to match your definition of "extreme enough" for it to be PTSD. Don't downplay the experience to your loved one - it's unfair and inappropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't become frustrated when your loved one isn't "over it yet." It's not as though someone with PTSD doesn't want to be better - it's just not as simple as switching a light on or off.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: center;">
        <strong>
         What NOT To Say To Someone With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        "You're overreacting."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Stop being so dramatic."
       </p>
       <p>
        "You're being weak."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Relax and forget about it."
       </p>
       <p>
        "It's just for soldiers - you don't have PTSD."
       </p>
       <p>
        "You've been through so much already, how can this possibly have given you PTSD?"
       </p>
       <p>
        "Aren't you over it yet?"
       </p>
       <p>
        "Yeah, well, when So and So's kid got (insert traumatic event), he/she didn't have PTSD."
