         The Doctor Who Theme
        </h3>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
          the seminal (and now voted best ever Sci-Fi) television theme, composed by Ron Grainer and (originally) realised by
         <a href="/people/delia-derbyshire/">
          Delia Derbyshire
         </a>
         in the
         <em>
          <strong>
           BBC Radiophonic Workshop
          </strong>
         </em>
         (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         The story of the theme begins in June 1963. The idea of
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         had been around for over a year and three months since the programme had started some serious development. The then
         <strong>
          <em>
           BBC
          </em>
         </strong>
         staff producer\director Rex Tucker (who had been put in temporary charge of overseeing this new programme) had been working with composer Tristram Carey (on another series) and asked him if he would be interested in composing the theme for
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         But  by the middle of June 1963, the permanent producer for
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         had arrived. Her name was Verity Lambert.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a data-lightbox-type="image" data-uk-lightbox="on" href="/wnwpcontent/images/images/veritylambert.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
          <img alt="Verity Lambert" src="/wnwpcontent/images/images/veritylambert-small.jpg"/>
         </a>
         Lambert  still requiring theme music  thought of commissioning a theme from French avant-guard composers Jacques Lasry &amp; Bernard Baschet, otherwise known as
         <em>
          Les Structures Sonores
         </em>
         in mid-July 1963. They produced most of their music from elaborate custom-built metal and glass sculptures (sound-structures). Attempts were made to contact their agents but the idea was dropped by the end of the month.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         It was the head of the
         <strong>
          <em>
           BBCs
          </em>
         </strong>
         <em>
          Television Music
         </em>
         department, Lionel Salter, who suggested to Lambert that she meet with Desmond Briscoe of the
         <em>
          <strong>
           BBC Radiophonic Workshop
          </strong>
         </em>
          and thus the crucial connection was made.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lamberts meeting with Briscoe was sucessful, with the
         <em>
          Radiophonic Workshop
         </em>
         agreeing to work with Lamberts choice of outside composer on creating the theme music and also undertaking to provide special sound effects for the series on a regular basis.
         <a href="/people/delia-derbyshire/">
          Delia Derbyshire
         </a>
         was allocated the task (along with her assistant Dick Mills) of creating the theme music, composed by Steptoe &amp; Son theme composer Ron Grainer. Brian Hodgson was allocated the task of providing special sound for the series.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         Lamberts brief for
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         was that she wanted something with a beat, a radiophonic, familiar yet different sound. Ron Grainer composed the theme on a single sheet of A4 manuscript, and sent it over from his home in Portugal, leaving the
         <em>
          Workshop
         </em>
         to get on with it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Concious of the fact that the techniques to be used to realise the theme were very time-consuming, Ron Grainer provided a very simple composition  just the famous bass line and a swooping melody  there are few harmonic changes, and these are marked out almost entirely by the movement of the bass line, with only sparing use of inner harmony parts to reinforce where necessary. Any indication as to orchestration or timbre was simple but evocative: wind bubble, cloud and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
         To an inventive radiophonic composer such as
         <a href="/people/delia-derbyshire/">
          Delia Derbyshire
         </a>
         , this was a gift. Even so, Grainer harboured doubts as to whether all this could be achieved electronically (though that was always the intention) and kept in mind that it might be necessary overdub a small live instrumental ensemble (as with Giants of Steam) at the end.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         <a data-lightbox-type="image" data-uk-lightbox="on" href="/wnwpcontent/images/images/deliad.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right:10px;">
          <img alt="Delia Derbyshire" src="/wnwpcontent/images/images/deliad-small.jpg"/>
         </a>
         So, in August 1963, the original theme was generated by hand (by Delia and her assistant Dick Mills) using reel-to-reel tape machines, recording the sound of a plucked bass string and manipulating that recording (by speeding up, slowing down, reversing etc) to create the well-known bass-line track and using test oscillators  again recorded to tape  to generate the swooping and whooshing sounds.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The notes were individually recorded or manufactured, then cut to length (the longer the note, the longer the piece of tape) and then subsequently joined (spliced) together with sticky tape to create a tape loop, or tape reel. These loops (or reels) were then played on several tape recorders at the same time  in synchronisation  and recorded to yet another tape recorder. Thus the layers of sounds (now we call them tracks!) were built up to produce the finished mono master tape.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Any changes that needed to be made after the master tape was recorded (for example the sparklies of the Troughton era) were then constructed on a reel or loop of tape and then played in sequence with the master track, therefore effectively re-recording the master again, but with the extra effects. All of this was done in mono, using one or two track tapes and all timed completely by ear (and hand) as there were no computers or auto-timers in those days!
        </p>
        <p>
         The original August 1963 version of the theme was around 219 in length. It was licensed to
         <strong>
          Decca
         </strong>
         in 1964 for release as a single (Decca F.11837, 1964  backed by a popular dance tune of the 1950s,
         <em>
          This Cant be Love
         </em>
         , in a bizarre rendition by
         <strong>
          Brenda and Johnny
         </strong>
         ), and formed the basis of the 1972 stereo version released by
         <strong>
          <em>
           BBC Records
          </em>
         </strong>
         (see below). Everyone loved it, yet it was not destined for use on the programme.

          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         recording of any kind) was completed, Bernard Lodge (left) had completed the opening titles graphics. He had created an inventive swirl of howlaround (or howlround) images formed by feeding the output of a video camera optically back into itself via its own monitor  the visual equivalent of the high-pitched whine that results if you point a PA microphone at its own loudspeaker.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         The theme needed adjustments to match the graphics more closely, and the production team wanted a piece which gave a lot of flexibility as to use from one master tape. Lambert also wanted, it is said, some of the precision removed from the recording, to make it sound more human.
        </p>
        <p>
         In September 1963, a second master was prepared. A number of different versions of the theme are on this master tape, of which two are broadly similar. They feature an edited version of the theme running to about 115, followed by a repeated bassline loop running up to about 200, then the wind bubble to end. The rhythmic hissing that drives the track has also been altered (the main change being that it speeds up and fades out just after the entry of the melody before a brand-new loop reenters) and some deliberate imprecision has been introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of these two mixes, one is a good mix with good edits, and the other is a poor mix with some terrible edits. The pilot episode of
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         was recorded in Lime Grove Studio D on Friday 27 September 1963. And guess which edit of the theme they used?..they used the bad edit version on the pilot! You can hear one very poor edit just before the end of the melody before the bass loop takes over  the bass line sounds as if it is going into the bridge section, when in fact it goes back to a restatement of the opening melodic figure. The bass loop then carries on over the Policeman searching the junk yard and fades out as we see the
         <strong>
          TARDIS
         </strong>
         , before the wind bubble would have closed the track.

         Although the theme was added to and revamped many times over the first few years that
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         aired (1963 to 1980), the theme was essentially the same (give or take) master tapes put together by Delia in 1963. A few bits and bobs were added  noteably the sparklies at the beginning of the Patrick Troughton era (1967)  however, the theme stayed basically the same through the Pertwee and Baker eras.
        </p>
        <p>
         By December 1966, William Hartnells tenure as
         <strong>
          The Doctor
         </strong>
         had finished, and the first regeneration had occurred. Patrick Troughton was now
         <strong>
          The Doctor
         </strong>
         and it was decided to remake the opening titles introducing (for the first time) an image of
         <strong>
          The Doctors
         </strong>
         face into the sequence. The new titles debuted with episode 1 of
         <em>
          The Macra Terror
         </em>
         , transmitted in March 1967. At the same time, producer Innes Lloyd ordered a new version of the theme music to go with the new title sequence and Delia went to work:

          <img alt="Second Doctor Title Sequence" src="/wnwpcontent/images/images/troughtontitles-small.jpg"/>
         </a>
         What she produced was not a complete new mix, but a copy of the very first (August 1963  the good one) master with new elements overlaid. The main new element was some rising arpeggiated patterns (often referred to as spangles) over the introduction and main melody, but the entire piece was also re-equalised slightly, and a delay echo with feedback was added to the final mix to give the bass line (in particular) a slightly different feel.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         This new master recording is only 51 long  as only the opening was required in this new version. The music was married to the new titles, and debuted on Episode 2 of
         <em>
          The Faceless Ones
         </em>
         in April 1967.

         All change (sort of) three years later in 1970, when Patrick Troughton regenerated into Jon Pertwee (or is it the second Doctor into the Third?). Now in colour, a new set of the original black &amp; white howlaround titles were commissioned, in colour and with Pertwees face. To match these, another new version of the music was ordered, and on this occasion both titles and music would debut together, with episode 1 of
         <em>

         The differences to the opening titles music this time around include a short reverse-echoed stutter leading to the introduction, which is cut in half. This means that the main melody is quicker to start and the music moves to a repeat-to-fade ending which could be tailed out under the opening action of an episode  this was a big improvement on previous versions, which had just been faded out arbitrarily when finished with. The additional repeat echoes added to the overall mix, as on the 1967 version, are also heard here.

        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         This new 1969/70 version is a cleverly edited and further overdubbed version of the 1967 master  the theme is now a number of tape generations down from its original recording. The shortened introduction was created by doing a very clever (for 1969!) overlap edit. A very slight perceived doubling of the bass line over the bubble, and the way the cloud (the white noise whoosh) is at a lower level than on the 1967 version point to this, which of course saved having to go through the complicated remastering process that added the spangles in 1967 all over again. A little bit of additional white noise, and an extra spangle, were also added to help disguise the new edits.

The master was passed through some filtering and delay effects to give it a pseudo-stereo sound, the scream was added to the front, and the
         <strong>
          TARDIS
         </strong>
         was tracked in to take off in the middle. Various experiments were tried: for some mixes, the theme fades out to be replaced entirely by the

         in the middle, before returning and continuing to the end.

          The Electronic Scream:

        </p>
        <p>
         The electronic scream Tue, 14 Jul 2015 19:39:09 +0100 was originally introduced in 1970  initially as an experiment to add emphasis to the closing cliffhanger moment at the end of every
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         episode. The end credit music would also feature a closing wind bubble that made a finite end to the episode, instead of fading out (as it normally did). The scream was introduced in the third story of the 1970 season,
         <em>
          The Ambassadors of Death
         </em>
         . In fact there were several experiments tried in the 1970 season in an attempt to freshen the theme music (including the Delaware version) and various edits of the 1967 master versions, however none of the experiments (thankfully) passed muster, with the exception of the closing scream and wind bubble.

         </strong>
         Archivist Mark Ayres explains how the electronic scream effect was made by Delia:
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         The sound consists of two elements, a rising bubbling sound and a descending scream effect. First of all, lets deal with the rising bubbling sound. The process used to create this was very simple. The first couple of notes of the closing titles (as the theme melody enters) were copied onto a new piece of audio tape. This was leadered, then flipped over so that it played backwards. The output of the tape deck was then fed into a frequency shifter set for a downwards shift at a short delay, and fed back into itself. When the tape was played into the shifter, it came out the other end milliseconds later with its pitch shifted down slightly. This output was fed back to the input and so on, creating a downwards cascade of ever more distorted sound. This was copied onto a new tape, and when this piece of tape was in turn flipped over, Delia was left with a rising flood of sound starting very distorted and slowly resolving into the opening couple of notes  this was then spliced onto the beginning of the theme.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The downwards scream was created in similar fashion. The source sound is a downwards-sliding hard-edged tone produced using an audio oscillator. Again, this was fed into the pitch shifter with very short delay, a downwards shift, and heavy feedback. Aliasing distortion within the shifter added to the overall effect. The result was mixed with the rising echoes to give the sound we are all familiar with.

         From 1963 up to 1980, the Delia Derbyshire created theme tune for
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         had remained basically the same, with the 1969-1970 master tapes version lasting for over ten years. However, in 1980, the new producer of
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         (one John Nathan-Turner) ordered that the theme be revamped completely to bring it up to a more modern sound. He commissioned the
         <em>
          <strong>
           BBC Radiophonic Workshop
          </strong>
         </em>
         for the work and the task fell to
         <em>
          <strong>

          </strong>
         </em>
         composer Peter Howell.
        </p>
        <p>
         Howell took the music (but that was all) and completely re-recorded the theme from scratch using modern analogue synthesisers and the judicious use of the Roland SVC-350 Vocoder (a new acquisition at the time) to generate the updated theme.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         This was the first time the theme had been completely re-realised, losing all of Delias original sounds and tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Peter decided to start from scratch, wanting to produce a version for the 1980s that was as technically challenging as Delias had been for the 60s. Starting from Ron Grainers original score, he used a variety of techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bass line was created in a manner not totally removed from the original, with the sound, performed on Peters beloved Yamaha CS80 synthesiser, assembled across two tracks of multitrack tape. This finished part was then run off onto quarter-inch tape, flipped over, and rerecorded through effects onto another reel to give each note a subtle pre-echo. The final effect was dubbed back to the multitrack.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         Other instruments employed included the ARP Odyssey (used for the opening line of the melody), the EMS Vocoder (used to build the complex texture voicing the answering phrase in the main melody), and the Roland Jupiter 4 (set to auto-arpeggiate in octaves, it provided the sound for the middle eight). The chordal parts were created by layering the Jupiter 4 with the CS80.
        </p>
        <p>
         The recording opens with an explosive whoosh  a kind of higher-tech equivalent of the electronic scream introduced in 1970 and, again, the origins of this sound have been the subject of much discussion. Informed wisdom suggests that the opening flameup was created from a basic sample of a match being struck, the original sound being trimmed to remove the initial scrape of match against paper, leaving just the flare. This was heavily processed and combined with a synthesised roar. Nevertheless, while the match effect was a standard part of a series of lectures Peter gave a few years ago, he does not remember using it at all on this recording, although it does sound as if he might have done! An alternative explanation is that the sound was entirely synthesised  this view supported by a demonstration Peter once gave on a schools television programme, but in this case he was heavily simplifying the process, and may even have been playing a sample of the finished sound! In fact, Peter combined a processed recording of the downward glissando part of Delia Derbyshires electronic scream with some white noise (and/or the match flare!); the final effect was achieved by laying the combined sound to the multitrack tape machine running at 30 inches per second (the highest speed the machine would run at), then starting playback dead on the start of the sound. The doppler-like effect is the result of the machines motors starting up then settling down to the correct speed, playing back all the time.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         The closing explosion was a result of a little bit of serendipity. The original multitrack reel was, in common with most reels of tape at the time, being reused, its previous use being for one of Dudley Simpsons Doctor Who scores. Peter discovered, purely by accident, that a particular minute burst of sound, played backwards at a particular speed through some effects units, produced this very pleasing bang!
        </p>
        <p>
         Peter produced three different versions of the piece, taking six weeks work in total: opening, closing, and a full-length version for commercial release. The resulting master is undoubtedly the second most successful rendition of the theme after the original, and similarly defies many attempts to analyse exactly how parts of it were created  as Peter intended.

         The second half of S7 (or S33, if you prefer) during Matt Smiths tenure as the Eleventh Doctor, yielded a change in title sequence, along with a slight change in the theme music. Gone was the traditional time-tunnel effect, that had been used in some form or other since Tom Bakers tenure (with the exception of the TV Movie, of course) and was replaced with a planet and stars version, but this time featuring the face of the Eleventh Doctor  a feature that had yet to be seen since the series rest in 1989. Along with the new title sequence, the theme was altered slightly to enhance the bass line

         S8 (or S34), heralded a new Doctor in the guise of Peter Capaldi. The Twelfth Doctors title sequence is a new one (based on graphic designer Billy Hanshaws fan interpretation) and features a new rendition of the theme music.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         More aligned to the classic theme versions, this new version has restored the (sometimes) missing impact of the bass line and has dropped the counter melody in favour of a more electronic sound  and in keeping with the clock motif running through the title sequence, bells. Delightful!

         Recording The Doctor Who Theme

         We got a phone call from Verity Lambert, the first
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         producer, says Dick Mills. She said she had a little sci-fi series that would only run to six episodes, but shed like some special electronic effects. So me and Delia went along to Ealing for a meeting with her, and we said we could do the effects, but we could probably help out with a signature tune as well, as wed just been working with Ron Grainer  a composer who was coming quite into vogue.
        </p>
        <p>
         So Ron was hired to write the sig, and us to record it. Ron had originally come to us first, so we were returning the favour. Wed done a TV show called
         <strong>
          Giants of Steam
         </strong>
         and Ron had got us to make loops of train effects and process them to different tempos for his musicians to play along to. He had great confidence in us  for
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         , he just handed Delia one foolscap sheet of manuscript paper and said off you go! Then he cleared off to Portugal for a fortnight  he said it was for the sake of his health
        </p>
        <p>
         So how was the theme recorded? Well, we started with the bass line. You know those 19-inch jack-bay panels? You could get blank panels too, to fill in between them. They were slightly flexible, so Delia found one that made a good musical twang, and played it with her thumb. We recorded it then vari-speeded up and down to different pitches, copied them across to another tape recorder, then made hundreds of measured tape edits to give it the rhythm.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-alert" data-uk-alert="">
         And what was the main tune played on? Was it some early synthesizer? No, says Dick, it was just a load of oscillators  signal generators  that someone had connected to a little keyboard, one for each note. Again, we had to make lots of tape edits.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what about that distinctive portamento? How could you bend the notes like that without a synth? Dick sighs: Well you just twiddled the frequency knob, of course  how else? It was all done with actual knob-twiddling then  there was no other way! We did it in lots of little pieces, then joined all the bits of tape together.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eventually, after some pre-mixing, the elements of the entire composition existed on three separate reels of tape, which had to be run somehow together in sync. Crash-syncing the tape recorders was Delias speciality, says Dick. We had three big Phillips machines and she could get them all to run exactly together. Shed do: one, two, three, go!  start all three machines, then tweak until they were exactly in sync, just like multitrack. But with
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         we had a bum note somewhere and couldnt find it! It wasnt that a note was out of tune  there was just one little piece of tape too many, and it made the whole thing go out of sync. Eventually, after trying for ages, we completely unwound the three rolls of tape and ran them all side by side for miles  all the way down the big long corridor in Maida Vale. We compared all three, matching the edits, and eventually found the point where one tape got a bit longer. When we took that splice out it was back in sync, so we could mix it all down.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ron Grainer returned from his holiday and famously asked if it was the same piece of music that hed written. The theme was an instant success, as was the programme. But success brought its own problems, as Dick remembers. The trouble was, because it was a hit show, every producer wanted to put their stamp on it, so theyd ask us to record another version. We did loads and no-one ever liked them. One was laboriously done on the Delaware. The sounds were great, but no-one liked it. I remember Delia did one version herself, where there was very heavy tape echo on the rhythm that gave it a new and different groove. The first time it was played in a dub all the technicians complained. Oh no  whats wrong with that? they all said. Lets have the old one back! And we also had to make a 45-second version when the show got popular. Anyone whos worked in TV music knows how difficult it is to turn a 30-second sig tune into a 45  its a very unnatural thing to do, musically.

         As a footnote, there is still a difference of opinion on how the
         <strong>
          Doctor Who
         </strong>
         bass sound was created, 45 years ago. Dick Mills remembers Delia twanging a blanking panel in a rack, while Mark Ayres offered two versions  a plucked string and a rubber band (he heard both from Delia!). Peter Howell, meanwhile, told me: The bass twang was a plucked bass string on a home-made electric pickup device (a piece of wood with a string on it). That sound appears on several early
