  </p>
  <p>
   The Enterprise is en route to Penthara Four, 
where an asteroid impact has caused a dramatic 
drop in temperature on a global scale. They find 
a temporal distortion along the way, however, 
and are greeted by one Professor Berlingoff 
Rasmussen, a historian from the late 26th 
century!
  </p>
  <p>
   While his manner is at times irritating, 
Rasmussen's credentials are solid enough to 
Picard that he's willing to grant Rasmussen 
every courtesy, including filling out the 
questionnaires Rasmussen intends to distribute 
among the bridge crew. Rasmussen marvels over 
everything, from little details in Picard's ready 
room to Data, "the Model T of androids." 
However, he refuses to answer any question 
*about* the future, claiming that he doesn't 
want to influence the past, which is sensible 
enough.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the Enterprise reaches Penthara Four and 
prepares to trigger a greenhouse effect by 
drilling down to pockets of carbon dioxide in the 
crust of the planet, Rasmussen continues his 
study. Although he still says nothing, he more 
and more frequently drops hints that something 
big is going to happen that day-and even more 
peculiarly, seems to be surreptitiously pocketing 
items (a scanner, a tricorder, etc.). The phaser 
drilling begins, and is successful-the planet now 
has enough time to fix itself. Picard is pleased, 
and Rasmussen seems almost jubilant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rasmussen continues his enquiries, trying to 
win Troi's trust (an attempt which fails) and 
trying to romance Beverly (which also fails, 
when Beverly points out that she could easily be 
his "great, great, great, great...grandmother"). 
However, the bridge crew's slight annoyance at 
Rasmussen's attitude is swept away when a 
series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions 
begin rocking the planet below them-and all of 
them occur exactly where the drills were. 
Further, the volcanic ash being thrown up is 
compounding the problem, and before long the 
sunlight will be completely blocked, plunging the 
planet into an ice age. After some analysis, 
Geordi and Data come up with a plan with both 
good and bad aspects. The good news is that they 
can, in effect, turn the Enterprise into a 
"lightning rod" and sweep the dust away with an 
ionizing phaser blast into the upper atmosphere. 
The bad news is that the margin of error is very 
small-and if it isn't done just right, the entire 
atmosphere will burn off, killing every being on 
the planet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Picard, caught in a dilemma, turns to 
Rasmussen in the hope that he can point Picard 
the way. Rasmussen refuses, however, since 
anything he may say or do could end up altering 
Picard's choice, and thus his own history. Picard 
tries his best to persuade him otherwise, but to 
no avail. In the end, he decides to try Geordi's 
plan-and to his relief, it's successful.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rasmussen then prepares to leave, but is 
surprised to find the Enterprise crew blocking 
his way into his ship. It seems that they've 
noticed the various missing items, and want a 
look inside his ship for them. He initially 
refuses, but after it's pointing out that he'll 
never get in if they can't, agrees to let Data, and 
Data only (as Data can be ordered never to 
reveal any future secrets he sees) come inside to 
look. Data finds the items, but is threatened 
with a phaser by Rasmussen, who turns out not 
to be an historian from the future, but rather a 
disgruntled inventor from the PAST. He swiped 
the time pod from the real 26th-century 
historian who visited him several weeks "ago", 
and planned to take the items he stole back to 
his time and "invent" them over a few years. He 
now intends to take Data as well-but 
fortunately, the computer picked up the weapon 
when the door was opened and deactivated it. 
Data drags Rasmussen back out, and the now-
emptied time pod vanishes back to where it 
came, leaving Rasmussen to the mercy of 24th-
century historians who will, no doubt, be very 
interested in studying him.
