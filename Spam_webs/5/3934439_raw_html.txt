           Watchdog: Israel plans 261 settler homes deep in West Bank
          </b>
         </a>
         <br/>
         JERUSALEM (AFP) 22 Jan  Israel on Wednesday moved forward with plans for 261 new homes in two settlements located deep in the occupied West Bank, a watchdog said, drawing strong European condemnation. It was the fifth such move in just over two weeks and raised to 2,791 the number of new settler homes announced since the start of the year, threatening to derail faltering US-brokered peace talks with the Palestinians. Israels rapid settlement expansion has angered Palestinian negotiators and drawn condemnation from the international community, threatening peace talks that US Secretary of State John Kerry kick-started in July.
         <br/>
         EU envoy to Israel Lars Faaborg-Andersen said continued settlement building would isolate Israel, which he warned would be held accountable for a failure of peace talks  If the talks are wrecked as a result of Israeli settlement announcements, then the blame will be put squarely on Israels doorstep, he said. You are eating away at the cake that you are discussing how to slice up.

           Israel backs plans for 381 new settler homes

         </a>
         <br/>
         JERUSALEM (AFP) 21 Jan  Israels government has approved plans to build 381 new homes in a settlement near annexed East Jerusalem, settlement watchdog Peace Now said Tuesday. The Israeli civil administration, which falls under the defense ministry, has published plans for the construction of 381 extra units in
         <i>
          Givat Zeev
         </i>
         , said spokesman Lior Amihai, referring to a settlement just south of Ramallah. Peace Now said the new construction proved the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not serious about the two-state solution and that its actions are contradictory with the negotiations. It was the third such announcement in as many weeks, and followed Israels release on Dec. 31 of 26 veteran Palestinian prisoners, in accordance with commitments under the US-led peace talks.

The Palestinian News &amp; Info Agency (WAFA) said the shop that belongs to resident Salama Atallah Abu Zneid. He only received property destruction notices a few days ago. Media sources in the town said that the store is not only in the heart of the town, but also far away from Israels illegal settlements or any of its military camps. It stood on two dunams of land.

           Israeli police, inspectors storm home of Samir Issawi

         JERUSALEM (Maan) 21 Jan  Israeli police officers on Tuesday raided the
         <b>
          East Jerusalem
         </b>
         home of freed Palestinian prisoner Samir Issawi along with inspectors from the Jerusalem municipality. Issawis father told Maan that a large number of police officers and municipality inspectors broke into his home and took photos of both the interior and the exterior before they left. He pointed out that his two-story house was built in 1998 and that his family had previously paid a fine of 60,000 shekels ($17,200) for building it without a license. The family, he added, has been trying in vain for years to obtain a construction license. Issawis father added that he is worried that the Israeli municipality of Jerusalem might demolish the building and displace the 14 members of his family that live there. He added that an apartment belonging to the family was demolished in 2013, prior to completion.

           Israelis force bulldozer driver to damage road in Abu Dis

         JERUSALEM (Maan) 20 Jan  A Palestinian man whose bulldozer was seized by Israeli forces two weeks ago was forced to dig up a road in the village of
         <b>
          Abu Dis
         </b>
         in order to get it back, the man told Maan. A native of Eizariya village east of Jerusalem, Badr Dahdoul was removing roadblocks from a road near al-Quds University in Abu Dis two weeks ago when Israeli forces detained him and confiscated his bulldozer. The road had originally been closed by Israeli forces while they were demolishing a Palestinian house near the separation wall as it passes through Abu Dis. Dahdoul explained that he was taken into custody while removing the roadblocks and was ordered to pay a fine of 12,000 shekels ($3,400). On Sunday, Israeli authorities forced Dahdoul to damage the road with his bulldozer before they would agree to return it to him. Member of Abu Dis local council Abdul-Salam Ayyad, however, blamed Dahdoul for damaging the road.

         Since 1967, more than 800,000 olive trees have been uprooted in the occupied West Bank, resulting in a loss of around $55 million to the Palestinian economy, according to a report by the PA ministry and the Applied Research Institute Jerusalem. The olive industry supports the livelihoods of roughly 80,000 families in the occupied West Bank.

           Settlers sue Bedouin over outdoor oven fueled by livestock manure

         <br/>
         Haaretz 20 Jan by Amira Hass  Judge says Israel ought to grant retroactive building permit for taboun, which Bedouin say is 20 years old  A couple from the settlement of
         <i>
          Carmel
         </i>
         in the South Hebron Hills is suing the adjacent Bedouin community, Umm el Kheir, for 100,000 shekels ($28,650) in damages, for the damage and aggravation they say has been caused them by a taboun oven for baking bread. The couple, Yaakov and Bareket Goldstein, are also asking the Jerusalem Magistrates Court to order the destruction of the oven, which is used by dozens of people. The couple, aged 30 and 28, moved to their home in Carmel in 2008. They argue that a number of years ago the Bedouin residents of
         <b>
          Umm el Kheir
         </b>
         trespassed on state land some 50 meters from their home and built a large stone structure with inner ceramic walls. The couple says that because livestock manure is used to keep the oven lit constantly, the awful smell reaches their home and those of their neighbors and disturbs them and their four children. The Palestinian residents of Umm el Kheir have been living in the region since the 1960s on land they purchased from residents of Yatta. They belong to the Hadalin tribe that Israel expelled from Tel Arad in the early 1950s. The Carmel settlement was built near Umm el Kheir in 1981 and has gradually expanded  Residents of Umm el-Kheir claim that the oven has been there for 20 years, and the demolition order was issued only after a new settler neighborhood was built nearby  settlers have twice raided the Umm el Kheir camp and poured buckets of water on the taboun to shut it down.

         JERUSALEM (Maan) 22 Jan  Israeli excavations at the entrance to Wadi Hilweh in the Silwan neighborhood are destroying deep-rooted Islamic antiquities from the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphate eras, says a Palestinian Jerusalem-based group. The Al-Aqsa Foundation for Endowment and Heritage highlighted in a statement that previous excavations adjacent to the area had demolished an Islamic cemetery from the Abbasid era. The Israeli occupation has started new excavations carried out by the so-called Israel Antiquities Authority and funded by Gilad Organization which supports settlements. The excavations are on Palestinian lands the Israeli occupation confiscated and has been used as a parking lot for visitors of the settlement outpost called the City of David, the statement said. Israeli archaeologists from the Emek Shaveh organization confirmed that there were Islamic antiquities in the area being excavated, according to the statement. The excavations, according to the foundation, lay the grounds for construction of a giant 8-floor Jewish center to be called the Biblical Temple. It will serve as a main entrance to the tunnel network which Israel has excavated under Silwan and under the Western Wall of the al-Aqsa compound, it says.

         [with VIDEO] Implications of Israel-imposed seclusion of Gaza Strip on Palestinians right to family life  HaMoked &amp; BTselem January 2014  After the 1967 occupation, Israel enabled Palestinians to travel relatively freely between the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel. Residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip who married Israeli citizens or Israeli residents (i.e., East Jerusalem Palestinians with Israeli ID cards) could receive permanent residential status in Israel through the family unification process. This policy facilitated the renewal of family ties and the creation of new ties of marriage, work, etc. However, once the first intifada began in late 1987, Israel started imposing restrictions on the freedom of movement of West Bank and Gaza Palestinians. At present, it is practically impossible for Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza. There is also absolutely no possibility for Gaza residents to receive official status in Israel or East Jerusalem and live there with a local spouse. Israels restrictions on entering and exiting Gaza sentence family members to separation, and force mixed Gaza-West Bank or Gaza-Israel couples to live without a normal routine, governed by a host of bureaucratic constraints. Tens of thousands of people must live with this impossible reality in which the state infringes on the most intimate aspects of their lives through many procedures with strict criteria that are virtually impossible to meet.

Eyewitnesses told Maan that clashes began after Israeli soldiers positioned themselves in front of the main entrance to the university and began stopping students and asking for their identity cards. Israeli forces then began firing multiple tear gas canisters onto the campus, causing students to retaliate by throwing stones. Soldiers then breached the perimeter of the university campus and continued to fire tear gas and rubber bullets at students. Witnesses said Israeli forces in full riot gear were seen on campus and the Red Crescent set up an area to treat wounded students. This is more major than anything last year or the year before, a witness told Maan, adding that the only way to leave the university was to cross the line of fire of Israeli soldiers. A popular committee spokesman told Maan that over 100 Palestinians, including university students, faculty, and staff, suffered from excessive tear gas inhalation. Others were injured by rubber-coated steel bullets, said Hani Halabiya.

The march in Jiftlik was organized in protest against a legislation bill recently approved in the Knesset to annex the Jordan Valley to the current state of Israel. While the Israeli government declares that the move is purely for security reasons, the large number of illegal agricultural settlements and theft of Palestinian water rights demonstrate that the motives are largely economic  Approximately 60 people gathered in the Jordan Valley and began a protest holding banners and chanting against the Israeli occupation of Palestine. As the march ended, Israeli forces invaded the area and began to arrest Palestinian demonstrators. Sven W and a British volunteer succeeded in stopping the detention of a Palestinian youth and in the process were both arrested by the Israeliarmy. The two international activists were violently pushed to the ground by an Israeli soldier and handcuffed. The British activist managed to escape detention, whilst Sven was blindfolded and forced to kneel on the ground. One Israeli soldier purposefully pushed Svens face in dirty water before taking him behind a military jeep and repeatedly kicking him in the ribs. Ahmad was also beaten after his arrest and received injuries to his knee. The British activist received a similar assault before escaping detention. When Sven is deported this week, he will be the third international activist in less than two weeks to be arrested and deported by Israeli forces. Vincent Mainville and Fabio Theodule were arrested on the 8th January and deported a week later.

In the meanwhile two Palestinian shepherds, accompanied by three OD volunteers, were grazing their sheep in this area. At 1.14 pm the shepherds left for their homes and encountered another group of five settlers. After one minute Israeli soldiers arrived, telling the settlers to move away and declaring the area a closed military zone. Subsequently arriving to the area were an additional nine settlers, several Palestinians and Israeli activists, the Israeli police, Border Police and officials from the District Coordination Office (DCO). Once the Israeli forces start to push the people away from the area the shepherd, Mfaddi Ahmed Rabai, refused to leave the area, claiming his right to remain on his own land. While a policeman and a group of soldiers tried to arrest him, he collapsed on the ground. At 13.43 the Israeli army forced everyone to leave the area.

         <br/>
         GAZA CITY (Maan) 22 Jan  Hamas recently contacted officials in the Islamic Jihad movement to ensure the group observed the terms of a ceasefire agreement brokered by Egypt in November 2012. Jihad spokesperson Daoud Shihab told Maan that Gaza prime minister Ismail Haniyeh telephoned Islamic Jihad secretary-general Ramadan Abdullah Shallah and his deputy Ziad al-Nakhalah to ensure the group maintained the ceasefire. Egyptian officials have also been in contact with senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials concerning ceasefire arrangements, Shihab said. Israel gives itself the right to intervene in the Gaza Strip and take action against any resistance fighter, which is an attempt to disavow the ceasefire agreement of 2012, Shihab added. Palestinian factions are not interested in escalation, but if Israel insists and continues with targeted assassinations, they have to bear the consequences, the Islamic Jihad official said. An Israeli airstrike on Wednesday killed two Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip.

Samahna and other activists were hiding in an orange grove (when) Israeli forces attacked them, Shtayyeh said. Israeli military helicopters started to bombard the grove from all directions. Ata Samahna was killed immediately by a direct hit.

         RAMALLAH (WAFA) 22 Jan  A prisoner arrested in 2003 and serving a 14-year sentence may lose his leg, if not his life, if not given proper treatment, the Palestinian Prisoner Club said Wednesday. It said in a statement that Mohammed al-Sayareh was also diagnosed with cancer, which may lead to his death. Sayarehs health is extremely difficult as he is suffering from enlarged blood vessels since 2004 and a leg injury caused during interrogation in 2003, said the Prisoner Club.It said a lawyer for the Prisoner Club who visited Sayareh at his detention in the Naqab desert said that according to initial diagnosis, the disease could lead to the spread of cancer and the amputation of a leg in the event treatment was not given to him in time. The lawyer said that the prisoner must buy medicine from his own pocket worth over $1000 a month. In addition, he requires special food also at his own cost. If Sayareh, from the village of Kharas in the Hebron area, has to undergo surgery, it would cost him at least $30,000, said the Club, which his family cannot afford.

Nasser al-Najjar told Maan that 15 people, including three children, left the coastal enclave via the Erez Crossing to visit 11 Palestinians detained in Israeli jails. There are around 5,000 Palestinians being detained in Israeli prisons and detention centers, according to Addameer.

         NABLUS (Maan) 22 Jan Hamas-affiliated lawmaker Sheikh Yasser Mansour entered his sixth day on hunger strike Wednesday to protest being detained without trial by Israel since November 2012. Yasser Mansour started hunger strike action on Friday in Israels Negev prison and is also refusing to take medicine, his brother Samir told Maan. Mansour, 47, was detained on Nov. 24, 2012, after Israeli forces raided his home in Nablus. He has served two six month terms of administrative detention and a third term was recently renewed by Israeli authorities. Mansour is a member of the inactive Palestinian Legislative Council, representing Hamas. Israel is currently holding over 140 Palestinians in administrative detention, a procedure which allows Israeli authorities to hold detainees indefinitely on secret information without trial or charge.

           Syrian army slows Yarmouk food aid to a trickle

         </a>
         <br/>
         Electronic Intifada 22 Jan by Ali Abunimah  An eyewitness told The Electronic Intifada that distribution of relief supplies in recent days has been extremely slow as a result of a time-consuming process of identification and list-checking by government forces at the distribution point. On 18 and 20 January, for instance, numerous civilians were turned away and only a fraction of the available relief was distributed each day. On 21 January, according to the eyewitness, UNRWA staff arrived at the northern Batikha entrance of Yarmouk before 11 AM. At 11:30, the team was permitted by government forces to enter the camp under the same government clearances that had allowed access for UNRWA staff on 18 and 20 January. UNRWA brought several dozen food parcels and other supplies to the to the Sama Street distribution point, approximately one kilometer south of the Batikha entrance and about 100 meters north of the front line. However, the distribution of the supplies was delayed for several hours by Syrian government forces as nine civilians were being evacuated. Finally the distrubution began at 2:45PM, but was again interrupted when an injured Palestinian man unsuccessfully tried to seek clearance to leave Yarmouk. Distribution then resumed, but at 4:45PM government forces shut the process down. By the end of the day, only about two dozen food parcels had been distributed in total and the UNRWA team left. The reason the distribution was so slow is that that military personnel would only allow food parcels to be given to people whose name is on a list of 5,000 Yarmouk residents supplied to it by a Palestinian charity. Any other civilians approaching the distribution area seeking food were turned away.

         BETHLEHEM (Maan) 20 Jan  Palestinian popular resistance activists removed Israeli flags from two Israeli bypass roads near Bethlehem on Monday morning as part of a new nonviolent campaign to resist settlements. Activists targeted bypass roads in two areas near the Israeli settlements of

         , east of Bethlehem, and

         bloc west of Bethlehem. Coordinator for the popular resistance committee against the wall and settlements in Bethlehem Mohammad Brejia said the action was a part of activists plan to make 2014 the year of resisting settlements and settlers. Coordinator for the resistance of settlements Hassan Brejia said that such actions emphasize our commitment to our land and rights and our rejection of the expansion of settlements as well as settler attacks. In 2014, we will be moving forward to make settlers feel unsafe on Palestinian land, roads and streets within the 1967 borders, he added. Settlement bypass roads are Israeli-only roads that connect Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank to each other as well as to Israel proper. These roads limit Palestinian entrance and usage through a number of means, including checkpoints and physical obstructions that prevent travel into or out of Palestinian areas but facilitate movement between Israeli settlements.

Norways prime minister is expected to make first visit to Israel this year  Despite calls made in recent years in Norway  inter alia among local artists  to boycott Israel, the new Norwegian Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey said: We dont see the boycott as an effective tool to promote positive change. The Norwegian government is interested in tighter cultural relations between the two countries. I am certain that a deeper mutual understanding is a prerequisite for achieving progress on political matters. Last week, Widvey opened a conference for Norwegian television producers, which was dedicated to the success of the Israeli television industry in exporting drama series.

         GAZA CITY (Maan) 21 Jan  Two Fatah-affiliated lawmakers who fled the Gaza Strip in 2007 returned to the coastal enclave on Tuesday in a sign of warming relations between the two main Palestinian factions. Hundreds of Fatah supporters gathered near Erez crossing to welcome Majid Abu Shammalah and Alaa Yaghi, two elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council representing the Fatah movement. The lawmakers crossed the border escorted by senior Fatah official Sufyan Abu Zaydah, and it was the first time that they had returned to the Gaza Strip since clashes between Fatah and Hamas across Palestine drove them out in 2007. Since 2007, the two have been living in Ramallah in the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank. Their return to Gaza is part of a series of good will gestures by Hamas-run Gaza Strip government premier Ismail Haniyeh to enhance reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, which leads the Palestinian Authority. Hamas deputy foreign minister Ghazi Hamad was at the reception near Erez crossing along with Fatah lawmaker Ashraf Jumaa.

The bills sponsor, MK Basel Ghattas (Balad), said it aims to address the problem that many Arab localities lack street names. Ghattas said the many nameless streets in more than 95 percent of Arab towns and villages nationwide make it difficult for residents to receive mail and other services, and for ambulances and fire fighters to respond to distress calls. He also said Arab community residents spend NIS 20 million a year on cellular phone calls to Bezeq technicians to guild them to their homes, which have no clear address.

         Haaretz 21 Jan by Amos Harel  As of Monday evening, Israeli security forces have yet to discern the source of a
         <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.569609" target="_blank">
          series of explosions
         </a>
         heard near the southern port city of Eilat. Judging by the force of the explosions, the most logical assumption is that they were caused by two Katyusha rockets landing in open areas near the city. It seems that the rockets were fired from the Sinai Peninsula by one of the global jihad-affiliated factions, many of which also have ties to Al-Qaida. What still remains unclear is the context of this attack: Is it a by-product of the ongoing struggle between Egyptian security forces and militant groups in Sinai? Or was the attack a response to a different conflict, the dispute that Gazas Palestinians have with Israel and Egypt?  Israel has less information about these new players in the world of terrorism, in comparison to the stores of data it has on organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. Second, its difficult to strike back at those who carry out such attacks, because even if their identities become known, they generally do not have any camps out in the open, nor any other infrastructure that can be targeted openly; and in any case, Israel would find it difficult to operate on Egyptian soil.

           Israel busts East Jerusalem Qaeda cell

         <br/>
         JERUSALEM (AFP) 23 Jan  Israel has arrested an al-Qaeda-run militant cell in annexed East Jerusalem which was planning to bomb the US embassy, a spokesman for the Israeli prime ministers office said on Wednesday. The US State Department said it had been in touch with the Israeli authorities about the alleged plot but was not able to corroborate it independently  In a joint operation, the Shin Bet and Jerusalem police uncovered a global jihad group from east Jerusalem which was operated from the Gaza Strip with the aim of carrying out major terror attacks in Israel, a Shin Bet statement said. It said the attacks the group were plotting included bombing the US embassy in Tel Aviv, a double suicide bombing at Jerusalems International Convention Center, a kidnapping of soldiers from the citys central bus station and a bombing of a block of flats. Two of the suspects  Iyad Abu Sara and Rubin Abu Nagma, both in their early 20s  were from East Jerusalem, while the third  Alaa Anas, in his early 30s  was from Jenin in the northern West Bank, it said.

         <br/>
         BETHLEHEM (Maan) 20 Jan  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited Bethlehem and Ramallah on Monday as part of a four-day visit to the Holy Land. Harper met with President Abbas in Ramallah, where he was received in an official ceremony. Abbas and Harper inspected the honor guard as delegations from both sides met. A Canadian business delegation accompanied Harper and will meet with their Palestinian counterparts to discuss join ventures and investments, official news agency Wafa reported. It is expected that Harper will pledge over $60 million to support the Palestinian private sector. Earlier, Harpers visit to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem was mired in controversy as local journalists claimed that the premiers bodyguards assaulted them as they tried to cover his visit  The Palestinian Union of Journalists said that one journalist was punched in the face and Amir Hijazi, who works for a local TV station, was hit with a metal object.

         </a>
         . Their sons, Tariq and Muhammad, were killed in 2007 as a result of the divisions between
         <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/tags/fatah">
          Fatah

         , the faction of Palestinian Authority leader

         <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/tags/hamas">
          Hamas
         </a>
         . In 2006 and 2007, following Hamas victory in January 2006 legislative elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Fatah leaders and their international supporters were

         , armed clashes led to the deaths of dozens of supporters of each group. In June 2007,

          fearing a US-sponsored coup by forces loyal to Abbas
         </a>
         , Hamas drove Fatah forces out of Gaza. Abbas, in turn, accused Hamas of carrying out a coup. Both mothers want the rival parties to patch up their differences. Years after Tariqs death, my grief remains the same, al-Najjar, a Fatah supporter, said. We are all doubtful that they will reach an agreement as this is not the first time they have claimed to be getting near to one, she added. Yet we are hopeful they will make it eventually.  One factor that may make the current effort more credible in some eyes is that Hamas feels more isolated than ever in Gaza, as the Egyptian military regime which

         , breaking many bones. Only six months after he was shot, the scars were miraculously hard to see. The space between the soldiers and me was ten meters, the Palestinian photographer and filmmaker said. One of them shouted at me and I didnt hear him, so I took the camera down and asked him what he said. Dont take pictures and go inside. Usually I dont listen to them  but this time, I didnt argue, I just said okay. I closed the window and went to close the door of the balcony, and as I was trying to close it I saw a flash, moved my face to the left and was shot through here. The 23-year-old Palestinian is from the Aida refugee camp near

Soon after he began, Mohammad realized that photography could be his form of resistance to the occupation  As a young, largely self-taught media maker, al-Azza has created a large body of work focusing on life in Palestine and especially in Aida camp. His photographs and films have been shown internationally, spreading a glimpse of life in Palestine from Palestinian eyes. The Electronic Intifada caught up with al-Azza in Boston in October, where his photographs were on display at Tufts University and his film

One of the foremost objectives of Canadian aid for the PA is the establishment of a security force in the West Bank that is both complicit in settlement activity, and active in quelling popular dissent among the restive West Bank Palestinian population. Canada has also deployed soldiers, RCMP and various other state officials to the West Bank, as part of

         <br/>
         CBCnews 20 Jan  An Arab-Israeli legislator who stormed out during Prime Minister Stephen Harpers speech to the Knesset on Monday says he did so as a form of protest against Harpers bias. Speaking to Evan Solomon, host of CBC News Networks Power &amp; Politics, Ahmad Tibi said Harpers speech was biased and that he described Israel in a very unbalanced way. [Links to: Watch and read Stephen Harpers Knesset speech; Stephen Harper vows loyalty to Israel in speech to Knesset; Stephen Harper in Israel gets the red-carpet treatment] We are 20 per cent of the population, we are suffering discrimination, Tibi told Solomon. That democracy of Israel is a selective democracy, ethnic democracy. Canada is a democracy and people are equal without relation to their ethnic background. Here, theres a problem with that, he said  Canadas foreign policy toward Israel is biased, non-balanced, and thats why Canada has a very marginal role in the Middle East, Tibi said  Harper was speaking out against what he says is a more subtle form of anti-Semitism than what the world saw ahead of the Holocaust. Some civil-society leaders today call for a boycott of Israel. Most disgracefully of all, some openly call Israel an apartheid state. Think about that. Think about the twisted logic and outright malice behind that, Harper said.

                 The US State Department will say, It is not helpful. And that is all.

                 In other words, keep building.

                 The US is already paying for this big time in lost standing, influence and opportunities. In the near future the cost to the US  economically, politically  will reach a point of no salvation. Israel and the US, hitched together will be paying for this for generations.

               Sorry this newslist is so long today  unavoidably, its a day late, and that means even more events to report.
               <br/>
               Id like to ask how many readers would like to have bare-bones reports on the West Bank-wide daily arrests  perhaps just 15 Palestinians were kidnapped today in the following villages: A, B, C rather than the detailed reports IMEMC puts out for each day that I now include. Some stories, like the arrests of children, released prisoners, relatives of prisoners and lawmakers, etc. and detentions involving injuries, would remain the same.

                 Hi Kate,
                </p>
                <p>
                 A) Please dont ever apologize,
                 <em>
                  especially
                 </em>
                 for the length of the lists. Its just not your fault.
                </p>
                <p>
                 B) Daily litanies of what Israel does to the Palestinians are very effective. It enables discussions to start downstream of the initial isolated event and/or not really so bad IRoW-argumentation or noob-disbelief steps (But did you know that just today).
                </p>
                <p>
                 C) It is completely unfair for me to say this, and its not criticism at all As you spit-balled, a summary section of standard categories at the head end of these lists would amplify the impact of the actual lists. A reader could whet their curiosity/outrage with the aggregated events and then connect the details. I think it would be compelling, but I cant imagine how much extra work that would be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the extra work vein, I cant help now, but after mid-September maybe so. Counts, names, locations, maybe maps (I like maps) and pix. You know, grunt work, not brain work. Annie has my email.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thanks for your great efforts.

               ritzl  Thanks back at you! I bet youd be a great help. We can talk about it after September.

               There already exists a kind of bare-bones list, put out most days by the Palestinian Monitoring Group of the Negotiations Affairs Department of the PLO. It has some things that I dont cover, like flying checkpoints and Wall construction. Starts out with loads of statistics, and has some details on subsequent pages. I find that the .pdf file takes an inordinate amount of time (minutes!) to load past the first two pages, though. Here is an example:
               <a href="http://www.nad-plo.org/userfiles/file/pmg-reports/dailyr/PMG.Daily.Sitrep.22.01.14.pdf" rel="nofollow">
                link to nad-plo.org
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Leslie Bravery of New Zealand also has a daily list, which I think is at least partly taken from the PLO list. Example for 21 January:
              </p>
              <p>
               Israeli drone strike kills 2 and damages homes
               <br/>
               Occupation settlers plunder Red Cross-funded olive seedlings
               <br/>
               Zionist fanatics damage olive trees and spray-paint racist graffiti
               <br/>
               Israeli soldiers destroy Palestinian villagers home
               <br/>
               Israeli soldiers abduct 3 minors aged 14 to 16
               <br/>
               Night peace disruption and/or home invasions in 12 towns and villages 1 drone strike  34 raids including home invasions  2 dead  3 injured
               <br/>
               3 acts of agricultural/economic sabotage
               <br/>
               16 taken prisoner  11 detained  111 restrictions of movement
