       In a historically close race, Gore edged out Bush in the popular vote 48.4 percent to 47.9 percent. However, Bush won the majority of electoral votes, 271 to 266, because of Bush's victory in Florida, winning its 25 electoral votes that both candidates desperately needed. The race in Florida was so close that state law required a recount of the ballots. There were, however, thousands of thrown out ballots that were discredited because the counting machines could not discern them. After the machine recounts still showed Bush ahead, Gore asked for a hand recount of ballots in counties that favored Democrats. On November 26th, Florida officials certified that Bush won the state of Florida by 537 votes. Gore conceded December 13th.

       In foreign and security areas, his terms included the 9-11 terrorist attack, the passage of the PATRIOT Act, the invasion of Afghanistan (2001-present) and Iraq (2003-present), the expansion of NATO to the Russian border, financial aid to fight disease (especially AIDS) in Africa, and improved relations with India.

Liberals criticized his handling of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina relief, and the dismissals of U.S. Attorneys for political reasons.

      Although the attacks may have been an attempt from Al-Qaeda to divide the United States, they were unsuccessful. Across the nation, Americans had donated blood and raised money for reconstruction in New York City. Within weeks, Americans had raised over one billion dollars.

       Afghanistan housed and protected al-Qaeda as it planned the 9-11 attacks.  It then refused to turn over al-Qaeda leaders. With UN and NATO approval, Bush went to war to overthrow the Taliban. On October 7th, 2001, he ordered bombing of al-Qaeda's camps and the
       <a href="/Taliban" title="Taliban">
        Taliban
       </a>
       's military forces in Afghanistan. "We will not waver, we will not tire, we will not falter, we will not fail, freedom will prevail", President Bush explained. The attack quickly shattered the
       <a href="/Taliban" title="Taliban">
        Taliban
       </a>
       's defenses, and by early December the Taliban regime had collapsed. The United States, its allies and the UN then helped Afghanistan create a new government under

Security Council approved a resolution that demanded Saddam Hussein declare all of it's WMD's, stop supporting terrorism and oppressing his people, Congress authorized the use of military force against Iraq.

       On January 23, 2007 President Bush ordered an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out.

       , George W. Bush said "I wouldn't be president." "It was just a conversation," said the younger Bush about a talk with Graham in the mid-'80s that changed his life. During the pivotal conversation Bush recalled saying, "'You know, Billy, I'm longing for something.' And I know that he sent me a Bible I still have. All I can tell you is that as a result of being inspired by Billy Graham, I started reading the Bible and shortly after, I quit drinking."

       .
Asked about creation and evolution, Bush said: "I think you can have both. I think evolution can -- you're getting me way out of my lane here. I'm just a simple president. But it's, I think that God created the earth, created the world; I think the creation of the world is so mysterious it requires something as large as an almighty and I don't think it's incompatible with the scientific proof that there is evolution."

        This evening, my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this house  September 11, 2001.  That morning, terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor.  I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center three days later, surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke-filled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93.  I remember Arlene Howard, who gave me her fallen sons police shield as a reminder of all that was lost.  And I still carry his badge.

       <b>
        As the years passed, most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before Nine-Eleven.  But I never did.  Every morning, I received a briefing on the threats to our Nation.  And I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Over the past seven years, a new Department of Homeland Security has been created.  The military, the intelligence community, and the FBI have been transformed.  Our Nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists movements, freeze their finances, and break up their plots.  And with strong allies at our side, we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored al Qaeda and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school.  Iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United States.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions.  But there can be little debate about the results.  America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil.  This is a tribute to those who toil day and night to keep us safe  law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, homeland security and diplomatic personnel, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Our Nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger.  I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families.  America owes you a debt of gratitude.  And to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight:  There has been no higher honor than serving as your Commander in Chief.

        The battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems.  Under one, a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology, condemns women to subservience, and marks unbelievers for murder.  The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God and that liberty and justice light the path to peace.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This is the belief that gave birth to our Nation.  And in the long run, advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens.  When people live in freedom, they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror.  When people have hope in the future, they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism.
       </b>
      </p>

       <b>
        So around the world, America is promoting human liberty, human rights, and human dignity.  We are standing with dissidents and young democracies, providing AIDS medicine to bring dying patients back to life, and sparing mothers and babies from malaria.  And this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        For eight years, we have also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home.  Across our country, students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools.  A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled.  Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes.
       </b>
      </p>

       <b>
        The addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faith-based programs.  Vulnerable human life is better protected.  Funding for our veterans has nearly doubled.  Americas air, water, and lands are measurably cleaner.  And the Federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When challenges to our prosperity emerged, we rose to meet them.  Facing the prospect of a financial collapse, we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy.  These are very tough times for hardworking families, but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted.  All Americans are in this together.  And together, with determination and hard work, we will restore our economy to the path of growth.  We will show the world once again the resilience of Americas free enterprise system.
       </b>

      <p>
       <b>
        Like all who have held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks.  There are things I would do differently if given the chance.  Yet I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind.  I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right.  You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made.  But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        While our Nation is safer than it was seven years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack.  Our enemies are patient and determined to strike again.  America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict.  But we have been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them.  We must resist complacency.  We must keep our resolve.  And we must never let down our guard.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        At the same time, we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose.  In the face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward.  But we must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism.  Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger.  In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad.  If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will not be led.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        As we address these challenges  and others we cannot foresee tonight  America must maintain our moral clarity.  I have often spoken to you about good and evil.  This has made some uncomfortable.  But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise.  Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right.  This Nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth.  We must always be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace.

        President Thomas Jefferson once wrote, I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.  As I leave the house he occupied two centuries ago, I share that optimism.  America is a young country, full of vitality, constantly growing and renewing itself.  And even in the toughest times, we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead.

We see it in Julio Medina, a former inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to society.  We see it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade, who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow Marines.

       <b>
        We see Americas character in Bill Krissoff, a surgeon from California. His son Nathan, a Marine, gave his life in Iraq.  When I met Dr. Krissoff and his family, he delivered some surprising news:  He told me he wanted to join the Navy Medical Corps in honor of his son.  This good man was 60 years old  18 years above the age limit.

        But his petition for a waiver was granted, and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine.  Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight, because he will soon deploy to Iraq, where he will help save Americas wounded warriors and uphold the legacy of his fallen son.

        In citizens like these, we see the best of our country  resilient and hopeful, caring and strong.  These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America.
