      Over the coming weeks, I'll be giving you a wealth of information about numerology (all completely free of charge!). I look forward to taking the journey with you. Numerology is a true passion of mine, and it is my hope that you find numerology to be just as fascinating as I do!
     </p>
     <p>
      Ok, let's jump right in to analyzing your numerology chart! The best place to start is with one of the most basic calculations

     <h3>
      Your Life Path Number
     </h3>
     <p>
      Your Life Path (based on your birth date of January 6, 1940) is 12. It is calculated in 4 steps:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <span class="purple">
        Add up the digits in your year of birth:
       </span>
       <br/>
       Your year of birth is 1940. Adding 1 + 9 + 4 + 0  gives us
       <span class="calculation-result">
        14
       </span>
       . Adding 1 + 4  gives us
       <span class="calculation-result">
        5
       </span>
       .
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="purple">
        Add up the digits in your day of birth (if more than one digit):
       </span>
       <br/>
       Your day of birth is the 6. As
       <span class="calculation-result">
        6
       </span>
       is a single digit, there's nothing to add here..
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="purple">
        Add up the digits in your month of birth (if more than one digit):
       </span>
       <br/>
       Your month of birth is January, which is the 1th month. As
       <span class="calculation-result">
        1
       </span>
       is a single digit, there's nothing to add here..
      </li>
      <li>
       <span class="purple">
        Add up the answers from (1), (2), and (3) above:
       </span>
       <br/>
       The totals, then, are 
                      5,  
                      1, and 
                        6                        . To get our final answer, we add these three numbers together to give us 12: Adding 1 + 2  gives us
       <span class="calculation-result">
        3
       </span>
       .

     <h3>
      What Your 3 Life Path Says About You...
     </h3>
     <div class="clearfix">
      <div class="col fl">
       <p>
        The number 3 Life Path usually includes one other person that is with you or is a heavy influence on you for your entire life. You might have a tendency to see your lover and yourself as one soul or one person....
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        You are creative, expressive and blessed with some type of talent that is guaranteed to
put you in the spotlight at least once in your life.  You have an upbeat personality and
others find you easy to identify with. You also have the potential to become the symbol
for an entire culture or generation. Many beloved entertainers, columnists, movie stars
and inspirational leaders in the world are number 3's.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your creative and performing talents are also augmented by your astounding ability to 
understand and empathize with others. You are the number that knows how to "give the people 
what they want." For this reason many of you also end up in sales or advertising as your 
innate charm enables you to "sell ice to an Eskimo."
       </p>
       <p>
        You often rise to the top of any career that you choose but the old cliche "it's lonely 
at the top" also applies to you. This is because threes are often fated to be loved by 
many but not by one special other. However most as most 3's are naturally philanthropic 
and giving of their hearts, many are quite satisfied with the mass attention and social 
popularity that is often part of their life path.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, the highest attainment of your life path is the polishing and perfecting of your 
talent and sharing it with the world. Unfortunately as you do so you may find yourself 
leaving a lot of broken hearts along the way. A challenge for many 3's is also not to 
become too jaded about love.
       </p>
      </div>

       <img alt="" class="fr" height="510" src="/media/low-priced-reports/dnr/img/life-path1.jpg" width="460"/>

     </div>
     <!-- end clearfix -->
     <div class="clearfix">
      <figure>
       <img alt="" class="fl" height="700" src="/media/low-priced-reports/dnr/img/life-path2.jpg" width="460"/>
      </figure>
      <div class="col fr">
       <p>
        As you are very independent and light on your feet you may have a problem finding a 
life partner that understands your ambitions or that is willing to share you with so 
many other people. Even if you don't achieve fame, 3's tend to be at the very center 
of their community and enjoy a thriving social and love life. In fact having too many 
romances during one lifetime is very characteristic of a 3.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you always put talent or career first you might also find yourself to be the odd 
person out in a number of love triangles during your life. Usually this is because a 
career calling forces a 3 to abandon a partner who cannot keep up with them. Sometimes 
their fast-paced lifestyle does not offer them the time to cultivate a relationship. 
For this reason you also might find your relationships to be more unorthodox than others 
might; finding soul mates who are already attached or that are much older or much younger 
than you.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you have a very spiritually sophisticated view of life you embrace change without 
the fear that is experienced by most of the other numbers. Often this causes you hardships 
financially, as you are the number that is most willing to gamble or take a big risk to 
launch a new project.
       </p>
       <p>
        You are capable of making large amounts of money, but also capable of spending it all just 
as fast.  As you are not very materially minded you are not necessarily concerned about this 
but your carefree attitude about money often alarms your family and business associates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your tendency to live for today and not for tomorrow is a blessing as well as curse 
for you as you journey along your life path. The drawback of this is that you are 
easily distracted from your responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rare number three that is not successful in life has probably lost his or her focus.
The positive aspect of this tendency to live in the here and now is that you rapidly 
bounce back from any type of misfortune and like a chameleon have an uncanny ability 
to reinvent yourself throughout your life time.

        In practice, I put the vowels above the name and the consonants underneath. This is because your Soul Urge is derived from the vowels alone, so it makes it easier during the next step to do it this way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again there is one exception to the rule and this is with the letter Y. If it acts as a consonant and is pronounced it is classed as being a consonant. If it is not pronounced or acts as a vowel it is classed as being a vowel. The Y in Yolande, for instance, would be classed as being a consonant, but the Y in Larry would be classed as being a vowel as it acts as a vowel.

      Lets work out your Expression number, graham...
     </p>
     <p>
      Using the above chart we would put a '7' below the 'G' in your first name. We would follow this with a             9 placed below the 'r', then a             1 above the 'a', a             8 below the 'h', and so on...
     </p>
     <p>
      We then carry on in the same manner with the rest of your name. When you are finished, you should end up with a chart like this:

     <h3>
      What Your 11 Expression Says About You...
     </h3>

      <div class="col fl">
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        You are a master number, which means that you are more concerned with ideals and ethics, 
rather than practical or materialistic issues. Your preoccupation with the divine can 
sometimes make you appear a bit bizarre or spacey to others. However as you are usually 
recognized as a genius from a very young age, your personal quirks are often forgiven.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your exceptional intelligence and ability to spend hours by yourself was probably noticed 
when you were a young child. As an adult your probably still spend a great deal of time 
alone in the world of your incredible imagination. Your verbal and written skills are 
excellent and you have a keen analytical mind.  Your brilliance often allows you to 
achieve scholastic excellence. You have many of the aspects of the other numbers and could 
be a great teacher, inventor, scientist or artist.  However many of you choose a more off 
beat path in life as it is learning about the odd or the exceptional that excites you the 
most.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the greatest achievement for your number is in the mastery of some kind of spiritual 
practice occult science. You are incredibly intuitive and many of you practice some form of 
divination. You may experience mysterious connections to others as well as prophetic dreams. 
As you are so intelligent, sometimes your curiosity leads you down taboo or forbidden paths. 
As you were so smart as a child you may have been left out of normal social groups. This 
makes you more vulnerable than other numbers to joining a cult or being influenced by a 
religious leader.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes you are also a very defensive person as you bitterly resent those who don't 
understand you or can't keep up with you. Being left out of things can become a chronic 
pattern for you if you are not careful. Some elevens feel so powerless in social situations 
that they are tempted to use metaphysical means to gain power over others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given all of your talents, it is paramount that you use your powers for good. Your keen 
perception of others and analytical abilities often give you a natural edge over others 
when it comes to professional relationships. However in personal relationships, elevens 
often appear emotionally detached to loved ones who feel manipulated by them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many elevens are so eccentric that they can't hold down a job. In most of these cases 
however they seem to find someone to take care of them so they can pursue their mental 
and creative interests.

        You have the potential to thrive in the business world but you probably prefer a more 
unconventional lifestyle that gives you the room to explore your various interests. 
Travel and history are two subjects that greatly interest you and you feel spiritually 
recharged when visiting a holy or mystical place in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you are so brilliant you can also appear as a bit too eccentric to others. This may 
express it self in your manner of dress or where you live. As you think in the long term 
the future of humanity is always on your mind so you are thrifty with your resources and 
probably active in some kind of charity or ecological organization.
       </p>
       <p>
        You are capable of being a good parent but as you see relationships as a process, as 
opposed to a goal, you may opt to have several "soul mates" during your life. It is 
often an eleven who is the parent of several children by different spouses. However 
you are a good provider and excel at managing an extended family.

     <h3>
      Your Soul Urge Number
     </h3>
     <p>
      Your Soul Urge, also called your Hearts Desire, is a reflection of what you desire to be, to have, and to do in your life, graham.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your Soul Urge is calculated by adding up all the numbers corresponding to the vowels in your full birth name. Using the cart above, youd add up all the numbers in the top row.
     </p>
     <p>
      The top row: 1 + 1 + 6 + 9 = 17. Therefore, graham,
      <span>
       your Soul Urge is a 8.

      What Your 8 Soul Urge Says About You...

       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        You are one of the most spiritual complex and misunderstood numbers. Your ability to 
create wealth often fills your life with difficult relationships. Others may try to take 
advantage of you or try to make you feel guilty for your success. You are probably used 
to being described as greedy or shallow but usually the opposite is true. Often your 
devotion to keeping the free exchange of money flowing costs you dearly personally either 
through overwork or thanklessness from others.
       </p>
       <p>
        In essence your number is about exchange - the exchange of things for profit. Although 
you are materially oriented you are not spiritually bereft. In fact, one of your most 
sophisticated spiritual qualities is your belief that all should wealthy and that all 
should benefit from your endeavors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The highest expression of your soul urge number is when you are at the top of the food 
chain and dispensing goodies down to those who work for you or love you. You are a very 
trustworthy individual who is entrusted often with the task of caring completely for other 
people's livelihoods. This is a huge responsibility and many simply don't understand the 
challenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        You are blessed with the tools that come in hand with being a great leader - foresight, 
analytical abilities and a great understanding of human nature. Your ability to sell ice 
to an Eskimo comes from a truly grounded and practical understanding of the wants and needs 
of humans. You are very astute when it comes to choosing partners and employees. You always 
assign people to roles that best suit their talents and resources and so that all benefit 
from your grand plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Usually it is an eight that facilitates the building of a church, day care center or 
opera house. Art and the theater truly do appeal to your brilliant mind. Many of you are 
excellent when it comes to choosing talent and putting it to work in your organization. 
You may also privately support an artist that you believe is adding beauty, meaning and 
order to the world.

       <p>
        Another soul energy that drives you is your need to demonstrate the circulation of love 
and prosperity in your life. If you are not making money, it seems to you like you are 
not being favored by the Gods or that you are on the wrong path. Like feng shui masters, 
you see the circulation of wealth in your life as evidence that love is blossoming in 
your life as well. This is because you are as equally concerned with attaining spiritual 
riches as you are material riches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of you are natural born feng shui masters and have innate understanding of the use 
of space. For you beauty is a matter of form following function, so if it is useful it 
is beautiful to you. This is why many eights end up funding the design of grand buildings 
or malls or creating large corporations or organizations. In Biblical terms, you are the 
one who knows how to divide up a single fish to feed thousands.
       </p>
       <p>
        You are also an extraordinarily kind person and one of your challenges may be about 
deciding who is a good risk to lend money to or not.  For this reason, you can always 
expect some losses in your life due to the lending of money. If you are stolen from, your 
highest spiritual calling is to forgive the debt and realize that others simply don't have 
the same natural knack for creating wealth that you do.

      Over ten years ago my fiance Wendy dragged me out of the house to meet a master numerologist visiting our town, Christchurch, in New Zealand. Back then I didnt think much of numerology, and neither did my scientist colleagues, especially Iron-head John. However, numbers always fascinated me so I decided to listen to what the mysterious numerologist had to say.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       graham, I was stunned! Listen to the story he told me:

     </p>

      Did you know a man named Wu of Hsia has discovered an ancient tortoise shell from China with very unusual writing on it?

        Numerology is perhaps
        <span>
         the oldest science known to man
        </span>
        . It is based on real numbers and mathematical principles that are predictable in nature. Thats why Pythagoras (one of the greatest mathematicians in history and someone you may remember from high school geometry) studied it so intensely! Pythagoras is known as the father of numerology because of the great advancements he made in the science more than
        <span>
         2,700 years ago.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, there have been many more advancements in mathematics, and with it, in the science of numerology. Youll be amazed to discover how many things in the universe can be explained by a mathematical formula. Numbers govern much if not most of what happens in your life, relationships, health, and finances. By just knowing your name and date of birth, I can tell you things about yourself, your relationships, and even your future that will blow your mind...
       </p>
       <p>
        <span>
         And for the next hour, he did blow my mind.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Since that day, my life, health, finances, and relationships have completely turned around from being miserable to everything I always dreamed them to be! Now, I live in a beautiful home, with a loving family, in great health, and no worries. I even discovered my
        <span>
         true destiny!

      The master numerologist took me under his wing and, I soon discovered I could predict major events and turning points in peoples lives with laser-like precision... I was able to create a "road map" for people's lives that left their jaw hanging open in astonishment ... I was able to glimpse into a person's very soul to find out what they held dearest and, to help them get more of what they most wanted out of life! I realized helping people this way is my true purpose in life.
     </p>
     <p>
      At first, my scientist colleague Iron-head John ridiculed me day after day as I intensely studied numerology. He was a skeptic, just like I was before I started my amazing journey of discovery. But once he saw the accuracy of my predictions and his life began changing dramatically better from my readings, Iron-head John, like many of my scientist colleagues, transformed from a non-believer to a numerology fanatic! (His wife did too since I helped save their marriage)!

        FREE Report #1: Why Your Phone Number Can Skyrocket (Or Ruin) Your Career
       </h4>
       <p>
        Did you know that your telephone number, home address, even the number of a hotel room you stay in effects your life  for better or worse? Numbers affect everything in your life, especially the numbers closest to you. And the digits in your phone number are very tied to your everyday identity and life. They are a gateway of communication between you and the people you love and work with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youll discover specifically how your phone number is influencing your career, since it can really make or break you. For example, we recently knew a travel agent who couldnt get her business to work. She did everything she could and she couldnt figure out what was going wrong. After she followed what she learned in this report, she decided to change her phone number. Guess what? Her travel business instantly turned around! Dont overlook the power of these numbers in your life!

        FREE Report #5: The Wardrobe Secret That Transforms Bad Days Into Great Days
       </h4>

        <span>
         Did you know you can turn a bad day into a great day by simply adding one color to your wardrobe?
        </span>
        Its true. Try it out yourself tomorrow. But heres the catch: the same color wont work everyday! Not at all. You need to know what color the day requires. Luckily, this is easy. All you have to do is know your daily power number!
       </p>
       <p>
        You see, there is an energy that surrounds you and, this energy is largely influenced by your
        <span>
         daily power number
        </span>
        . Knowing it, you will anticipate in advance pleasant and difficult days in your future. And since every daily power number has a positive color associated with it, you can drastically improve you day by adding this color to it!
       </p>
       <p>
        This report tells you your daily power numbers along with their corresponding colors. So take out your calendar, because the daily power number will be the most important thing youll write in it! And if you are planning an event or activity, such as a job interview, date, party, home repair, or buying or selling a house or car, this is especially essential!

       FREE Report #6: The 1-Minute Relationship Forecast
      </h4>
      <p>
       <span>
        If you have one-minute, you can predict the future of any relationship!
       </span>
       Heres how: over the course of your life, you go through 9-year cycles. These cycles affect everything in your life and you can quickly determine which cycle you or anyone else are in (be it your lover, friend, family member, partner, boss, or coworker). All you need is the exact day and year of the persons last birthday. Why is this important? Because knowing the cycle you and someone else are in will tell you where your relationship with that person is heading!
      </p>
      <div class="col fl">
       <p>
        For example, some cycles push you and your friends apart through distance and work, while others bring you back through reunions. Likewise, differences in your and your lovers cycle will
        <span>
         signal times of problems and growth
        </span>
        . If either of you are in the 2, 4, 6 or 11 energy cycle, this is a particularly good time for growth. But if you are in a 5 and your lover in a 6, be prepared to have problems. However, in this report, youll find out how to
        <span>
         stop cycle clashes
        </span>
        and have great relationships all the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plus, depending on the cycle you are in, this year may or may NOT be the best time to start a new project, job, business or relationship, have a child, write a book, complete something youve started, move into a new home or redecorate, learn a new skill, art or language, or many other things. Youll know once you read this report.

       The Bottom Line:
      </span>
      People typically pay me hundreds of dollars for everything Im offering to you today for only $67. This information has already changed the lives of thousands of people all over the world (and Im not even talking about the celebrities and politicians, but regular everyday people). Ive had people go from financial troubles to financial success, doubling and tripling their incomes in little time...
     </p>
     <p>
      Ive had people come to me with health concerns and have not only regained their well-being, but also their youth and energy and quality of life (some even into their eighties and nineties)...
     </p>
     <p>
      And Ive had couples on the brink of divorce now living the happiest, romantic, and richly-fulfilling relationships I know of...
