       "It's 7 to 
            8 feet tall, covered in red-brown fur. And it's smelly."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The 
            above quote is from the Naples, Florida Daily News dated September 5, 
            1999, and is attributed to Dave Shealy. Shealy is the owner of Big Cypress 
            Trail Lakes Campground where the Skunk Ape has been sighted. He also 
            runs the only Skunk Ape research center in Florida. In fact, Shealy's 
            the one who fist used the term "Skunk Ape" because, he says, 
            of the animal's foul smell. Shealy has been attempting to bring attention 
            to the existence of this strange creature and has had some success, 
            including the filming of a reenactment of the Skunk Ape encounter by 
        "Unsolved Mysteries."

       The Skunk Ape may 
            be America's southernmost Sasquatch - or it could be another creature 
            entirely. Like the Sasquatch, the Skunk Ape seems to crave its privacy, 
            and what better place to hide out than in the Florida Everglades? Who 
            knows what strange creatures may lurk in the mysterious depth of the 
            Florida swamps?

      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
       But the Skunk Ape 
            has been sighted many times and in many places across the State of Florida. 
            With sightings reported every week, how can anyone believe the creature 
            doesn't exist or even that it is a hoax?

       In February of 2001, 
            the Sarasota Sheriff's Department Received an anonymous letter containing 
            some photographs that purported to be of the Skunk Ape. The woman who 
            wrote the letter was concerned because she believed there was an orangutan 
            loose in the area. She was worried about her family and also concerned 
            that the animal might get on the highway and cause an accident.
      </font>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
       The photographs 
            sparked an investigation, newspapers and other media picked up the story 
            and it even aired on the Art Bell show.
       <br/>
       <em>
        (The photographs reported as Myakka ape turned out to be nothing more than an Asian made costume)
       </em>
      </font>

     <p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
       Does the creature 
            exist? The law apparently thinks it does.

       This is from Associated Press, 
      October 1977:

     <p>
      <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
       "TALLAHASSEE, 
                FL. (AP) A bill making it illegal to molest a Skunk Ape has been 
                passed by a legislative committee as a lawmaker renews his effort 
                to protect the legendary anthropoid. The Criminal Justice Committee 
                passed the bill (HB58) by Rep. Paul Nuckolls, R-Fort Myers, Tuesday 
                after Nuckolls unveiled it for the second year in a row. Last session, 
                the bill passed committee but never reached the floor."
