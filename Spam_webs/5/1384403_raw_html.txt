     here is no one who loves a proverb better than does the native of Madagascar.

From the thousands in use he is always sure to be able to select one

appropriate for the moment, whether he be sending his friends to ask the hand

of his bride-to-be, or gathering his relatives around his deathbed, or merely

bargaining for his piece of beef in the market place. Above all, when he

becomes a Christian and speaks in church or prayer meeting, his proverbs come

to his aid so easily and aptly that the young missionary is often ashamed to

follow him with the most carefully prepared of sermons. Many of these proverbs

have been handed down from the days when all life in Madagascar was very

primitive. Some of them depend for their meaning upon beliefs and customs that

no longer exist. Yet in comparing a collection of them with our own proverbs

one is as surprised at the likenesses as at the differences.
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Malagasy have a 'Don't be a crowing hen' proverb, but they say nothing

about whistling girls. They have also 'Don't kick a sleeping dog' and 'Don't

take another mouthful until you have swallowed what is in your mouth,' which

have a familiar ring. The rolling stone, in Madagascar, is famed not for

gathering no moss, but because 'it never stops till it reaches the bottom.'

This saying is used when a native is shaking his head in sad doubt as to the

conduct of another. The pot that calls the kettle black is there only a

dangerous companion: 'Those who are near the pot get black.' A dog's bark may

be worse than his bite, but the native is wise enough to remark of it, 'The

dog's bark, it is n't might, but fright.' In Madagascar the love of money is

not called the root of all evil; it is 'the tail of witchcraft'! There is a

'fish that got away' proverb, but it goes further: 'An eel not caught is as big

as your thigh; a hill not seen is like calamity.' 'In union there is strength'

appears there, most fittingly, in the form, 'Cross in a crowd and the crocodile

won't eat you,' and in 'Men are like the rim of a pot and one all round,' and

the more homely but very characteristic saying, 'One finger can't catch a

louse.'
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand there are many which we can appreciate, but which have no

English or American cousins: 'Cleansing others, but wasting away in the

process, like soap'; 'Poverty won't allow him to lift up his head; dignity

won't allow him to bow it down'; 'To be two things like a bat: flying it's a

bird, resting it's a mouse'; 'Not knowing what to do, like the stepchild: if he

does n't wash his hands he is called dirty, if he does he is wasting the

water'; 'Guilt repented of becomes righteousness, but righteousness boasted of

becomes the grandfather of guilt'; 'The end of an ox is beef, and the end of a

lie is exposure.'
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Long before Madagascar natives came into contact with Christian missionaries

they had a number of what we should call good Christian proverbs. 'Don't think

yourself hidden in the silent valley, for God is overhead' employs the term

Andriamanitra, literally 'the fragrant sovereign,' a name which in the old days

meant a supernatural ruler, or a deceased king who had come to be regarded as

divine. Andriamanitra is now used by the Christian natives as one of the names

for our God. Before the arrival of missionaries the Malagasy did not worship

Andriamanitra, but one can have no doubt, after becoming familiar with their

proverbs, that they attributed to him many qualities which show him to be the

same omniscient Judge. 'Better be guilty with man than guilty with God'; 'God

hates evil'; 'An axe with a notched edge: if the people don't notice it the

tree will'; 'One is blessed by man and the other is blessed by God.' Our 'Don't

count your chickens before they are hatched' has been said by the Malagasy:

'Don't decide before God, like the hatcher of fowls.'
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Others could not be transplanted so easily into our own soil. There is one

which says, 'The earth is God's chief wife; she maintains the living and guards

the dead.' This refers to the days when polygamy was practised more generally

in Madagascar than it is to-day. The first, or chief, wife had the care of the

property and added to it as often as she could. Another says, 'The dead are not

buried on Thursdays or Sundays, because the living are considered.' That is

because Thursday and Sunday are unlucky days, and it is believed even yet in

some parts of the island that a funeral on either of those days will soon be

followed by many more funerals. The custom of wearing a lamba or sort of shawl

has given rise to 'When God has made a plain face, covering the head won't make

it handsome.' Another, which might well be remembered, but is n't always, when

they are dealing with unsuspecting foreigners, is 'The simple are not cheated,

because God is feared.' Perhaps the foreigner is not regarded as simple, but as

fair game, no matter how little he may know of the island and of its scale of

prices. Another, which should have more general application than it has, is

'when the day is dark a light can be used; when the water is deep a canoe can

be used; when the moat is deep a ladder can be used; but there is nothing that

can be done for an evil deed.' The little American boy might say that in his

Sunday school!
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      They speak lightly of the diviner, who, nevertheless, still makes his living in

all parts of Madagascar. 'Mr. Headshaker's prediction: if it is n't a boy it

will be a girl' is reminiscent of an American doctor who made his position

equally sure by finding out in advance which the parents wanted and then

prophesying that it would be the other. If he was right they did not complain,

and if they got what they wanted they did not complain.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      'Sorrow I can bear, but not the professional mourner' has more sophistication

than we should expect from the gentle savage. So also has 'A hard old woman who

is not made compassionate by the past.' 'A cow is ill, and a bull is the

doctor's fee' sounds like a bitter jest that might have been applied to an

American lawyer. To be philosophical does not necessarily mean to have had a

formal education. The Malagasy says, 'A wife to be divorced has many faults, a

lass not married looks excellent, a woman not yet made a mother-in-law seems

easy to get along with.' The poor mother-in-law gets the worst of it in

whatever civilization she may find herself! There must be universal truth in 'A

tall tree is hated by the wind, and a rich man by his neighbors,' but one would

dislike having to live next to the man who says, 'When there is a rice field to

be dug I call in others; when there is salted eel for dinner I have no friends

but the dead,' or to be engaged to the one who says, 'Marriage is not a fast

knot, but a slip knot.'
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Here is a new way of saying 'David and Jonathan': 'Let your friendship be that

of the mouth and the hand: if the hand is hurt the mouth blows it, if the mouth

is hurt the hand strokes it.' Then there are 'Don't love me as you do a door,

liked, but pushed to and fro,' and 'Don't be so much in love that you can't

tell when the rain is coming,' which latter could easily be listed among our

own proverbs, if it is not already one of them.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Studying the proverbs of a people, the common sayings of their everyday life,

and the philosophy of their more serious moments, one comes to a close

understanding of that people. The Malagasy show depths of feeling, as in

'Sorrow is like a precious treasure: shown only to friends,' and 'I am deserted

by you when I am not yet recovered, and yearning for you is two thirds of my

malady,' and true nicety in 'Let your love be like the misty rain, coming

softly, but flooding the river'; but in the long run the spirit of the tropics

wins out and 'Love is like young rice: transplanted, still it grows' and as for

life, 'Life is a shadow and a mist; it passes quickly by and is no more.'
