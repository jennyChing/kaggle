Angie created Angies List in 1995 and it has since blossomed into a resource that collects about 40,000 reviews a month from more than 2 million paid households in 200-plus cities across the United States and Canada.

        </p>
        <p>
         Being prepared and calling the right department.
        </p>
        <p>
         Start with the customer service department if you must, but if you want the best deal  and youre a good customer  you want to save your serious negotiation for the customer retention department. Customer service folks have standing incentives to keep you on the membership rolls and that first offer might sound like a great deal. Dont be fooled. The best incentives are hoarded by the retention department. But dont go in unarmed. And from there, you should also be sure to:
        </p>
        <p>
         Know your contract: Understand what youve signed up for, so you can negotiate out of it. Have your contract with you when you approach the company and quote from it to bolster your position  especially if you didnt get all the service the contract promised, if you had outages or problems.
        </p>
        <p>
         Know when your contract expires: Too many of us dont remember when our contracts are due. Renewal time is the best time to negotiate your terms..
        </p>
        <p>
         Shop the competition: Determine what other providers are offering and use that as leverage. Even if you have to pay a termination fee, you may be able to save overall by jumping ship. Remember: you can walk away from your current company. Be prepared to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dont take the first heres what I can do for you offer: There are tons of great deals out there. Dont get dazzled by the first offer. You can usually get much more than just a free phone, and you want to get the best deal you can.

        <p>
         Negotiate your bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most people dont realize that your cell phone plan can be negotiated like any other purchase. Cell phone companies have the ability to offer even better plans than the ones listed on their website, especially if youve been a long-time customer. Call the customer service number associated with your plan and tell them youre trying to lower your phone bill and were wondering if they have any discounts to offer. Most of the time they will comp your texting plan or offer you a $10-$20 statement credit.

         The MobileVoip app then allows me to place a call using a call back (or direct VOIP service) and thereby no longer requires me to purchase a large number of minutes, in fact, all I need is a small data bundle in order to set up the calls.

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Shop around and consider your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example Verizon Wireless might be the most expensivebut they might have coverage in your area only.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next is to ask for discounts. Did you know that many wireless companies provide large discounts for those who are active duty military, in education, and many other things?
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally the best option is to break up with your contract. These days there are several reliable services where you can receive an unlimited plan for $45 a month! (Its truejust check out Walmart Family Mobile) you might find that even by terminating your current contract you will make up the cost within a matter of a few months.

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Switching to a prepaid plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         I currently use a Verizon prepaid plan and every month, its always $65 without any surprises and thats with taxes included. Unlimited talk and text and 2 GB of data: its 3G but who really cares? I deliberately chose 2 GB of data which I never use anyway because I dont want to be one of those people whose face is buried in the phone 24 hours a day checking emails, checking the web etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are plans that are even cheaper and with some as low as $40 a month with other carriers that but I wanted to go with a reliable carrier and after having tried with the others, theres no doubt that Verizon is the most reliable. I travel a lot and I cant afford to have dropped calls.
        </p>
        <p>
         I still prefer to do everything on my laptop when it comes to cell phones, prepaid plans make a lot more sense now and youre not locked into any contracts. If at any point you become dissatisfied with the service and/or plan, youre free to leave.

         <strong>
          An ideal way to save money on phone bills when it comes to cell phones is to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Actively cut down on your monthly data usage.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reason cell phone bills have skyrocketed is because the data plans tend to be very expensive. If you sign up for the cheapest plan (whether family or individual) and limit data
         <br/>
         usage to WiFi only, you can end up saving a bundle!
        </p>
        <p>
         When you are not within public WiFi look for other hotspots before using your data. Sign up for text or email alerts through your cell phone provider to notify you when you are reaching your data limit so you dont get a surprise overage charge.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you have a large family, another way to save on your cell phone bill is to cash in on family plans that offer discounted rates for stringing multiple lines.

          The best way to save money on your cell phone bill is to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Make sure that your plan does not involve a subsidized device.
        </p>
        <p>
         Plans that draw your focus to a free or discounted phone always will build the cost of that device into your monthly bill. Even though you are saving money initially on the phone, you are paying full retail for it over the course of your contract.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new plans such as AT&amp;T Next are no better, because then you are still paying for the cost of the device in full, or you give it back to them after 12 months, and lose the potential resale value of the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Worse yet, plans with a subsidized device will involve early termination fees if you want to leave your current carrier. This potential cost can be avoided by bringing your own device on to a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, you will not have to pay a device activation fee, which can be up to around $40, when you do not purchase a new device through your current carrier. Bringing your own device is always a cheaper option when you view the total cost of owning the phone over a 24-month period.

          to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Sign up with a non-major cell phone provider such as T-Mobile, Cricket or Metro PCS that offers no contract and unlimited data, talk, and text messages and purchasing only the features you need.
        </p>
        <p>
         It can be difficult choosing a cell phone provider with so many options available from dozens of companies. Many subscribers go over their plans minutes for text and talk every month and having unlimited service would save subscribers tons of money each month. Sometimes I go over my talk and text minutes and get upset when I see the bill. The next month I am watching my minutes like a hawk because I dont want to pay any more money than I already do each month to my cell phone provider. Switching to a non-major provider and choosing a plan carefully is a great way to get your monthly cell phone charges under control.

          One way a family can save a serious amount of cash on their cell phone bill
          <br/>
          each month is by
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Using services such as PagePlus.com, PagePlusDirect.com, and Ting.com.
        </p>
        <p>
         PagePlus.com is a company that sells prepaid phone plans, but uses the Verizon network for service. Compared to Verizons standard rates, PagePlus.coms prices are very competitive. For example, with PagePlus you can get a plan with unlimited talk, unlimited text, and 1 GB of data for just $39.95, while on Verizon, the same plan would cost you $60. The trade off using PagePlus as opposed to Verizon is that their service does not yet have 4G service (but will be soon). If you dont mind the lack of 4G for now, you can also use any existing Verizon phone to use their service or you could even buy cheap Android-based phones from them as well. If you dont mind the lack of 4G and want to save money then this is definitely the route to go.
        </p>
        <p>
         PagePlusDirect is a similar service to PagePlus.com except that by registering on it as a wholesaler, you are able to save from 6% to 12% on the regular PagePlus rates depending on how many dollars worth of credits you by in advance. The other difference is that with PagePlus.com you can pay using a credit card, while PagePlusDirect can only be used when linking your bank account to the service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ting.com is a similar service to PagePlus.com, but for the Sprint network, The selection of phones that they provide are of good quality and inexpensive; not to mention they offer family shared plans (PagePlus.com does not). All in all a great service for those who want to save big when using the Sprint network.

         Incorporate a prepaid phone into our usage.
        </p>
        <p>
         While my husband and I have unlimited talk, text, and data with our phones, we find that its less expensive for our son to have a prepaid plan. He uses fewer minutes, and doesnt need all of the extras. By using a prepaid phone for our son, instead of upgrading to a family plan that includes him, we save about $60 per month. We may have to re-evaluate this system as he grows, but right now, as a preteen, he doesnt need anything else.

        <p>
         Cancel the carrier insurance plan and self-insure your device.
        </p>
        <p>
         These plans are expensive and if you do the math, with the deductible, (usually $150 -$200 + 10 monthly), after a year you could almost buy a new phone.
        </p>
        <p>
         The #2 way to save on your bill is renegotiating with retention, but you must KNOW your numbers and really be willing to cancel/switch services. Carriers begin making money on you in about month 18 and are terrified of you leaving because it costs so much to gain a customer.

          The #1 way to save money on your cell phone bill each month is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Eliminating the non-essentials.
        </p>
        <p>
         Believe it or not, the first non-essential is the contract. Ditch the contract. Call and ask when your contract is up. They will tell you how soon you can upgrade. Stop upgrading as soon as an upgrade is available. Generally, there are two to four months remaining on your contract when they allow you to upgrade. If you upgrade, they have just locked you in for another two years. Plus, some cell phone providers have begun outright charging for your new phone with anytime upgrade plans.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once your contract is up, keep using your phone until it dies. When you need a new phone, buy a last years model from a phone store  online or brick and mortar. Keep your service contract-free.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another non-essential may be Internet Sharing or whatever your modem or hotspot feature is called. There are too many free wi-fi locations for the average, non business user to pay for this service. Ask yourself, too, for what do you use your always connectedness?
        </p>
        <p>
         What about music/video/movie streaming services? Again, there are too many free music, radio, DJ apps for it to make sense to spend $120 and up per year to listen to music on a cell phone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some down to earth perspective may help. Consider that the average family of three or four probably pays about $300 a month for cell phones. That is almost $4,000.00 a year. What could you drive for $4000 a year?
        </p>
        <p>
         Sounds simple and obvious, but we are battling with marketers and companies who have made it their lifes work to entice us into needing the newest, hottest, biggest, most megapixel This is an all out war. Are you fighting?

        </p>

         <strong>
          My number one tip for saving money on cell phone service is this:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Think about the buying decision as offense rather than defense. Heres what I mean.
        </p>
        <p>
         No longer are the big 4, contract-wielding carriers consumers only options for cell phone service. There are a growing number of smaller carriers offering more value for less money and doing so on the exact same cellular network as whichever big carrier is leasing spectrum to the given small carrier (i.e. Scratch customers get the exact same cellular experience as Sprint customers when using the cellular network). So instead of treating the cell phone service buying decision as an exercise in defensehow can I manage to give away as little money as possible every month?treat it like offensewhich carrier, big or small, wants my business the most?
        </p>
        <p>
         The proof being in the pudding, this often is as simple as comparing monthly service cost and sign up bonuses, carrier to carrier. For example, *many carriers are running ETF-buyout campaigns whereby theyll give you a check card equal to the early termination fees your old carrier might wish to charge you* should leave mid-contract. Combine that with CellBreaker, who can beat the ETFs altogether, and consumers could:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Switch to a cheaper monthly cellular service.
         <br/>
         2. Beat their existing contract/ETFs.
         <br/>
         3. And put, say, a $1000 check card in their pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thats offense, and thats the marketplace consumers can profit from today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I founded CellBreaker to make it easy for consumers to switch cell phone carriers. People are excited about what were doing, but not just because were beating contractsalso because were doing it in an easy and intuitive way. All told, users spend 5 minutes on our platform, and we can beat their contracts in 7 days.

         <strong>
          Ive found the best way to save money on your cell phone bill each month is to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Do your research  look what other companies are offering that is comparable to the minutes / data you are using each month, see what fits best and then ask your wireless carrier if they can match it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ive had several clients  as well as myself  save anywhere from $30 to $120 a month simply by calling the carrier  explaining that they can get the same service they are getting with another carrier for cheaper, and see what they can do. For the most part, if you have been a loyal customer and are in good standing, they will do what they can do keep your business.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, I had a client who had 5 lines and an 8 GB data plan  a competitor offered him unlimited data for the same number of lines for $100 less a month. He called his carrier and let them know he was ready to switch and they matched the offer. My advice: research all the carriers, call your carrier and see if they will match. It never hurts to ask.

        </p>
        <p>
         Join a friend on shared account and split bill between the two or more of you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also, use Wifi whenever available and use 3g when not on Wifi. Dont sync at all when Wifi is not connected. Also, see if your home Internet company offers hot spot access free  I know Cox and Verizon offer this at lots of locations.
