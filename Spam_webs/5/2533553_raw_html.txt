         In the surprising conclusion of 
          this popular post-noir crime drama, "Hollywood" detective
          and  technical advisor for the TV series
         <i>
          Badge of Honor
         </i>
         Sgt.
          Jack Vincennes  (Kevin Spacey), who was also receiving kickbacks for
          aiding in the arrest of celebrities, was shot in the chest and killed
          by LAPD Capt. Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) for knowing too much. As
          Vincennes slumped to the floor, he said the words 'Rollo Tomasi' to
          his killer as his "valediction,"
          identify Dudley as the mastermind.

         The metaphoric term denoted the corrupt police chief
            as the perfect example of a criminal who was able to escape punishment
            and literally get away with murder. Afterwards when held at gunpoint
            by Smith after a brutal shootout in the Victory Motel, idealistic
            young cop Sgt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) told him about the meaning
            of the term 'Rollo Tomasi' -- (Exley had made up the name after his
            legendary cop-father was shot and killed by a purse-snatcher in the
            line of duty - and he now realized that the chief was a corrupt mastermind
            crime boss ("You're the guy who gets away with it. Jack 
          knew it, so do I")).  When the tables were
          turned, Exley shot Smith in the back as he walked away.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         Afterwards, Exley confessed to superiors
          that the Nite Owl Coffee Shop's multiple murders were conducted by
            LAPD officers (including Smith, who was "assuming control of
            organized crime in the city of Los Angeles" by taking over the
            rackets). Ironically but true to form, Smith was remembered as a
            hero, and a compromised Exley was awarded a Medal of Valor - to avoid
            controversy. Injured but surviving officer Wendell "Bud" White (Russell
            Crowe) departed with Veronica Lake-look-alike prostitute Lynn Bracken
            (Kim Basinger).

         Writer/director/actor M. Night Shyamalan's fantasy thriller about the power of myth and the importance of community contained no traditional trademark "plot twist," although there was a mystery element about the roles of the many characters.

         It told about The Cove apartment manager in Philadelphia:
            stuttering Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), who was hiding a tragic
            past (he was a doctor who had lost his family by murder). In
            the pool of his 5-story complex, he found pale-faced, red-haired
            Story, a "lady in the water" (a narf) (Bryce Dallas Howard)
            who was from the "Blue World."

         As an opening voice-over with crude animated illustrations

            but she also had to return to her world.

         A fairy tale, told by one
          of the tenants, a Korean mother Mrs. Choi (June Kyoto Lu), brought
          Story's scary predicament and life to reality. She described a bedtime
          story about a scared young water-nymph, actually a Madam Narf, who
          wanted to journey back to her home via a giant eagle known as the
          Great Eatlon, although her first task was to be an emissary and impart
          a healing message. She was to locate and then motivate serious but
          unpublished political writer Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan) to complete
          his work (a book titled "The Cookbook") - an influential
          and important historical book that would one day inspire a young boy
          to read it and later become the President of the US. She was fearful
          of growling, grass-furred scrunts, beastly creatures in the grass who
          would consume her.

         The film's message was that there were different archetypal
            roles to be played by the talents of various apartment tenants to
            assist Story in getting home, but they needed to be matched up correctly
            during her departure ceremony. Eventually, they succeeded in identifying
            the proper roles:

         was notable as the first feature-length
          video shot and edited entirely on personal, consumer-level digital
          video equipment (for a reported $900) -
         <i>

         ,
        although it was actually made first. This inventive mock-documentary
        horror film took the approach of re-creating the events by a sleuthing
        documentarian, while
         <i>
          Blair Witch

         favored the approach of watching
        unexplained recovered footage. The film's main taglines were: "What

         In the film's forward, intrigued
        local documentary film-maker and reporter David Leigh (David Beard) explained
          (to the camera) his motivation for studying a recent series of ritualistic
          homicides, allegedly committed by Jim Suerd. The convicted murderer
          (who had died in prison after sentencing - "under mysterious causes")
          was thought to be troubled and emotionally-disturbed. Leigh was  reviewing
          all the footage and  creating a documentary of the group's
          ill-fated trip:

         The first two individuals were the  fictitious hosts
          of a local public-access cable TV show titled
         <i>
          Fact
          or Fiction
         </i>
         -
        an investigatory show about unsolved murders, mysteries, and the
        paranormal. Leigh admitted that he was deconstructing the mystery behind
          the multiple murders in his mock-documentary, with
         <i>
          cinema verite-
         </i>
         styled
          shots - composed of shaky closeups, quick-cutting, and ambiguous scenes:
        </font>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          "I've been forced to change my perspective.
          The question now for me is What? What really happened that night, and
          is Jim Suerd truly responsible?"
         </font>
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         In mid-December
        1995, Suerd made a confused and shocked pay phone call to 911 about his
          missing team members (he said that he had "a really bad feeling
          about it").
        The mutilated bodies of two of them (Wheeler and Clackin) were found
          in the New Jersey Pine Lands, with blood in the snow and the hat of
          the third individual (Avkast). Leigh
        covered the subsequent investigation and trial of Suerd beginning in
        June of 1996. Suerd was accused, charged and tried
        as a major suspect (there was blood evidence from all three on his shirt).
          Suerd was found guilty (in mid-July 1996) of two counts of first-degree
          murder, and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Then, in early
          January 1997, Suerd died in prison of questionable causes.

       <p>
        <font size="2">
         To discover the truth about what had really happened,
          about a year after the murders, documentarian Leigh was re-assembling
          a video chronology and synopsis of the mysterious trip after gaining
          access to all of the available surviving footage, interviews, and police
          evidence - including 15 hours (22 tapes) of archival footage "badly
          shot" by members of the group - and then interweaving the material
          together. He called his work "The
          Last Broadcast." He
          mentioned that the murders had occurred in the "high-tech age" and
          that the dead individuals were all "children of a digital age."

       <p>
        <font size="2">
         The excursion into the woods by the two hosts was
          broadcast (it was their "last broadcast") in a live show
          simultaneously seen/heard via the Internet's Web, TV cable and amateur
          ham radio. They were doing their show while searching for the legendary
          Jersey Devil in the area of Pine Barrens in southern New Jersey. The
          group of four had set out to discover the mythical Yeti-like creature
          - an urban legend. Jim Suerd's background was surveyed - he had a difficult
          childhood and both of his parents had recently passed away. He was
          a magician, a reclusive and "maladjusted" loner and an Internet-obsessed computer
          nerd.

       <p>
        <font size="2">
         The two
        broadcasters, who had set up an interactive, live IRC chat (with a text-to-speech
          converter and computerized voice) to save their dying show and revive
          its popularity, received a suggestion from an unidentified caller ("D
          something") - to do this live show. Thus, the trip into the woods
          was conceived, from which only Suerd returned a few days later. Two
          corpses were found - but Avkast's
          body was never located. There were conflicting opinions during Suerd's
          "kangaroo court" trial (marked by media frenzy), but the
          prosecution's case was so strong that he was inevitably convicted,
          although there was only circumstantial evidence against him.

         Dedicated magnetic-media data retrieval expert
          Michelle "Shelly" Monarch
          (Michele Pulaski) was commissioned to work with additional footage
          that was delivered to documentarian Leigh's house in a brown box, comprising
          a VHS videotape cassette  (possibly hinted
          at earlier, a new tape that was loaded following the 22nd tape) with
          lots of loose and damaged footage mixed in with packing peanuts. Leigh
          decided that the tape would not be submitted to authorities - the trial
          had already concluded and was "closed,"
        especially after Jim's death. He added, ironically: "My search for the
        truth behind the
         <i>
          Fact or Fiction
         </i>
         murders has in some way become
        part of the story." Later, he also stated that he and many others had
        benefited business-wise from the event:
        </font>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          "I always asked the question
          last - 'Did you think Jim did it?' And with the exception of authorities
          directly accountable to the answer, I have felt that the answer given
          has been, 'it doesn't matter.' The truth is what time has made of this
          event. It has been good for business. Often, murder is. So many involved
          have benefited from this event. The inevitable book deal is being
            replaced with a career in the business of image control. And most
            of the people interviewed are ready to embrace it."

         Over
        a period of a few months in early 1997, Michelle retrieved and reconstructed
          the data frame by frame. Her findings proved
          shocking and contradicted everything in the trial:

        <li>
         <font size="2">
          Wheeler and Clackin were alive longer than originally
            thought, at 2:45 am, when they discovered bloodstains in the snow
            and Avkast's hat - "That proves absolutely that Jim couldn't
            have been killing them at that time"

            their murders, he was broadcasting and monitoring messages on the
            IRC in his tent all night long

         Meanwhile, in late March of 1997, David
        Leigh was filming himself as he conducted a re-enactment of the group's
        trip. On April 1, 1997, Michelle promised: "I will see
        the face of the killer." After 2 1/2 months
        work, the killer's face, although blurred in frame 232, was revealed
        to be David Leigh.

        <font size="2">
         Boldly shifting from a first-person
        to a third-person perspective, Leigh burst in to Michelle's studio, struggled
        with her and slowly smothered her with plastic sheeting. He then faced
          his own video camera and announced that he was going to continue staging
          his re-enactment of the original killings - to prove Suerd was
          innocent of the murders. He bundled up Michelle's body in his back
          of his van, and drove out to the Pine Barrens camp site. 
      He continued videotaping himself at the woodsy site as the film concluded.

          (Bill Pullman) $700,000 of pharmaceutical-cocaine drug money, and fled
          from NYC to Upper State New York to the small town of Beston near Buffalo.
          In the local Ray's Bar after she was ignored by the bartender, she
          muttered: "Who's
          a girl gotta suck around here to get a drink?"  She was approached
          by the local, gullible bar pickup stud Mike Swale (Peter Berg) who
          bragged about his manly size: "I'm hung like a horse. Think about
          it," and the sexpot  
          seduced and propositioned him: "No names. Meet me outside." They
          went to his place to spend the night, after which she began scheming
          with her lawyer Frank Griffith (J. T. Walsh) to divorce her husband
          and abscond with the money. She took a job in a local company, Interstate
          Insurance, as Director of Lead Generation, claiming she was alias Wendy
          Kroy (an acronym for New York) and was fleeing from her abusive husband.
          Hiding out, she took residence at the Beston Motor Court (and soon
          after rented a house), and frequented Ray's Bar occasionally. She made
          love to Mike again (as her "designated f--k"), in an alley

         When he asked, "Where do I fit in?" she coldy
          replied:
        "You're my designated f--k." Bumping and grinding later on
        top of him in the back of her Jeep, she admitted to her frequent sex
        partner:  "I'm a total f--king bitch." He complained that he
        was being kept at arm's length like a "sex object." To keep
        him at bay, she stated: "F--king doesn't have to be anything more
        than f--king." Scheming, she tricked Clay's
        black private detective Harlan (Bill Nunn) (who was hired to find her
        and get the funds back, and had traced her to Beston) into becoming distracted
        by showing his large penis to her while she was driving. When he undid
        his seatbelt and exposed himself, she deliberately sped up and crashed the
          car into a utility pole, killing him by propelling him through the
        windshield.

         She took a taxi to Buffalo to
          the Erie County Municipal Building where she identified Mike's earlier
          unwitting and mistaken marriage to a trans-sexual named Trish (Serena)
          - and then conducted an interview with  Trish. She tricked
          Mike into thinking she had taken a weekend trip to Miami to murder
          Lance Collier, a cheating and abusive husband who deserved
          death, to claim the widow's pay-off. She claimed: "I did it for
          us, Mike," and
          wouldn't listen to his objections: "Spare me your brain with countrified
          morality. The world's better off without Lance Collier" - and
          showed him a case of cash (her own!) as "f--king evidence." When
          he was astonished at her brashness, she threw the love-sick
          Mike out of her house.

         She resisted Mike's later apologies (she told him: "You
          have a way of making a woman feel like a one-way train ticket"),
          claiming that he needed to be her equal ("a relationship of equals")
          in order to show his commitment and interest in her. He replied: "Murder
          is commitment?"
          When Mike finally acquiesed, she cleverly convinced him into duplicating
          her scheme to show his love - to murder Clay (who was trumped up to
          be an unfaithful husband/cheater and wife beater in New York City named
          'Cahill'), claiming the payout by the widow would be over three million
          ("You,
          me, three million bucks, New York City, Mike. It's reasonable").
          And then to convince Mike to "pull up stakes" to leave Beston
          and accept her plan, she faked a letter from Trish to Mike asserting
        that she was returning to Beston to be with him.

        <font size="2">
         The murder plan (an "unpleasant chore") to
          stab Clay in his NYC apartment went awry when Mike turned chicken and
          yelled: "I can't do it, Wendy, I can't do it" - and then
          he saw their wedding picture. He realized that the victim was not 'Cahill'
          but Wendy's husband, and that he had been seduced into committing her
          husband's murder. Wendy entered the apartment to check on the killing,
          where she found both Clay and Mike had teamed up, and Mike knew of
          her deception ("So you were gonna have me kill your husband"). In
          a clever double-cross, Bridget killed her own husband by spraying Mace
          down his throat, after kissing him, and then calmly told her naive
          boyfriend: "Now we have a future." Then to complete the deception,
          she aggravated the 'intruder' Mike to rape her
          by first removing her pants and displaying old fashioned men's underwear,
          reinforcing Mike's fears of being homosexual. She then taunted him
          about Trish: "You should have told me you never slept with a man
          before. Must have been some wild night, you getting married so fast."  She
        angered him over his damaged marriage:

       <blockquote>

         She also self-incriminated Mike by surreptitiously recording
          their conversation and the crime/rape confessional role-play on a 911
          call, including the accusation that she repeatedly screamed out: "You
          killed my husband." Mike was arrested, jailed and obviously out-maneuvered
          and set-up for the crime, and he was destined for the electric chair.

         The one remaining shred of evidence, Clay's 6B NYC apartment
          call-button label reading
        "Cahill," was taken by rape-victim and widow Bridget in the
        final scene - she burned it as she slyly smiled in the back of a chauffeured

         Alain Resnais' enigmatic, allegorical

         In the original screenplay, characters were referred

            attempted to convince sleek, elegant and alluring A/Woman (Delphine
            Seyrig) that they had met a year before and had an affair. A second

         In a dance of
          seduction, the two unnamed 'lovers' recounted a fragmented tale of
          their perceived reality and unrealized (?) love affair. The puzzling
            film  never clearly ascertained whether X's claim of a relationship
            was true or false -- however, it could be argued that the entire
            film was only a dream/memory.

          but she was saved in the nick of time by McPherson as Lydecker was

        was bound and duck-tape gagged (and stabbed in the abdomen), after which

          as his beautiful wife (Brooke Mills) was also gut-stabbed and her panties

          Darby was lured by Clyde (an anonymous caller with

            Darby was beginning to become paralyzed from injections (delivered
            from his gun handle) of tetrodotoxin from the liver of a
            Caribbean puffer fish. ("It paralyzes you but leaves all the
            other neurological functions perfectly intact. In other words, you

            blunt the pain. And you're about to experience more of that than
            you could ever f--king imagine.") Tied up and strapped to a
            table, Darby was dismembered
            in a slow, very suggestive, live and videotaped dissection scene.
            Darby was painfully buzz-sawed into about 25 pieces while positioned

         Clyde was placed in solitary confinement. There
          was a reveal of how Clyde was so skilled with heavy machinery, robotic
          weaponry, and high-tech surveillance systems - according to CIA contact
        Bray (Michael Kelly). [Bray was described as "someone who does some really
          nasty s--t so we can live the American dream."] Bray described Clyde
          as:

       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          "a brain. He's a think-tank type guy. His specialty
            was low-impact kinetic operations...We kill people. He figured out
            how to do it without ever being in the same room. It was his gift,
            and he was the best...Just assume that this guy can hear and see
            everything that you're doing....If he's in jail, it's because he
            wants to be in jail. He's a born tactician. Every move that he makes,
            it means something. That cellmate that he killed - you think
            that was random? No. That's a pawn being moved off the board. If
            I were you, I'd be lookin' for the next piece. Anybody who had anything
            to do with that case, he's gonna be comin' after you."

         Bray suggested an easy solution: "Walk into his
          cell and put a bullet in his head" - the only way to stop him.
          Soon, Clyde had orchestrated another death. Judge Laura
          Burch (Annie Corley) was killed with an exploding cell-phone next to
          her ear. Clyde  stated that even from behind bars, the "larger
          picture" (of what he was doing or who was helping him) still eluded
          authorities. He challenged Nick to release him by 6:00 am, or otherwise,
          he would kill everyone - as he demonstrated.

         The Mayor (Viola Davis) of the city was justly infuriated
          ("Get this situation under control"). Clyde 
          promised Nick that he was going to wreak further havoc and destruction
          in the City of Brotherly Love:

         On their way to a press conference following a mass funeral,
          there
          was a surprise assault  on Rice's convoy of black city limousines by
          a robotic, weaponized bomb disposal unit on a trolley with a mounted
          .50 caliber machine gun. In
          the lead car, District Attorney Jonas Cantrell (Bruce McGill) was killed
          when the limo was struck by a  projected missile bomb. The Mayor replaced
          the deceased DA with newly-sworn in Rice, who
          responded to Detective Dunnigan (Colm Meaney) about his new approach
          to the treatment of Clyde: "F--k
        his civil rights."

         In the 'surprise' ending and revelation, Rice discovered
          through records of Clyde's real estate purchases that he owned an
          auto-garage next to the prison. He had constructed a sophisticated
           tunnel from the building to his solitary confinement prison cell 
          ("He had wanted to be transferred into solitary"). From there,
          with a supply of guns, disguises, explosive plastic, and other video
          surveillance equipment, Clyde had executed the murders himself. Clyde's
          final target, while impersonating a janitor, was the bombing of City
          Hall (with a cellphone-activated suitcase bomb filled with malglinite-napalm)
          where a 6th floor meeting with the Mayor and other city officials was
          about to take place. His plan was discovered by Rice and Dunnigan and
          a bomb squad expert.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         In the last scene, Rice confronted Clyde in his cell
          and refused to make a deal with the clever vigilante ("You played us
          real good...I don't make deals with murderers anymore, Clyde. You taught
          me that").
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         In the last line, Rice spoke
        to Clyde, who was prepared to trigger the suitcase bomb with the cellphone
        in his hand:
        </font>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          Rice: "If you go through with this, Clyde, it's
          a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life."
          <br/>
          Clyde: "I'm sorry, Nick."
          <br/>
          Rice: "Me too."
         </font>
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         As Clyde pressed the send button on the phone to the
          bomb-attached cellphone, Rice quickly exited the cell and locked the
          door behind him. He repeated:
        </font>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          "Like I said
          Clyde, it's a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your
            life, which I figure by now is about 25 more seconds."
         </font>
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         Rice had removed the suitcase bomb from City Hall and
          placed it under Clyde's cot, while Dunnigan had blocked the tunnel
          for escape. Clyde
          realized that he had triggered his own bomb to kill himself. He calmly
          accepted his fate as he sat on the cot and looked longingly at his
          daughter's bracelet.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         Thereafter, Nick was peacefully and safely restored to
          his family life. He was seated in an audience, beaming and proud next
          to his wife as they watched their daughter playing onstage during a
          cello concert.

         This plot-twisting, complex techno-thriller (with the
          tagline "A Deadly Seduction"),
            told about microelectronics businessman Dan Morrison (David Hasselhoff)
            who lived in Chicago and had a troubled marriage with his wife of
            eight years Allayne (Sherri Alexander).
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         During a lay-over in San
        Francisco on his way to Tokyo, he met flirtatious, conniving
         <em>
          femme
          fatale
         </em>
         Vickie Dennis (Italian model Yvonne Scio) at the airport
        bar who came up to him and boldly propositioned him for sex - quickly
        consummated in an unclaimed baggage room. Soon after, she was revealed
        to be married to a pushy, opinionated jewel (diamond) merchant named
        Roy Dennis (Gregg Henry) that Dan had met earlier on his previous
        flight. The jealous, abusive dealer suspected that Vickie was cheating
        on him, but didn't know that Morrison had just had sex with her.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         At their home where Dan was lured to help Vickie, he
          used Roy's gun to 'kill' Roy, and found himself held at the SF police
          station and (falsely) charged with the murder. He realized that he
        had been set up when he saw:
        </font>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          (1) a framed photograph on the wall of
          the SF police department's championship bowling team, with "Roy" identified
          as homicide lieutenant Det. Jack Guillardo (also Gregg Henry) who
          had just taken "early retirement" to "live on some
          islands"
         </font>
        </p>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          (2) a morgue photo of the dead man that was
          <em>
           not
          </em>
          the "Roy
          Dennis" that he had met. He realized that Jack had impersonated
          the real Roy Dennis and pretended to be married to Vickie, the 'real'
          Roy's wife
         </font>
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         Dan escaped from the police station and returned
        to the scene of the crime where he confronted Vickie, asking: "Why'd
        you set me up?" and she falsely blamed everything on Jack. Her
        plan was to have her husband killed, and then abscond with $18 million
        (wholesale) worth of diamonds ("You did all this just for diamonds?").
         Dan was deliberately set up to take the blame for the death of the
        real "Roy Dennis" - who had actually been killed in his
        own home by Jack, using the gun with Dan's fingerprints.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         And then
        in one of the film's most surprising moments set in a getaway airport
        hotel room, Jack suddenly shot partner Vickie in the stomach - his
        plan was to pin Vickie's death on Dan and have the diamonds all to
        himself; but things went awry when a bloodied, still-alive Vickie
        stumbled out into the hotel corridor where Jack had to pursue and
        kill her, allowing Dan to escape. Dan followed Jack to the SF International
        Airport terminal and into an off-limits airplane maintenance hangar
        for a deadly stand-off.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         The film ended with Allayne, who had flown
        to SF, shooting Jack to death as he was poised to kill her husband
        - and then in another shocking twist, she admitted her involvement
        with Jack:
        </font>
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font size="2">
          We went to high school together. You were right,
          Dan. I was having an affair. I've been seeing Jack since our reunion
          last year...I planned this. This whole thing was
          <em>
           my
          </em>
          idea...Jack
          told me about this married woman that he had been seeing. About her
          husband, about this woman's sexual nature...All we needed was a perfect
          patsy...Lucky me! I was married to one...It isn't hate, Dan. You
          just weren't exciting anymore.
         </font>
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         Unbelievably, she proposed fleeing
        with Dan and the diamonds - "You and I could walk out of here
        and have a great life together...What's it gonna be, Dan? You and
        me?" -- but he rejected her crazed plan: "I want never
        to see your face again. I want a divorce. F--k you!"
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="2">
         He revealed
        that his cell-phone gadget had recorded their conversation and that
        the police were on their way, foiling her scheme as she was wounded
        in the leg by approaching cops and then handcuffed. Dan was cleared
        of all charges and walked off, knowing the location of the diamonds
        in an airport locker and luckily having the key in his possession.
