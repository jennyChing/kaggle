       Women in regional areas are particularly isolated when it comes to domestic violence. &lt;span class="source"&gt;(Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The prime minister has called for an urgent national approach to tackle domestic and family violence and yet crucial services for victims are being cut. The loss of support services is causing alarm, especially in regional areas where victims are already isolated. &lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt; travelled to Broken Hill and Mildura to investigate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Attorney General has announced that the cuts to Community Legal Services will not proceed, saving the jobs of many front line lawyers working with women experiencing domestic violence. 26th March 2015.

      Kim Hubbard, family violence solicitor&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;The policeare representing most of the victims,butthereis a dedicated family violence lawyerfor the rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;That dedicated solicitor is Kim Hubbard, who handles domestic violence cases across a 130,000 square kilometre region. As of July 1, her position is being defunded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;I know its intimidating when you havent been through this sort of thing before, she says to Rebecca*, who was attacked by her former partner and is about to front court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Hubbard and Rebecca are sitting in a white-walled private consultation room next door to the courtroom where the intervention order applications are heard. Hubbards voice echoes in the tiny space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;When I was about eight weeks before I was due, he hit me on the face to the ground, and he threw plates, bottles, he choked me one night, explains Rebecca.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;This isnt the first time Rebecca has tried to do something to force her ex-husband to stop with the violence. Shes in court today because police have refused to assist her with her application, despite her repeated requests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;I find it fairly shocking that the police never made an application for you, Hubbard says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Unfortunately, its a bit of a thing in Mildura. Ive had clients that have been victims of serious violence and the police are just too lazy to make applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;This sort of behaviour is not on, OK? Im not impressed with police at the moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Rebeccas application is listed for this morning, but theres a complicationher ex has shown up at court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Im just scared of him, she says quietly.Im not just scared,Im shaking now because hes just a psycho. Now hes addicted to ice as well.He probably was when we were together and thats why hes that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Im actually thinking maybeIshould just go home and forget about it,Ireally dont want to go in there when hes in there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Shes shaking visibly and sobbing, and is on the point of backing out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;At the minuteits not like hes harassing me or stalking me or anything its just that anytimeIhave any contact with him hes threatening my life andImsick of it, she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;'Thats whatImean, says Hubbard.That by itself is grounds for an intervention order. Whats more concerning to me is the history of physical violence,because if hes done it before, hell do it again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Yes, agrees Rebecca.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Choking and hitting you when youre pregnant aretwoof the biggest warning signs that we get, continues Hubbard.Thats basicfamily violence101. Thats shocking. We need to be really careful here, alright?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Rebecca nods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;At one point,Hubbardleaves the room to find outwhetherRebeccas ex will agree to theterms of the intervention order,or if he intends to contest it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;You hang in here, and take a few deep breaths, she says as she steps out into the corridor.Ill be back really soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Rebecca shakes and cries softly for the 10 minutes Hubbard is gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Hubbard issmilingwhen she returns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Ive got some good news, OK?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Hes going to agree to the orders,so youre not going to have to worry about hearings or anything like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;You dont have to say anything,Ill just appear for you and tell the judge how its resolved and that hes consenting, and then well just get the final order made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Hubbard is pleased but businesslike. Rebeccaisjustone of the150victimsHubbard has acted for in the past year. Her position will cease to exist on July 1, along with dozens others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;The federal government has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from services that assist domestic violence victims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;According toHubbard,the cuts will have a devastating effect, especially in regional communities like Mildura.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;Youre taking moneyaway from an impoverished areawith high family violence rates and no resources asit is, and leaving us with no other option, she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;The people in the city dont get it;untilyou come to Mildura, untilyouve been through the systemshere, you dont know what its like;what were dealing with;the sorts of matters that come up and the role that we play in terms of beng a lawyer and a counsellor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;It flies in the face of recent governmentaction. Theyve appointedRosieBatty asAustralianof theYear and made all these promises[about]family violence, yet the crucial services are getting cut.I think its setting a very dangerous precedent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s21"&gt;*The victim's name has been changed to protect her identity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
		  &lt;div class="article"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: It's late summer and sweltering in Mildura, Victoria. Lawyer Kim Hubbard is getting ready to go to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: 44.4 at my house yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: How do you cope with that? You just stay at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, it's hard. I hate the heat, so&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: This morning, the local court is dealing with a list of family violence cases. This is Kim's specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: There is 34. It's a fairly good sized list today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: That means 34 victims coming into court today to seek legal protection from their abusers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man&lt;/strong&gt;: How are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm good, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man&lt;/strong&gt;: Good thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm being followed today because we're doing a story on family violence, and because the funding is getting cut for my job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man&lt;/strong&gt;: So how can I help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: So, can I grab a copy of this and of the list please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Kim is just finding out how many women on the list are here alone and need her help. One of them is a young woman we'll call Rebecca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: My name is Kim, all right? Are you all right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Rebecca is here alone, and she's trembling with fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: I know it's a bit intimidating when you haven't been through this sort of thing before. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Rebecca's here to get an intervention order against her ex, who's just shown up unexpectedly at the court. She's terrified of what he might do to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm just scared of him. I'm that scared of him, I'm shaking now because he's just a psycho. He is so unpredictable, and now he's addicted to ice as well. Well, he probably was the whole time we were together and that's why he is the way he is, I don't know. God, I'm actually thinking maybe I should just go home and just forget about it, I really don't want to go in there when he's in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Kim urges Rebecca don't give up. It's all part of a show, she says, Rebecca's ex is just trying to scare her into dropping her case against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: To be perfectly honest with you, I see that a lot. Respondents will come and go on their high horse, and refuse to agree to an order, just to make life as hard for you as possible, okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Around Australia, stories like Rebecca's are shockingly common. Statistics show that one in three women have been subjected to family violence at the hands of a current or former partner. Two women have allegedly been murdered in the last week alone, and 12 since the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's friend&lt;/strong&gt;: The worst part of her story is, this guy killed her. And stayed there watching her that she's giving up, that she's losing her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a friend of a woman we'll call Hannah, who was murdered earlier this year. He was traumatised by the sight of Hannah's dead body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's friend&lt;/strong&gt;: The way he killed her is 10 times worse than anything that you can imagine. It's worse than any animal. Animals, they won't do that to each other, the way he did it to his own wife. The woman that he said 'I love you', he said 'I'll be with you for the rest of my life', you can't imagine one day you get married with someone, then he's actually your killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll hear more about Hannah's tragic death later in the program. We'll also hear from a woman whose life was saved by a community worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in regional areas, such help for victims is scarce, and it's getting worse. The Federal government has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from services that help domestic violence victims, with more cuts still to come. Services are being forced to close, and jobs are being axed. That includes the position held by lawyer Kim Hubbard, who's the only generalist family violence solicitor in the Mallee region. It's a vast area covering 130 thousand square kilometres in north west Victoria. From July 1st, women in that area like Rebecca will have no access to independent legal representation, unless they can pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is solicitor Kim Hubbard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: We're so isolated, we have no other services, we have no Victoria Legal Aid office here, and to take funding away from us would be nonsensical. It would be taking service away from an impoverished area with high family violence rates and limited services as it is, where people have no other option, literally no other option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest concern is the people in the city don't get it. And until you've lived in it, you don't get it. And people who have no idea what goes on out here are making decisions that are affecting us. And I suppose it flies in the face of the recent government actions, they've appointed Rosie Batty as the Australian of the Year and made all these big stories and promised all these changes to family violence, yet the crucial services are getting cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So how worried are you for people like the woman that we just saw in court and others like her in this area?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, I think they will be extremely vulnerable. I think it's setting a very dangerous precedent. There could be a lot of family violence offenders thrive off the power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: The police take out the majority of the intervention orders. Where they don't, solicitors like Kim Hubbard take over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim says that once she's gone, the court won't be obliged to provide these women with a free lawyer. That's not the case with offenders, they will be provided with a duty lawyer in court, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: And then they're getting access to a lawyer and they are, in a sense, winning, and it just becomes another hurdle for these women to try and overcome, and it's terrifying to think about the fact that they are not going to have these services available to them. But if they just had nothing, they are just alone, they'd feel absolutely alone against a legal system that's set up to protect someone that bashes them, to put it bluntly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: At the Mildura court, Kim has persuaded Rebecca to ignore the intimidation of her ex, and press ahead with the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: So I assume that there's been a fairly long history of violence and that sort of thing with him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay, what's happened there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: So when I was about 8 weeks before I was due we were having a fight and he hit me on the face to the ground, he was throwing plates, bottles. He choked me one night. Heaps of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, all right. Is this the first time you've applied for an intervention order against him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, I've been to the police three or four times before this and nothing ever gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay, they've never done it for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. Given the history that you've told me, I find that fairly shocking that the police haven't made an application for you. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a thing in Mildura. I've had a few clients that have been victims of serious violence and the police are just too lazy to make applications. All right, so you've done the right thing by coming here, and we'll hopefully still try and get the outcome for you. All right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Most victims of domestic violence are represented by police. But sometimes  like in Rebecca's case  police refuse to take out an AVO for them. That's why Rebecca showed up in court alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to not get too overwhelmed by it, I know it's really intimidating, all right? But this sort of behaviour is not on, okay? And I'm not impressed with police at the moment, that they haven't made this application for you, okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: So we're going to do everything we can to try and get this sorted today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. I mean at the minute, it's not like he's harassing me or stalking me or anything it's just that anytime I have any contact with him he's threatening my life and I'm sick of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, that's what I mean. That by itself is grounds for an intervention order, let alonewhat's more concerning to me is the history of physical violence, cause if he's done it before, he'll do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Choking and hitting you when you're pregnant are two of the biggest warning signs that we get. That's basic family violence 101. That's shocking. We really, really, really need to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Rebecca and her ex have been separated for two years. Recently he threatened to kill her after she challenged him in the street, demanding he pays child support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: It was my fault the last time, because I pulled over when I saw him and I was so angry, because I'm so fuckin broke because he won't pay child support. And I said, 'Where's my child support?' And it was my fault for pulling over, and he came over to the car and started abusing me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: It's never your fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: But even the police have told me, 'You shouldn't have pulled over, you stupid girl.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes okay, that's fine, but that doesn't excuse his behaviour and then abusing you, okay? That's ridiculous to say that! You pulled over to ask him about your child support and then it's your fault that he abuses you?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: I shouldn't have pulled over though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, but it's still not your fault that he abused you. Okay? It's never your fault. Never ever, ever think that in this situation, okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: You hang in here, and take a few deep breaths and see how you're going, and I'll go and see what I can sort out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Kim goes to speak to the duty lawyer representing Rebecca's ex, to find out if he will agree to the intervention order, or if he wants to contest it. If he agrees, he will be banned from talking to her, phoning her, or going near her. If he breaches this, he can be charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca isn't hopeful, because she doesn't trust the police or the courts. After her ex threatened to kill her in the street, the police charged Rebecca for speeding away in her car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: I get in trouble for putting my foot down too hard on the bloody accelerator but I can have my life and my whole family's life threatened and you don't do anything, constantly. Because they charged me for doing a burnout when I took off too quickly from him being in my car threatening me with his fist, and I put my foot down too quick and took off, and he rang the police and had me charged, and that's the only reason they took my statement at all. Every other time they've just said, 'Oh, we could give him a ring and ask him to stop, but it'll probably just makes things worse.' The very last time I went in there all the policeman said to me was, 'Well, I'd probably be pretty pissed off too if I wasn't allowed to see my kids.' And I just went home, and I said I'm not going to go back ever again, and I haven't worried about it since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Do they know him, on a social level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, good mates, him and the local coppers. He was even the one who helped him measure up when I had spun the tyres to get away from him. He was holding one end of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: The police officer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. And even when we were together and he'd push me around or whatever, I never even thought of ringing the police because he was constantly telling me, you know, no one can touch me in this town because me and the coppers are...you know. So I just feel like, what can I do? I've got no hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: But in this one instance, there is reason for hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: We've got some good news, okay? He's going to agree to the order, all right? So you don't have to worry about hearings or anything like that. So you don't have to give evidence or anything, I'll just appear for you and tell the judge that it's resolved and that he is consenting, and then we'll get the final order made, okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: Feel a bit better now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: I can see some relief!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're about to call it? All right, so we're ready to go in, so if you just want to come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Background Briefing&lt;/em&gt; went to Mildura Police Station to find out why police have been ignoring Rebecca's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: Look, I obviously can't comment on individual situations. However, police officers that work in small remote towns have a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: That's Sergeant Louise Richards, the family violence advisor for the area that covers north western Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: One day they're best mates with someone, the next day they have to be professional and may have to interview them in a legal fashion. So it's something that they deal with on a day-to-day basis, and I think they are quite compassionate and impartial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: But would it concern you if that was the case, that police officers didn't take very serious incidents seriously?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: Most definitely. I'd like to think that that doesn't happen. And if anything like that was to happen, that I would like to know about it so that we can rectify that. In that situation, if that's the way that the female felt, then I would strongly urge her to ring a different police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Even with police handling the majority of intervention orders, lawyer Kim Hubbard has acted in 150 cases alone in the past year. She doesn't just help women fleeing their violent partners, she also helps people trying to escape their own children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria&lt;/strong&gt;: There was just no stopping of him, he had become a monster. He just turned from Mr Nice Guy to wanting me dead. I was terrified. Just frightened that I was going to be petrol-bombed or a hose was going to be put through my door and flood my house out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Maria met Kim Hubbard in court, where she was seeking protection from her drug-addicted son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria&lt;/strong&gt;: I met Kim for this reason, to try to help me when I went to court because I didn't know what to do. I wouldn't know who to turn to, or where to go. How do I survive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;: So what actually happened when Maria came to court was that her son was present with his brother, who we also ended up taking an intervention order out against. And they were both extremely aggravated and storming around the court and yelling, and extra police had to be called. And this was obviously quite traumatising for Maria, so we arranged to have her put in a secure witness room which nobody else could get access to, and arranged for her to be able to speak to the judge over a video link rather than having to appear in the courtroom with her sons. The court staff were a bit shaken I think by their manner and what they were doing. But it was actually an excellent outcome. By the time we got the matter finalised, Maria was actually one of the very few clients that I've had in Mildura who we were able to convince the court to give intervention orders that will never expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Intervention orders usually expire within a year or two. Maria's lifelong order shows just how badly she needed protection. It was granted to her after she told the court about how her son had been vandalising the house, torturing her and threatening to kill her. It was non-stop, and Maria says she nearly took her own life in despair. Just before giving up hope, Maria decided to go to court, but she was scared of having to testify against her own son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria&lt;/strong&gt;: More than scared, I was terrified. I couldn't stop shaking, and I was almost passing out to it at one stage, with fear. Then Kim came into the room and settled me down a bit and then I was able to give evidence through video. I didn't have to face him and I haven't faced him since that day. Kim saved my life. Saved it. And I'm sure she has for a lot of other people as well. But especially for me. She's my guardian angel. Because without Kim being there to talk for me, I couldn't talk to the judge. I wouldn't know what to say to her. That my son's been bad? I don't know how to talk to those sort of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: You're feeling safe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, I'm feeling safe but also I'm feeling all right. Safe and all right are two different things. To feel all right that means you're really floating, do you know what I mean? To feel safe, that's one thing, but to feel all right, everything is good around you. That's how I feel, I feel everything is good around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Maria is stunned at the Federal government's decision to remove funding for Kim's position, and so are police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Louise Richards says women in danger will be made even more vulnerable by the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: There are a lot of victims out there that don't want to go to police, that are in fear of going to police and so would prefer to go to someone like Kim Hubbard to apply for an intervention order for them. So from the community's perspective, that position is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So what would happen to those women who, for one reason or another, can't go to police, and there was no position like Kim Hubbard's anymore? They'd have to represent themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: I don't think that they would even make the report to get the intervention order to start with. I mean, you've got to think we're dealing with women who are probably suffering in self-confidence, feel they have no self-worth, and are just afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Would you consider that a dangerous situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: Most definitely. We can't expect women to report everything to police, as much as we'd like it to, and it's like anything, people need options. I think that it would be a terrible shame if Kim Hubbard's position was to stop receiving funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So these funding cuts make no sense to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louise Richards&lt;/strong&gt;: No cuts within family violence make any sense. But obviously I can't comment on the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Sergeant Louise Richards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;Background Briefing&lt;/em&gt; on RN, I'm Hagar Cohen, and today the shocking reality of domestic violence, and how cuts to frontline support services are failing the victims, particularly those in rural and regional areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road north west of Mildura is long, flat and lonely. It's a three-hour drive to Broken Hill. Here also, domestic violence is at epidemic proportions. Broken Hill's Domestic Violence Liaison Officer is Senior Constable Steve Dohnt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Dohnt&lt;/strong&gt;: Our figures still seem to stay high, it doesn't matter what we do and it doesn't matter what sort of services we offer and things that are out there, the figuresI just don't know how we can actually reduce it, other than keeping on trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Domestic violence is at the core of their work, says crime manager, Detective Inspector Mick Stoltenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mick Stoltenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: It plays a significant role. A lot of the things that we deal witha perfect example, if we're looking at a spate of break and enters that are going on, generally what we find is that the people who we end up identifying, arresting and convicting before the court for doing those break and enters are people who come from DV homes who've had a pretty ordinary upbringing, they may already be in a DV relationship themselves, and it's very frustrating. But it does play a significant role in the things that I have to consider on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Rates of domestic assaults in the far west of NSW are twice the state's average. Detective Inspector Stoltenberg has dealt with some horrific cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mick Stoltenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: He flogged her for an hour and killed her, and her entire chest and every organ was like Jell-O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Just last month he attended the sentencing of a local man who murdered his partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mick Stoltenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: It was actually somethingthey were a couple who originated from Victoria, were living in Dareton, which is in the southern sector of our command. The male and female went home in the early hours of the morning and she was subjected to one of the most savage beatings, which killed her. Significant damages to her face, chest, all her organs. He was just sentenced to 21 years imprisonment for that straight-out cold-blooded extremely violent DV related murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: The circumstances of this murder are shocking, but in this town, men assaulting women is commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Broken Hill resident, Georgia, has almost been killed twice by her ex-husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;: He walked over to me while I was feeding the baby, grabbed me by the throat. Stood me up out of my chair and basically cut my wind pipe off, to the point where I couldn't breathe. My eyes started the glass over, and that's when he let me go. But two days before that we were having another argument and he came up from behind, grabbed me by the hair and dragged me down to the ground, and held scissors to my throat in front of our three kids. He was pushing them into my throat, telling me he was going to kill me. And then he left. But he rang me an hour later, begging to come back and see me, and; sorry, I'll help you with the kids while you lay down, 'cause you must be sore from what just happened. And silly me, I let him back in. Of course I didn't think it was right, but I loved him. I loved him. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Georgia lived with her tormentor for eight years. They have three children together. Leaving him was the hardest thing she's ever done. In the end, her survival instinct kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;: He would say how sorry he was and that he'd never do it again, and I said to him, no, I can't believe that, because there is every chance you could do that again. You snap so easy and fast, what if the kids were getting taken away in a cop car because I was being taken away in an ambulance dead because you pushed those scissors that little bit further into my neck, right underneath here, in the main vein. If you pushed them that little bit harder, I would have been gone, on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Georgia's story is further complicated by the fact that her ex was hooked on ice, and at the end of their relationship she became addicted too. The day she was ready to get out, her mum took her to see lawyer Mariette Curcuruto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;: And she saw us straight away on that day, and gave us direction instantly. I just blurted everything out to her. At this stage I'd hit complete rock bottom. The lawyer put me onto the direction of the AVO, and putting my ex up on charges for the last two incidents of the scissors and choking me, and they were the hardest and scariest things I've ever had to do was actually put him on an AVO, and take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Why was that so hard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;: Because I never thought I'd do it. I never, ever thought I would actually stand up to him like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: What would you have done if you didn't have the legal support?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;: I wouldn't have done nothing, I didn't know, because I kept saying to my mum, 'I can't go to a lawyer Mum, because of all the bad things I've done, the drugs, the everything Mum, I can't go to a lawyer!' I wouldn't have had anything, I wouldn't have had the courage to do this. I would not have done this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: You'd go back home to the violence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, I would have. I didn't even know that I could get away from him. I just thought I was stuck there for life basically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariette Curcuruto&lt;/strong&gt;: Georgia came in with her mum. And I know that she was very nervous about coming in to see me to start with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Mariette Curcuruto is the principal solicitor at the community-run Far West Legal Centre. Her services are free and immediate because she deals with women in extremely dangerous situations, women like Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariette Curcuruto&lt;/strong&gt;: And what she really needed was some really good, clear advice about; this is what you need to do, this is who you need to see and these are the markers you need to hit to be able to get to a point where a court feels comfortable to accept your story from the point of view of seeking an AVO, and feels comfortable with you from a parenting perspective as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: And why was it so important that you give her this legal advice and you start working on her case immediately?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariette Curcuruto&lt;/strong&gt;: She was in a situation that was very volatile. By 'volatile' I'm really talking about physical danger. She was in imminent physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Things are about to change in Broken Hill. The Federal government's cuts to legal services will cancel most of the funding for Mariette's practice by July 1st. That means she won't be able to take on cases like Georgia's, and that reduces this solicitor to tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariette Curcuruto&lt;/strong&gt;: I don't even want to think about that, I really don't. I am dreadful at saying no. And it absolutely guts me to have to say to people, 'I can't help you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you okay, Mariette?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariette Curcuruto&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, I'm okay, sorry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: It's a very emotional topic, I can see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariette Curcuruto&lt;/strong&gt;: It is for me. I fear for our community. Our legal staff are second to none, and our paralegal staff and information staff and our CEO are second to none. The idea of having to try to run a service without any of those people, just trying to run it with both hands tied behind my back, blindfolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: In four months, all of the staff in Mariette's office will lose their jobs. Mariette is likely to become part-time. The Centre's manager, Tracey Willow, whose job may also go, says it's possible that Broken Hill will lose all of its community lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: So in this community we're facing the prospect of losing between four and five solicitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Out of how many?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: Out of five. That's a lot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So you are losing four to five, out of five?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: That's right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you made it clear to the Department about these concerns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: We've been fighting on and off for the last three years. But more recently, I feel like we've become a tennis ball between the state and federal government. Ultimately the state is saying it's the federal's responsibility, and the federal government says it's the state's responsibility. So we're a tennis ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: It's not just the legal services that are under threat. The only women's refuge in town has also had its funding cut. Following a complete overhaul of the domestic violence sector by the New South Wales government, the refuge was forced to reduce staff by 60%, and shorten its operating hours from 24/7 to business hours only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: Domestic violence is not something that happens nine to five. So we have women who experience violence and abuse after hours and on weekends. There is no guarantee that those women can get into that one (and I do say &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;) refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: There are also concerns about how the refuge is being run after the recent restructure. Rhonda Fekeila resigned from her position as a case worker at the refuge late last year, when the cuts kicked in. Prior to the restructure, she remembers letting women in throughout all hours of the night, sitting with them, talking, listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhonda Fekeila&lt;/strong&gt;: Some came with injuries, and very emotionally broken. Scared. Afraid that the partner would come for them. But they felt a lot more at ease when they knew that someone was there to monitor the place and just keep them safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: When the refuge's operating hours were reduced, which meant women would be left alone at nights and weekends, Rhonda Fekeila had serious concerns about the safety of the women, and the staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhonda Fekeila&lt;/strong&gt;: We had concerns about if we were still working there, you know, walking in on something. It was a scary thought of having to do that. I think in a way that sort of pushed for us to not want to be there anymore. There was nothing there stopping the partners, or the person that the girls were getting away from, from getting into the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So you were scared that the perpetrators would come in and there would be no one watching?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhonda Fekeila&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, that was my thoughts on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: And that would be particularly worrying on a Monday morning after a whole weekend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhonda Fekeila&lt;/strong&gt;: Especially if you walk in and find someone dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Another former staff member at the refuge, Fiona Camilleri, told &lt;em&gt;Background Briefing&lt;/em&gt; that a number of women she knows who have a history of domestic violence won't go to the refuge because they feel it's unsafe. She now works for a different service that supports women on a long-term basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiona Camilleri&lt;/strong&gt;: We see a lot of clients here that just refuse to go to the refuge only because the security is not there. They feel that because their staff are not there at night and weekends, they don't feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So women came here and told you that they would not go to the refuge because they are not feeling safe there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiona Camilleri&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: How many women?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiona Camilleri&lt;/strong&gt;: I think I've had about four women so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Fiona Camilleri says she anticipated the problems when the changes were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiona Camilleri&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn't believe in my job anymore. Does it all just come down to money? And that was a rude shock for me. Yeah, it comes down to money. Too bad about people's lives, about children's lives, that these women are suffering, escaping from a domestic violent relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you reckon you could show me around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, we can go for a bit of a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: The women's refuge in Broken Hill is run by a Salvos' husband and wife team, Lieutenant Phillip and Donna Sutcliffe. The grounds are spacious, and seem well-resourced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: The facilities that we've got at the moment, we have six one-bedroom bedsit units at this facility, and we've also got three-bedroom demountable townhouses, so they're more suited for families with kids and things like that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: There's a children's play area too, but it's deserted. In fact the whole place looked empty, which is pretty odd, considering that Broken Hill has one of the highest rates of domestic violence in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Here it's a great facility and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you full at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: No, at the moment it's quite quiet. We are quite empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Completely empty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: No, we've got two clients in at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So is it unusual to have just two clients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Not really. Under the new funding arrangements that we do, there is obviously some stricter government regulations, and there's also a change in how we deliver our service as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Phillip Sutcliffe is referring to the state government's controversial Going Home Staying Home reforms, which have stripped funding from many refuges across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillip is new to the domestic violence sector. He and his wife arrived in Broken Hill two months ago, replacing the outgoing managers. In an effort to absorb the funding cuts, the Salvos have imposed stricter guidelines for women who access the centre: pay for your stay, or you won't be allowed back. Phillip says that in the past, residents of the refuge didn't always pay, but he's put a stop to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of that, people are finding that it's not simply a service that they can come and use and abuse. There's actually responsibilities about them coming here now. We follow up on making sure they are making their payments for their accommodation, that they've come to stay here. It's not just a free service that they can just come in and go as they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Use and abuse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: We've got clients on our list that have racked up hundreds of dollars of debt from our service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So they can't come back unless they pay off their debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. So we run this program, because as part of our case management we want to help them get into sustainable accommodation, and if simple things like that...we don't charge much per night here, yet if you go to the private rental market you're paying probably 200 times what we're charging a night. So if they're not paying their nightly allowance here, we as an organisation can't really write them a reference to say that they're on-time payers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Phillip Sutcliffe says that in extreme situations, his staff may be more lenient, but he can't provide any guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: It's not just a use and abuse type service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you actually had to turn women away because of debt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Not recently, but yeah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: It happened in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, it has happened in the past...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: It must be gut wrenching for you to have to turn women away when they need you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: I've not had to deal with that myself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: The caseworkers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So if they are in real dangerous situations..?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, every circumstance is different, and it's completely up to the discretion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: So you won't worry about the debts in those circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Sutcliffe&lt;/strong&gt;: You know, at the end of the day we want to make sure that where possible those debts are getting cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow, no, I was not aware of that! And now that's going to make even more women who are already extraordinarily vulnerable, even more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: The manager of the Far West Legal Community Centre, Tracey Willow, is shocked by this new rule at the refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Willow&lt;/strong&gt;: My question back to you, and more importantly to them, which I will ask them, is where will those women go? And by enforcing those rules, what are we saying to women about making the choice to leave a violent relationship? That's really scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be incredibly dangerous. I'm reading current statistics on the number of women who have already died in Australia. I always hope that we're not going to see any women in this community. But if we're going to enforce rules like that, or if we are not going to fund services adequately, we're going to see women die in our own community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Across Australia, women are already dying because they can't find safe refuge. We'll hear about one death shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our investigation has found that most of the women's refuges in NSW now operate during business hours only. These days, if you ring after hours, you're likely to hear an automated answering machine, like this one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering machine message&lt;/strong&gt;: Hi, we can't get to the phone at the moment, but please leave a message and we will return your call as soon as we can. If you are in crisis, please ring 000 and give your location. If you are after accommodation, ring 1800 656 463. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: When the cuts to the funding of refuges were announced mid last year, many of their employees panicked. Roxanne McMurray coordinated a women's campaign to stop the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roxanne McMurray&lt;/strong&gt;: You can only describe it as chaos, and there was a real sense of loss and grief and confusion. They told us that it was breaking their hearts that they had to turn people away, and they knew that women were getting the run-around at the time, but there was very little that they could do. We were all holding our breaths, hoping that things would settle down really quickly and that there wouldn't be a homicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: But stories about women being turned away from refuges and going back to their violent homes kept coming in. Until what everyone dreaded actually happened. A homicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young Sydney woman, who we can't name for legal reasons, was looking for a refuge in the months leading up to the end of last year. It was during the chaotic period when many refuges were shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman, who we'll call Hannah, had been abused by her partner for years. And now she decided to leave him, he was threatening to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah's sister told &lt;em&gt;Background Briefing&lt;/em&gt; that Hannah rang on more than 10 times asking for a room in a refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's sister&lt;/strong&gt;: These people told, 'I don't have any room, empty room.' Many, many women's place for women she is calling, always. All full. She is always calling, but no empty room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Hannah was desperate. A family friend says just before Hannah escaped, her husband developed a sinister, and very dangerous habit. He was simulating her murder by strangling her, letting her go just seconds before she lost consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's friend&lt;/strong&gt;: This guy make her to lie on her back, and bring both her arms on her sideway, and then grab both arms and put it under her body. And then sitting on her arms, hands and her knees, so that she cannot move, and then grab her from her neck, strangling her. And then when she gets sort of losing the energy to fight back, then he put a blanket over her face, and jumping over her body. She come to the stage that fear that she's going to be dead any minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Although Hannah wasn't living at home anymore, her ex knew where to find her. She knew she wasn't safe. One day this year, her husband killed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh they sent you the video of the burial, the funeral?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's sister&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Video audio&lt;/strong&gt;: Sounds of distress, wailing]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's sister&lt;/strong&gt;: She is my sister. She is my aunt. She is another sister. She is my little sister. She is my cousin. My mum collapsed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, she is collapsed, your mum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's sister&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: Hannah is one of 13 women who have been killed from family violence since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's sister&lt;/strong&gt;: She now dead. She's gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's friend&lt;/strong&gt;: She's dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah's sister&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, dead now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hagar Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Background Briefing&lt;/em&gt;'s coordinating producer is Linda McGinness, research by Anna Whitfeld and Jess Hill, technical production by Leila Shunnar, our executive producer is Chris Bullock.

	&lt;p class="comment"&gt;The LNP cuts the social wage.  The LNP cuts funding for public health, education and welfare.  At the same time, the LNP talks about &quot;closing the gap&quot; and talks about ending domestic violence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While more wealth is being produced every year, as proven by the 2-3% real rise in the GDP, less revenue is coming into the government treasury thus necessitating cuts to social spending.  The upper 10% who own the companies and most of the shares, real estate, bonds and other forms of wealth, are having their taxes cut.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn't the solution obvious?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="comment"&gt;Yes Mike you're 100% right, but how do we get a government to stop siding with the upper 10% and stand up to them? And Labor are almost  just as bad; what have they done about it? Little or nothing. Perhaps if we could have a majority of independents who believe in equality and fairness, we might be able to redistribute wealth back to the people who deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="comment"&gt;Good points. The Libs go WAY away from the ordinary standards of most Australian people by cutting services to stop domestic violence and legal aid too to just mention two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they act like normal politicians and talk with concerned faces about cutting the gap etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does someone like Tony Abbott walk down the street and look at an ordinary Australian and smile, while thinking &quot;I'm stealing the decency out of your society mate, for my own political gain&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="comment"&gt;women will continue to be tortured, murdered and abused by violent men while we have monogamy - one man and one woman (usually) living in one house, shielded from neighbours.  secrecy is essential to violence of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with shared housing, women-only and men-only affordable accommodation, the violence by men against women would lessen considerably.  with continued secrecy and couples each living in a little box, the slaughter will continue.  no government report, enquiry or commission will change anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lack of funding and support from government contributes to the problem, as do violent men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;behind it all is the man's fear of women.  so, he makes sure the women are vulnerable, unsupported, isolated and (especialy), powerless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a small minority of fine men who are not afraid of women and have no desire to punish them.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="comment"&gt;The smallest amount of money makes such a difference.  When one thinks of what will be spent on the inquiry into Domestic Violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-incidentally, yesterday I visited Travellers Aid at Southern Cross Station in Melbourne.  This efficiently run little office helps many people every day.  Their funding was recently cut so that a social worker is no longer employed and material aid unavailable.  This office used to help women and their children fleeing domestic violence who had arrived at the station with nothing.  No longer.  Let's all have another inquiry to find out what we should have spent that money on!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class="comment"&gt;It seems that the problem is more openly talked about now, as I remember when growing up it was never discussed or reported, an unfortunate hangover though is that we still seem to be (perversely) blaming the victims' (directly and indirectly)? This culture is steadfastly supported by our misogynist government when they promise to deliver on domestic violence but systematically undermine all the services and support, and treat women in this county with contempt in the process. They should be ashamed, but instead view this as a 'saving' - disgusting state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
