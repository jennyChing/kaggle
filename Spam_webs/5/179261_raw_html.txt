  </p>
  <p>
   Adult male and female rats leave drops of pee everywhere toadvertise their sexual availability. Pee contains a lot ofinformation about the rat who made it! It's like a personalresum. It tells another rat one's species, sex, age, socialstatus, reproductive status, and individual.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here's what a urine mark tells another rat:

   Adult males, especially socially dominant ones, mark the most.Males mark even more when they smell a female nearby! Male marking isinfluenced by testosterone: neutered rats mark less than intactrats.
  </p>
  <p>
   Females mark less than males. Females do most of their marking thenight before they go into heat (every 4 days). Females also mark morewhen they can smell other rats nearby, and females prefer the urinemarks of high-testosterone males.

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    This smells like me!
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   But attracting rats of the opposite sex isn't the only reason ratsmark. Rats use their
   <i>
    own
   </i>
   urine marks too.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats mark because they like things to smell like them. Having lotsof personal smell around may comfort them. It may help them becomefamiliar with an area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats mark in response to novelty, too. Put a new object in a rat'scage and chances are, the rat will mark it. They also mark more whenthey smell something new to them, like a strange rat, or a cat, ormint.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats may also mark because it helps them know where they are andwhere they've been. Rats will re-mark an object that has been movedto a new spot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats are also capable of following the odor trails they have leftthrough the environment.

    Isn't urine marking territorial?
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   It is common to think that when a mammal scent marks, it's markingits territory. This means that the urine plays a role in territorialdefense: the urine is supposed to deter others of the same speciesfrom entering that space.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, most claims of territorial marking have little or noempirical support in most species. In rats, the evidence is mixed:some studies find that male urine deters other males, other studieshave found that male urine
   <i>
    attracts
   </i>
   other males. Therefore, itis as yet unclear whether urine marking in rats has a territorialfunction or not.

    Why do rats pee onfood?
   </b>
  </font>
  <p>
   Rats pee on food too. But before you grimace, remember thechallenge rats face when deciding what to eat. Rats live all over theglobe, and they are capable of eating a large variety of foods, fromvegetables to grains to meat to twinkies. This ability to eat allsorts of stuff is different from, say, the panda bear which eats onlybamboo, or the koala which eats only eucalyptus.
  </p>
  <p>
   How on earth is a rat supposed to know what to eat? Mistakes canbe fatal! Eat a toxic leaf or poison bait, and the rat is toast. Ratsalso have to be really, really careful about what they put downthere, because they
   <a href="vomit.htm">
    can't vomit
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats use a wide varity of strategies to choose what to eat. Forone, they tend to take just a tiny taste of a new food, and if itmakes them sick they strictly avoid that food afterwards. Anotherstrategy they use is to
   <i>
    learn from other rats
   </i>
   . If another ratate something, it's probably safe. So baby rats prefer to eat foodsthey taste in their mother's milk. Young rats prefer to eat foodsthey smell on each other's breath.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats also prefer to eat at food sites where other rats have eaten.These food sites are marked with a chemical attractant in the urine.Rats who eat food that turns out to be safe mark the area with achemical attractant. Young rats prefer to eat at those sites. Thisattraction to urine at food sites is particularly strong in youngrats. It wanes as they grow older.

    Female marks a male: I like you!
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Female rats tend to mark the males they like with more urine thanmales they don't like. Females typically like the most aggressivemales who have high levels of testosterone. Such males may makebetter mates, because they're more fecund and successful thannonaggressive, low-testosterone males.
  </p>
  <p>
   As with environmental marking, the female marks males most whenshe
   <i>
    isn't
   </i>
   in heat. It is possible that she may be picking outand notifying the males she likes best in advance, so when she comesinto heat a few days later, her own urine marks will help her pickwhich males to mate with. This hypothesis has not yet been tested,however.

    Males mark females, too
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Males mark all females at high rates, regardless of whether thefemales are in heat or not. The function of such urine marking isunknown, but there are many possibilities. As with environmentalurine marking, it could be a sexual advertisement ("I'm available!Mate with me!").
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Juveniles mark adults, and vice versa!
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Juveniles don't start marking their environment until they enterpuberty, but they start marking
   <i>
    other rats
   </i>
   much earlier! Onemonth old males copiously mark adult males, who copiously mark themright back. Juvenile and adult females urine mark each other too, atlow rates that don't change with age.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the young male rats approach puberty, they mark adult malesless and less. This decline might happen because tension socialtension is growing between the adolescent and the adult male. Astension grows, the young rat is less likely to climb over the adult,so he has less opportunity to mark him.
  </p>
  <p>
   The function of juvenile-adult marking has never beenexplored.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, we
   <i>
    do
   </i>
   know that juvenile urine inhibits attack byadult males: adult rats dabbed with juvenile urine are attacked lessthan those dabbed with adult urine. So, a juvenile's urine on his ownfur stops attack. It is possible that a juvenile that smears urine onan adult male may inhibit the male's attack, too. This is purelyspeculative, but it's an interesting possibility.

    The dominant rat marks subordinates
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   The socially dominant male marks subordinates about three timesmore than they mark him. This difference might be because alpha ratscrawl over subordinates a lot more than the reverse. Therefore,subordinates don't have as much opportunity to crawl over thedominants and mark them.
  </p>
  <p>
   
   <i>
    Subordinate rats mark the dominant rat
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    othersubordinates
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Subordinare rats urine mark too. They deposit equal amounts ofurine on everybody: other subordinates and the dominant rat.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, subordinates can't crawl over the dominant rat as freelyas they crawl over their fellow subordinates. They make up for thisby depositing
   <i>
    twice as much
   </i>
   urine on the dominant rat whenthey manage to crawl over him as they do when they crawl over asubordinate.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, the subordinate rat marks other subordinates and the dominantrat with equal amounts of urine, but they deposit their urine on thedominant rat in half as many passes.

    Conclusion
   </b>
  </font>
  <p>
   Urine marking has many meanings, depending on the rat who made theurine mark and on the rat who smells it. Marks are used as
   <b>
    sexualadvertisements
   </b>
   , to attract rats of the opposite sex. A rat usesits own scent marks to
   <b>
    maintain an odor field
   </b>
   and help it
   <b>
    navigate
   </b>
   through the landscape. Adult rats mark
   <b>
    safe foodsites
   </b>
   which young rats prefer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rats mark each other, too. Between males and females, such markingis probably
   <b>
    sexual.
   </b>
   Females tend to mark the males they likebest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Juveniles mark adults too. We don't know why, but it might help
   <b>
    deter adult attack
   </b>
   . Males mark other males: dominant malesmark subordinates more than the reverse, but subordinates mark too.Subordinates mark both dominants and other subordinates. The functionof male-male marking is unknown.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, urine marking doesn't mean the same thing every time.The chemical cues contained in urine vary intimately with the biologyof the rat that produced the urine. So the meaning of a particularurine mark depends on the individual -- its age, sex, social status,and reproductive state. In addition, rats who smell a urine mark mayglean a different message from it depending on who
   <i>
    they
   </i>
   are: afemale in heat, a juvenile, and a subordinate male will all responddifferently to, say, an adult male's urine.
