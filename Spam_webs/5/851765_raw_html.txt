           After the second of his two missed extra points left the New York representative of the Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL) in a 1312 hole with just under three minutes remaining against the Omaha Mammoths, the mood at MCU Park in Coney Island was decidedly unfriendly. On the sidelines, Marsh would occasionally peek at what was happening on the field, but he spent the majority of his time practicingkicking into a net over and over and over.

          <p class="graf--p" id="66c5" name="66c5">
           After each and every kick, the crowd on the Brooklyn side of the fieldthere were some 3,500 extremely vocal fans in attendancemade their feelings about Marsh and his performance known. They were relentless, and they were not kind.

           Back in Marshs hometown of Petaluma, California, soccer used to be his thing. Well, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, and gymnastics for starters. He estimates that he played nine sports competitively as he was growing up, and the only reason football joined that list was because he wanted something to do with his father, Scott, as they waited for his brother to finish up his Pop Warner practice.

          <p class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote" id="5fb4" name="5fb4">
           I asked my dad if I could kick field goals, and I kicked every single day until I finally made one, Marsh says. Eventually, he found his way onto a Pop Warner squad, and the die was cast. I was probably the only kid in the nation that could make a field goal on a consistent basis at the age of 10 years old.

           Thirteen years after those early successes, Marsh found himself on the sidelines in Brooklyn, far away from sunny California. In the FXFLwhich launched in October with four teams and countless dreams of making it to the NFLextra points are attempted from 35 yards out, not 20 yards like in the NFL. The higher degree of difficulty, of course, often results in crowds harassing their kickerstheyre used to extra points being made.

           Every time we score a touchdown, I get a little excited, Marsh laughs. But when its back to being a 35-yard kick, thats a realistic field goal youve got to work hard onyou can miss it pretty easy.

          <p class="graf--p" id="5535" name="5535">
           In this respect, Marsh is just like each of his Bolts teammates. Players do not want to miss anything: a block, an assignment, an extra point. For many, this is their last chance, their final opportunity to make enough of an impression upon someone watching who is in a position to make their NFL dreams come true.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="efb9" name="efb9">
           Marsh, who played Division I college football at the University of Utah and Rutgers University as both a punter and kicker, had a tryout with the New England Patriots earlier this year, but it didnt pan out. For him, the FXFL is an opportunity to stay in football shape, get usable tape to send out to NFL teams, and be in a live situationeven if its only for a few games.

           Two extra point misses will not help his cause, despite his versatility as a specialist who can kick field goals, punt, and lead the kickoff team.

           Brendan Schaubs athletic journey has been quite different than Marshs. Schuab, a professional mixed martial artist who happens to be on the UFC roster, played fullback for the University of Colorado in 200405. He later went to the Buffalo Bills training camp and earned a spot on the practice squad, but he was released after sustaining an injury. While there was some interest from other NFL squads, he ended up with the Utah Blaze of the Arena Football League.

          <p class="graf--p" id="9f4d" name="9f4d">
           For Schaub, mixed martial arts was a way for him to leverage his athleticism and determination in a different sportand succeed at that sports highest levels. Unlike Marsh and his other teammates, who have spent countless hours waiting for that life-altering NFL phone call, Schaub did have other options.

Quarterback Corey Robinson, who starred at Troy University and was briefly with the Cleveland Browns before making his way to Brooklyn, led the Bolts down the field as the clock wound down. A 49-yard pass to A.J. Leonard put the team in field goal range, and with 16 seconds left, Marsh got the call to hit a 36-yard field goal.

           How my agent put it to me is that within the next 45 to 60 days, theyre going to bring people in for tryouts and then theyre going to sign you to future contracts in January if they like you, he explains. That being said, my agent has said that hes talked to 12 different teams. I dont know which ones, I dont know how serious it is, but Im hoping just one of those teams give me a shot. Because of playing with the Bolts, Ive been able to stay in shape and kick a couple times a week and get some game action, so Im hoping that I do get another shot.

           Even if he doesnt get that NFL shot, Marsh isnt one of those people who will go on to the next chapter in life with regrets.

           At the end of the day, Im 23 and Im still playing football, which is my passion. Im going to have fun regardless. Win or lose, Im gonna know that I tried my hardest and that I gave it the best effort that I can and Im having a good time.

           Its supposed to be one kick at a time, and youre not supposed to think about the past, Marsh said. But regardless of anything that happens in my life, I will always remember that kick. No matter how many times I tell you its one kick at a time and youve just got to move on, I loved it.
