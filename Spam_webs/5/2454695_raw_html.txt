        Ralph Loglisci is a national food and health policy writer and media consultant. Hes served as the director of communications for several national organizations, such as the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, The Berman Institute of Bioethics and Wholesome Wave. Additionally, Ralph spent several years as the Project Director for the Johns Hopkins Healthy Monday Project based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Healths Center for a Livable Future (CLF). His primary focus was leading behavior change communications research and serving as an advisor to both CLF and the national Meatless Monday campaign. Ralphs entrance into food and health policy was spurred by his experience of losing 200 lbs. through diet and exercise. Previously he spent nearly 15 years as an Emmy Award-winning broadcast journalist.

         <i>
          SA

         editors have joined industry in trying to persuade public opinion against the benefits of labeling GMOs. Their argument is that labels might scare uninformed American consumers from purchasing GMO foods and thwart future development of GMO technology.
        </p>
        <p>
         Insinuating that Americans cannot be trusted to make informed purchasing decisions on their own is down right insulting and totally out of sync with the majority of Americans who want to know whats in their food.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to make it very clear that I am not against biotechnology research advances; I think they play an important role in the future of medical and agricultural sciences. I am, however, opposed to the position that
         <i>
          SA
         </i>
         believes that labels for GMO foods are a bad idea. Preventing people from knowing whats in their food, in my opinion, is a bad idea.
        </p>
        <p>
         The editors believe American consumers will become confused over mandatory labels and stop buying foods made with GMOs based on misconceptions that, so-called Frankenfoods endanger peoples health. This is not a forward thinking position to take.
        </p>

         If
         <i>
          SA

         editors believe, as poll after poll show, that the 93 percent of Americans who support GMO labeling are making their decision based on irrational fears, then they should work harder to convince them that their fears are truly baseless, rather than supporting efforts to deny people the right to truth, transparency, and trust. We can never expect to have a strong democracy, or an enlightened consumer-base for that matter, if we do not ensure citizens are making well-informed decisions.

         which means
         <i>

         whether their food is genetically engineered, or worse, they believe Americans are too obtuse to understand an issue that we all agree  is in no way simple.

        <p>
         In a democratic society it is incumbent upon the scientific community to share their knowledge in a way that can be understood by everyone. Simply telling the American public, Trust us, we know better than you when it comes to GMO technology, does less to help people understand the issues than ensure corporations can continue to make profits on technology that has yet to live up to its claimed potential.

          keynote address
         </a>
         at the Conference on Crop and Forest Biotechnology for the Future in 2001. She said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If research is to address the challenges in agriculture, we need to put genetic modification in context, and realize that it is but one of the many elements of agricultural change. Scientists must not be blinded by the glamour of cutting-edge molecular science for its own sake.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         When it comes to food safety, most experts agree very little research exists that shows eating foods that contain GMOs negatively impact human health. Like most of the food we eat in the U.S., food safety tests are funded by the same companies that produce the products, making independent studies nearly impossible to conduct. Many scientists Ive talked with agree that GMO foods are most likely safe to eat, but they believe much more independent long-term research must be conducted to make sure.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there are some studies that do raise concerns. For example, industry scientists claimed that the toxins or biopesticides created by genetically modified crops, approved only as animal feed, would never make it out of the digestive tract of the animals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Apparently Bt toxins from GMO corn or possibly other GM crops are not only making it out the animals stomachs they are finding their way into people.

         taken by 30 pregnant women in a Quebec hospital and 80 percent of the samples taken from umbilical cords tested positive. Scientists believe that the toxins made it into their bodies after they ate food products from animals fed genetically modified corn. So far scientists have not found that the Bt toxins have impacted anyones health, but researchers believe many more studies are needed to determine long-term health effects.

        <p>
         When American consumers buy a food product, health impacts, while very important, are not the only factors that lead them to their final purchasing decision. Labels such as Country of Origin, Fair Trade, or USDA Organic, all help consumers make well-informed purchasing decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         There may be legitimate reasons to argue against mandatory GMO labeling, but claims that Americans cannot be trusted to make rational decisions about what they want to feed themselves and their children is not one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bottom line: Americans want to know whats in their food and how its produced, including those who regard themselves as scientific Americans.

             Why would Scientific American be against informing the public, isnt the the whole purpose of the magazine? For pitys sake, how else are they distorting and misinforming the public. Scary, I wont buy that magazine any more.
