       This is infuriating
      </a>
      : According to todays
      <em>
       New York Times
      </em>
      , most low-wage workers in America are victims of routine theft. The thieves: wealthy employers, who steal on average 15% of their low-wage employees pay by routinely underpaying them for their work, according to a
      <a href="http://nelp.3cdn.net/319982941a5496c741_9qm6b92kg.pdf">
       new report
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Huge numbers of Americas low-wage workers dont even earn minimum wage for their work. Only 20% of these wage-slaves dare to complain or consider starting or joining a unionand of those who do, nearly half suffer illegal punishment at the hands of their bosses and/or companies, either suspended or fired. And of course, the companies never worry that the government will do anything to them for illegally stomping on Americas vulnerable, because you know, government is a bad, bad thing.
     </p>
     <p>
      We live in Dickensian times again, folks, except that ours is a degraded Dickens: our Dickensian victims dont evince any of the pathos of Dickens 19th century characters, because officially, none of this is even happening. And if it is happening, its their own damn fault.
      <span id="more-12045">
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      So to repeat: the average low-wage worker is the victim of corporate theft every weekhis wealthy company steals 15% of his wages as a matter of routine. It happens all the timemost workers say their company robbed them as recently as last week!
     </p>
     <p>
      Ive been studying this kind of 21st century Dickensian exploitation in America for several years now, because so many going postal shootings over the past 25 years took place in companies where this kind of exploitation is rampantfrom

      earlier this year, where both the shooter and his mother were part of an infuriating

      Reading this article reminded me again of a common meme among the smug I see through the bullshit / Im neither right nor left cheeseheads that we at The eXile and eXiled Online always had to hear: before the 2008 crisis, the answer to why there arent larger uprisings in America was always, The working class has been bought off. Everyone just wants a plasma TV. Now that its no longer merely leftwing to recognize how foolishly deluded that kind of thinking was, this meme has morphed into an equally idiotic they dont rise up because theres no way to win! Its as though ours is the first generation ever to face bad odds when fighting for our rights.
     </p>

      The problem, as I see it, is that everyones looking for a way to avoid looking at this for what it is. Instead everyones energy is spent looking for a cheap shortcut around what is really a straight-forward horror story, our horror story. And the cleverest of all keep falling into that safe, comfortable trap of cheap cynicism the soporific that Nietzsche warned of.

         So what are we left to do?  Americas low wage/working class worker is a stupid slave that worships his master and his masters interests.  What political position does that leave us with?  The white American working class are stupid losers, and the oligarchy are evil fucks.

         What other option is there?  Im a lawyer, so Ill be ok, so long as the present horrible system holds up. If the stupid peasants cant figure out their own interests, why should I give a shit about them?  Do I really want a proletarian revolution of stupid hillbillies from West Virginia?

         They largely dont; the targets are usually management. When they do, its often because, workers or no, those were some of the people who made their working life a living hell, and if your whole purpose in being there is payback, why *not* blast those fuckers?
        </p>
        <p>
         If poor Americans are stupid losers, thats only because the fucking left in this country up and deserted us. Yall liberal bourgeois  as if there were such a thing, you goddamned hypocrite  types better hope like bloody fucking hell that this country doesnt go all the way to balls-out fascist, because if we do, your worthless, self-satisfied asses are going to be up there hanging naked from the lampposts right next to the oligarchs, and theres going to be an awful goddam lot of working-class *former* liberals  myself included  in the torches-and-pitchforks brigade.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sure, theyll kill us in job lots later, when weve outlived our usefulness to the regime, but theres no difference between that and the way things are now, except the possibility of a much quicker, kinder, and more dignified death. And, hell, I already want to die  if a quick death like that was all I had to accept in exchange for the opportunity to work out on as many of you smug, tiresome, useless fucks as I could catch up with? Shit, how is that *not* worth it?

         The problem with a revolution against the oligarchy in America is that the left are on one hand either educated unarmed upper class liberals who have no illusions as to what such a war would do to their lifestyles, or on the other the poor mass of unorganized minorities who depend on said oligarchy for many fundamental needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only group with the balls to do this would be the white nationalist, religious fundamentalist,anti immigrant nativist, veterans, militias, and the general white middle management demographic. They have the arms and means to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Right now the oligarchy alongside traditionally conservative politicians have made an alliance with the fascist, like they usually do historically in such cases when they feel they could loose control.
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenge for them is to use them while not letting them get out of control.

         The ultimate betrayal of the US people, is actually characters like commenter #2 jps3 above  its the mafia of US lawyers and judges, in conjunction with the corporate media.  Of the many workers abused on the job, millions of them have tried to interest lawyers or the media in their plight, and got no help.
        </p>
        <p>
         The real taboo subject, the core US fact driving US fascism, is the US legal corruption, the moral breakdown of the US legal profession, who have become the Nazi party members serving the corporate monster. Half the lawyers in the US  nearly a million strong  are in the mafia with the judges, the other half wont fight that mafia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The legal organisations (ACLU etc) with money, are frauds which all suck the corporate nipple and do surface media things (war crimes accusations against Bush and other go-nowhere hokum), while ignoring the real plight of abused workers, and these lawyers and organisations ignore the hundreds of thousands of innocent working class people in the jails and prisons. A few exception cases here and there to superficially distract from the horrors, of course, but most victims are abandoned to their fates, left to rot and die, by the lawyers, after the lawyers milk them for every last dime.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the real subtext of this abused-workers story, is that the US mafia legal system totally failed these people. Anyone whos had much contact with the US lawyers knows what I mean  but most idiot middle-class Americans believe that lawyers are there to fight for them, like in some Hollywood movie, until they get arrested, or get their assets and children robbed from them by some lawyer bribing a judge, then they find out, too, what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are in the US and you have proof of legal-judicial crimes, the media wont cover the story, and no US lawyer will genuinely help you, even if you have hundreds of thousands to spend. That is real life fact most Americans dont know because the media hides it. Stories too scary for even the Exiled.
        </p>
        <p>
         Workers come to know and feel, that the whole US legal apparatus is a fraud. The weak government regulation is not the core issue  its the fact the US lawyer mafia is so shot through with corruption, that workers cant get help.
        </p>
        <p>
         If any lawyer tries to fight the US mafia, he or she gets disbarred or jailed (like the elderly Richard Fine in Los Angeles right now), the media buries the story and the other lawyers refuse to help him, the lawyers dont hit the streets demonstrating like in other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         The media corporations are the handmaiden, but the real US thugs escalating the Nazification of the US, are the legal-judicial mafia. Like other Americans, US lawyers, if not direct crooks, have gotten thoroughly beaten and cowed and trained, and the minority of lawyers with a conscience wont help victims out of fear.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is the real taboo topic that even the Exiled would be nervous about covering, if they had to name names, as the Exileds lawyers would advise them to shut up, and no lawyer would want to genuinely defend the Exiled as it was sued for a billion by the legal mafia and put out of business and blocked from the web for libel against US lawyers and judges.

         I keep seeing the question raised by multiple posters of what is there to be done (clearly, a question Ames wanted to provoke here), but the answer is simple: NOTHING.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the dawn of civilization, the low earnersthe bottom of the socioeconomic ladderhave ALWAYS been fucked over.  What the NYT coverage of this study revealed isnt news at all  This so-called study is just a brief stoplight on the long road of social history, which is traversed through largely unchanging terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
         As people are fond of saying in the corporate world, it is what it is.  This handy little tautology is used up and down the chain of command.  And its a good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because really, who gives a shit about the working and lower middle classes?  As long as they keep quiet, sweep up, pick up the phones courteously, etc

         Revolution and History: An Interview with Edward Hallett Carr
        </p>
        <p>
         Why does the worker in the West today  for I think we must accept the fact  not want revolution? The first answer is Fear, stimulated in part by the example of 1917. The Russian Revolution, whatever good ultimately came out of it, caused endless misery and devastation. To overthrow the ruling class in the capitalist world today would be a still more desperate enterprise, its costs even higher. The Russian worker in 1917 may have had nothing to lose but his chains. The western worker has far more than that to lose, and does not want to lose it. When this question is raised, I sometimes resort to an analogy. The doctor tells the patient that he has an incurable disease, which will get worse at an unpredictable rate, but that he may hope to carry on somehow for a few years longer. The disease can be cured by an operation, but there is quite a chance that the operation will kill the patient. The patient decides to carry on. Rosa Luxemburg said that the decay of capitalism would end either in socialism or in barbarism. I suspect that most workers today prefer to face the slow decay of capitalism, hoping that it will last out their time, rather than face the surgical knife of revolution, which may or may not produce socialism. It is a tenable point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
         We got consumerist society to deal with, something Marx did not foresee. Workers collaborate with their employers in the sense that they must have their goods sold to consumer tastes that have been and are constantly being changed by deceptive marketing strategies in order to be employed. This all rests on the Third World that the United States (and Britain, and the rest) have forced into binding trade pacts.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, revolutionary action is for these unfair trade practices to be severed in the Third World countries, and to properly proletarianize the First World workers who are little but glorified serfs. Its possible, but you have to work for it, hard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Or well just go fascist, which is great and all, but pretty vicious and unsustainable. Plus the vampires get to remain vampires, the class antagonism doesnt get resolved.

         Hey Mark, you gotta read The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists by Robert Tressell. He wrote it in 1910 but almost nothing changed since then, at least taking 1907 when the book takes place and 2009. Same domestic murder-suicides of people who worked all their lives only to have nothing left, same psychotic-sycophantic managers who had the chance to be the boss man but ended up working for him, same idiot proles who read the papers and argue about shit they dont understand like free trade, protectionism, immigrants, etc., defending the very system that causes their misery, same evangelist nuts who believe that youll have pie in the sky when you die, you get the point. I think there will be a way out of this though. I mean capital has limits.

         I think any attempt to impose a government solution is bound to fail.  Its already been noted by a few commentators that the US working class is more inclined towards fascism than socialism.  Add to this the very likely possibility that the oligarchs will continue to exercise some degree of control and you have the recreation of Berlin circa 1932.  Instead, why not give the American worker a taste of real capitalism.  Remove ALL government regulation and I believe well see one of two things.  Either the Austrian economists will be proven right in which case wealth will flow through a self-correcting market to everyone leading to a prosperous paradise or a barbaric, feudal form of capitalism will arise leading to the complete disillusionment of the common worker and socialist revolution.  Either way, its a win, as I see it.

         Anyone who thinks America is fascist country is completely ignorant of what fascism was and how important it was. Fascism doesnt mean corporations fuck you and steal from you non-stop. Thats just old-fashioned exploitation and imperialism.
        </p>

         Fascism was about politics as grand opera, with costumes, characters, parades, clubs, parties, art. It was a social movement. It was about gathering the losers and turning them into an army to unleash on the exploiters. It was the anti-Woodstock. America is not nearly cool enough for fascism. If Hitler were alive today he could take over America in a year and you would all have public health care the next day.

         The financial crisis was set off by a 4% drop in in consumer spending, from 70% of GDP in 2007 to 66% in 2008. You plebs control 40% of the economy, while the 10% rich have the rest

         @ 21 the disorganized minorities are pretty disarmed thanx to gun control laws. The Democrats they voted for will ironically screw them over by doing all they can to control guns. Plus All of Americas core ghetto inner city neighborhood are surrounded by white suburbia and as we all know there are WAY MORE GUNS in suburbia then there are in the ghettos. If you give them guns they will spend more time shooting each other over the most stupidest crap (like he stepped on my shoes, he looked at me funny) more and burning their own communities (&lt;putting their own people in worse economic shape as we saw in the LA riots when people lost their jobs bussineses were burnt down by stupid monkeys running loose). Plus they dont know anything about the Constitution and their rights thanx to government run schools public school.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rednecks as people like to call them/working class whites have basic technology skills (machining, farming, gunsmithing) people that are not to be f8cked with, while the leisure class pussy liberals have degrees in liberal arts and are educated. They wont be of any help to anybody but they will squeal to their elected officials for bigger government to control society more when disorder comes and more gun control. Plus gay rights, anti war movements and anti corporations of the yuppie liberals is of no interest of the minority.
        </p>
        <p>
         As for WN they are no better. What America will have left when these morons take over American streets will be basically third world where These WN militias keep destroying sh8t with all the battles, kinda like what you see in those worn torn African countries except the skin color of the militias will be white.

         Now the Dems are in power but are having a hard time, despite being in control, because those stupid uneducated hill billies actually do something about it and make WAY MORE NOISE and get more attention then all the gay lib protests of the last 8 years combined.

         The federal govt can over-tax the blue states, take their money and give it to GOP states, interfere in their 2nd amendment rights (blue states have strict gun laws), and still the educated libs living in confort wont do anything to fight for their rights, while the uneducated blacks cant do much.

         For reference, I used to work retail, many years ago, at, or just above minimum wage. First off, the survey was only of employees. Most employees who make minimum wage are normally not the cream of the crop. Many are under educated and/or not the sharpest tools in the shed. Are they aware of things like FICA deductions, state, federal and local income tax deductions, and the other types of deductions that almost everyone has.  Are they thinking that they are getting less than minimum wage because after all deductions they are?
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also be willing to bet that the people asking the questions to the employees (or if it was written) were probably not well vetted questions and written with a built in confirmation bias.  This is not to say that there is not a problem with off the book hours, and unwillingness of employers to have workers on overtime, just that I would not be surprised to see some loaded questions.

         Nr. 23 is quite right. Restrict consumption, draw as much money as you can from the fractional reserve banking system, strengthen the underground economy. And the plunder machine comes to a sudden halt. You may not have a pension plan to write home about, but (as a class) you have the power to fuck it up for everybody else. Politics is the art of obstruction.

         The mass of unorganized minorities put at least a million feet on the ground in the streets of Los Angeles on May Day 2006. Many of whom are veterans of various Central American civil wars and conflicts themselves.

         Its a silly stretch to think that those marchers can organize a military force that can go against the millions upon millions of heavily armed native Rednecks In fact I think @24 said summed it excellently. It would look like the Balkans without UN intervention(maybe without UN intervention, you know we got tons of nukes lying around)

         1) I agree America is not fascist in anyway, nor was GW Bush per say, though some of his policies were fascist like.
         <br/>
         2) When you talk of grand opera, costumes ,and clubs you are only describing fascism in its very late stages. Identifying fascism in its early stage is much more challenging
         <br/>
         3) Your forgetting that public health care for fascist includes work/death camps,bullets to the head, euthanasia, all the great things to help end end your life in a way beneficial to the community. Thats health care we can all support!

         As for the topic, heres the thing: Americans  if you arent getting paid what you are worth, form a union, stop working, beat the shit out of your boss. If a group of workers stampede a boss to death, there would be no one charged with murder. If bosses get the living shit beaten out of them, they will treat you better. You beat the crap out of a high school bully, and viola, he stops picking on you. Bosses are the same way. And when you strike, bear in mind, you co-workers wont stop you, and most will support you, its just that no one has the balls to make the first move.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our society today is like the Roman Society of Plebians and Patricians. So when the Patricians started to fuck over the Plebes, the Plebes simply left Rome. And the Patricians couldnt do jack shit about it, so they begged the Plebes to comeback and began fucking slaves instead, until Spartacus came along; and after Spartacus, the relations with slaves started improving.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course the Mass Media will tell you its hopeless. Thats what theyre paid to tell you. But its not. Knock out some windows on your bosses car, late at night, while no one is looking. That carries what, two weeks in jail, if youre dumb enough to be caught. But imagine the satisfaction. Start it out small, and then the momentum will build up. Revolt!

         #13 above is absolutely correct; Lawyers and judges literally have a captive monopoly in which they have myriad laws that us peons often know nothing about, as well as thousands of regulations and laws that serve to squeeze money from the peon (non legal)class.  The lawyers and judges pretend to process justice via rigged court proceedings, juries that are given instructions by judges as to what they can see hear and think, and supposedly opposing lawyers who pretend to fight for each others client but are, in actuality, drinking buddies at their country clubs.  What they are really doing is perpetuating a money transfer business wherein the judges are assured of continued bureaucratic power and money, the lawyers are assured of an endless stream of cases from which they can extract fees that allow them to live in the upper economic crusts, and the government bureaucrats are assured of always having a job processing the paper from the lawyers and judges.
         <br/>
         The system is totally corrupt and non reformable.  Read Adventures in Legal Land.

         George Orwell didnt know what the hell he wanted and yes authors can be wrong about their own work see Heinlein and Starship Troopers.  1984 comparisons fit more than ever.  You have a huge underclass of retarded rednecks defending their ass rape by authority and content to stew at home consuming pornography and you have a system where no one can complain about anything and not support the troops or you get labeled a Communist by some faggot.

         Why does no one challenge one of the most central assumptions of Marks argument: the notion that there is something inherently WRONG with having a permanent underclass that is continuously abused in a society.
        </p>
        <p>
         While I would still advocate that they deserve some basic rights (affordable health-care, minimum wage, housing), I only support them having these rights for a simple reason: we need them to be strong and healthy to do the work of dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
         A permanent underclass is fine. You can escape such conditions if you have the brains, ambition, and the basic conditions I outlined earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I for one derive much pleasure from watching the filth repair my roads, cook my food, and perform other degrading labor. So long as the shitty system holds up, anyone with a brain should be fine.

         Its not just minimum wage workers. Middle class workers get cheated too. Since I became an RN, I get cheated more than any other job I ever had. Sometimes, just big mistakes, like $800 in the check and they keep putting off fixing it. Also, required to punch in and out for 1/2 lunch, but never get to take it so it is time stolen from my paycheck. Then, many places forbid overtime, but the work must be finished that shift, so people punch out at 3pm, then come back and do two or more hours of free overtime almost every day. It is really rare for a nurse to ever get out of work on time. They also want you there 1/2 early, but arent allowed to punch in until 7AM or whatever time your shift starts. One place, where we signed in at the supervisors office instead of clocked in, I was asked to stay extra every night as the nightshift was always late. She then lied and never turned in that extra time. The best was a psych facility that had a time clock that didnt print anything on our cards. They said the night supervisor would have to sign them in order to get paid, to prove we were there. I went to her office, she was drunk and refused. This went on for weeks, no one getting paid right. Management sneared at us. Finally, someone poured coffee in the time clock. It exploded and they had to put in one that worked. So, professionals get cheated, too, just in different way. We also dont get time &amp; half for mandated shifts anymore, no weekend or holiday bonuses. I have been told to work a Christmas or Thanksgiving, and we would at least be given dinner. Then, nothing. There was no place open to buy anything for anyone who didnt take a lunch. Some places, the nurses have to buy supplies, such as alcohol, gauze, tylenolthey dont provide basic things patients need, even meals.

         You have a huge underclass of retarded rednecks defending their ass rape by authority and content to stew at home consuming pornography and they are also content with the entertaintment they have on television in the form of Fox News. Lets face it, Fox News IS ENTERTAINING and they have high ratings because of it while left wing news is boring as hell and wont catch the attention of the retarded right winger. The retarded right wingers are also content and satisfied so as long as the Federal Govt. gives free money to his state so he can build bridges and highways to nowhere and keep his working class white male construction worker job. Which brings up another point: LOWER THE FRIGGIN TAXES and the state/local/municipal government wont have money for their white male construction worker job then they will beat the asses out of their bosses when they dont have jobs. But the liberal left is too stupid to figuere this out and instead tax to death their own states which ends up supporting them in the first place. LOWER TAXES dumb ass liberal left.

        <p>
         this is a classic case point where #38s solution of beating the crap out of your bosses will work and they will stop being assholes and form unions. If the local municipal/city/state govt. tries to water hoes the union exercise your 2nd amendment rights that our forefathers gave us and then they will take you seriously. Which brings up another point: STOP PUTTING RESTRICTION ON GUNS and passing gun control laws retarded, dumb ass liberal left wingers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gawd liberal left wingers are so stupid and retarded they tax to death their own states and give the money to these dumb asses while at the same time restricting their own right to own a firearm in their own state.

         In any future revolt, red necks and the various minorities would all fight with each other, and suck up to the oligarchs.  The attitude I may not amount to shit but Im still better than a nigger (redneck, gook, spic, etc) is still common.  The religious right would probably do the worst atrocities: got to smite the heathen, you know.

         In the ideal world I just articulated, there would be no need to measure intelligence and ambition. So long as their basic needs are provided, those who possess such traits will likely rise up to the challenge. The weak will make way for the strongit is the way of the universe.

         The religious right would probably do the worst atrocities which is why our founding fathers gave us the god given right to bear arms to protect against tyranny, weather it be form out of control government or pig ignorant facist right wingers. Yet the democrats keep putting restrictions on guns and anti-gun people are brainwashed into believing that guns kill people we should restrict them while it was It was President George Bush, Sr. who banned the import of assault weapons in 1989, and promoted the view that Americans should only be allowed to own weapons suitable for sporting purposes. It was It was Governor Ronald Reagan of California who signed the Mulford Act in 1967, prohibiting the carrying of firearms on ones person or in a vehicle, in any public place or on any public street. The law was aimed at stopping the Black Panthers, but affected all gun owners. Twenty-four years later, Reagan was still pushing gun control. I support the Brady Bill, he said in a March 28, 1991 speech, and I urge the Congress to enact it without further delay.

         @54..all you commenters decry so called liberals yet every time i ask you what a liberal is you can never define the term except to say jane fonda is one of them. as used by most of you, liberal is just a label used to identify those who you feel are un-american, unchristian, or who want gun control. sorry, but that just doesnt cut it. i can tell you there are an awful lot of well armed liberals out there that will never give up their guns so long as there are ignorant ,know-nothing assholes who want to force jesus down everyones throat.

         Riots wont happen because N. Americans live in communities that are suburbanized and theres no place to assemble or protest. The only places that will have riots will be in the old inner city ghetto centers. But even they wont have much of an impact and will only frighten the already sheltered their whole lives suburbanites even more into a police state and guns/religion clinging.

         In the two months I worked for Safeway in Campbell, California (at the corner of Budd &amp; Winchester), I dont think they failed to underpay me (missing hours) on a single one of my weekly paychecks.  And that wasnt even one of the major reasons I quit that job in frustrated disgust.  I was working my ass off for that $8.70/hour they were paying, by the way, and still not even getting all of it.  I hate to say it, but its the damn truth, and the truth needs to stated openly:  Some of the Capitalists need to get waxed in this country, in order to put the fear of God into them.  Im not advocating illegal violence; Im just stating my opinion that its almost inevitable arrival has the distinct potential to be a good thing.
