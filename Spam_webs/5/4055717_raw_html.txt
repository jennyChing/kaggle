        FUNDRAISERS IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET
       </h5>
       <img align="right" alt="Fundraising" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/Time-To-Give-Clock.jpg"/>
       Planning a fundraiser in the 21st century has been made much simpler thanks to the Internet. The web has made it much easier to collect 
	information, conduct research and enhance communication amongst participants, donors and sponsors before and after events. The best way to 
	update and inform invitees and participants is through a fundraising website that acts as an e-commerce and communication center. With this 
	website you can disseminate important fundraising details, collect information, make donations, sell tickets, create a buzz and so much more. Being able collect payments and donations online is also a major benefit. With this fundraising website you can disseminate important fundraising details, collect information, share the event with your network using social media, collect donations, sell tickets, have others raise money on behalf of your cause with personal/team fundraising pages,  create a buzz and so much more.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the past, creating a website required a lot of technical skills and knowledge that the average person did not have. Thanks to "do it yourself" event website builders such as Myevent.com, the task of creating an event website incorporating online fundraising capabilities such as online donations and personal fundraising pages is extremely easy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This book is intended to teach you how to get the most out of online fundraising even if you have little or no experience.
       <br/>

        PART I: CHOOSE AN EVENT

       Regardless of how big or small your event may be, in order to be successful and raise the most money possible  for your cause, you need to come up with a detailed plan. This section summarizes the beginning steps required when planning your fundraising event. This book can provide you with tips whether you have 1 year, 6 months or 1 month to plan. You should ideally start planning 12 months in advance of the event but if you only have 6 months or less, you can still pull it off. Keep in mind that if you have less time you may need to select an appropriate fundraising event or adjust your timeline accordingly.  (Tip: Incorporating online fundraising into your detailed plan will save you a lot of time and money.)

       <h2>
        Chapter 1: Planning Your Event
       </h2>
       Whether you are working with an organization or all by yourself, you need to find the perfect fundraising event idea to help you achieve your goal. Today there are so 
	many ways to create an interesting customized event to raise money for your cause. Some events require a lot more planning than others, and you should consider the 
	following when selecting what type of fundraising event you want to have:
       <br/>
       <div style="padding-left:30px">
        1. Time you have to plan
        <br/>
        2. Budget
        <br/>
        3. Purpose of event
        <br/>
        4. Goal
        <br/>
        5. Appeal to target audience
        <br/>
       </div>
       If you only a few weeks to plan, it will limit the type of fundraising event you can have as it will be harder to secure a location, caterer, sponsors and prizes. Regardless of the time you may have, you can still organize a very successful fundraiser that will achieve your mission of building awareness, generating funds or providing new equipment to those who need it. How much you have to spend "up front" on the event will dictate the type of fundraising event you can plan. Online fundraising will save you money as it eliminates postage and printing expenses.  Costs and time required need to be considered and funds need to be carefully allocated.

       <h5>
        PRIMARY QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN PLANNING YOUR FUNDRAISING EVENT
       </h5>
       <b>
        a) What type of event will you hold?
       </b>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your target audience needs to be kept in mind when making a decision regarding which type of fundraising event you want to have. It will need to engage the 
	audience you are trying to attract so that they will be more inclined to participate, attend, sponsor, donate and spread the word about the event. You need to think of your 
	network and consider what type of event they would enjoy taking part in. For example, holding a golf fundraiser has become quite popular as it is a great way for people to 
	spend the day with close friends while raising money for a good cause. Although tournaments have the capability to raise a lot of money, if your target audience does not enjoy 
	golf, it is not the right choice for your event.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your budget does play a huge role in determining the type of event you can have because certain events require money up front for deposits. The size of your budget may 
	be determined by how many sponsors you are able to secure. The key is to try and get as much stuff donated as possible and get as many sponsors as you can.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        b) When and where will you hold the event?
       </b>
       <br/>
       Location is a key element to your fundraiser as it sends a message regarding the type of event you will be holding. You need to plan at least 6 months in advance to make sure you can secure the ideal location or venue for your fundraising event
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When to have your fundraising event must also be considered. If your event is to be held outdoors, such as a walk, run or bike, then the event should be held between 
	June and August as it will be the most comfortable weather for the participants. Ski-a-thons and skate-a-thons will need to be held in between December-February to ensure the 
	best conditions. Weather dependant events are always risky, and you should always have a back-up plan and be able to do something indoors.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        TIP
       </b>
       - It is important to secure the registration fees ahead of time and not on the day of the event. The reason is that if 
	the event has to be cancelled due to bad weather you will still have the revenue to pay for everything. If you are counting on collecting money only on the day of the event 
	and the weather is bad you may end up with a very low turn-out and no money to pay for all your expenses. It is also important to mention that tickets will not be refunded in 
	case of bad weather. Most people understand that and are mostly participating because they want to support the cause.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You should always make sure that there is parking available close to the location for all of your guests, or offer a valet service. The venue should also be large enough for everyone 
	to be seated comfortably and have enough room for walking and dancing (if you have music and dancing). When organizing a walkathon, race or treasure hunt, for example, 
	the decision of where it will take place needs significant consideration as details and routes will need to be carefully established, permits obtained and security hired, well in advance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        c) Who can you get to sponsor your event?
       </b>
       <br/>
       Your budget and how much money you raise will be largely etermined by how many sponsors you get. You need a lot of time to be able to do this properly. The first place to look 
	for sponsors is by reaching out to those who have a stake in your cause. Businesses or families that have an attachment 
	to your cause are often willing to help raise money by being a sponsor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In addition to the people who have an interest in your cause you should try and get specific services sponsored by businesses associated with that service. For example, you 
	can approach a restaurant to supply the food for the event. This will cost the restaurant less money because their costs are lower and they will get the added benefit of gaining 
	exposure.
       <br/>
       If you are unable to get a specific business to donate that service, then you should try and package that service as a sponsorship opportunity. For example a bank can still 
	sponsor the dinner for the event. You can package almost anything as a sponsorship opportunity and offer exposure in return for their sponsorship. It is much easier to approach 
	a potential sponsor and offer them publicity at your event in exchange for their sponsorship instead of just saying can you give me money to help us. Below are some examples of 
	what you can offer as a sponsorship package:
       <img align="right" alt="Fundraising" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/Sponsorship.jpg" style="margin-top:8px;margin-right:360px"/>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Food
        </li>
        <li>
         Beverage
        </li>
        <li>
         Alcohol
        </li>
        <li>
         Music
        </li>
        <li>
         Venue
        </li>
        <li>
         Loot bags
        </li>
        <li>
         Prizes
        </li>
       </ul>
       These are just a few examples. You can have different levels of sponsorship as well. For example many events have one large sponsor that gives you the most money and they get mentioned on everything (signage, tickets, website etc...).You can reach more potential sponsors by featuring and promoting different sponsorship opportunities on your fundraising website and allow sponsors to purchase sponsorship packages online in exchange for exposure at your event and on your fundraising website.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Ad Book:
       </b>
       <br/>
       An ad book is a great way to raise a lot of money to help pay for many expenses of the event and raise extra funds. You can have many different size ads (full page, half page, 
	quarter page and business card). An ad book can take a lot of time to plan and execute properly so you need time to reach out to potential sponsors, organize the artwork, find a printer etc.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Another option is to offer sponsors an online Ad Book. This reduces the costs a lot because you don't need a printer! You simply create a page or different areas on your 
	event website where you will promote your sponsors. You can link to their website and large sponsors can have more information about their business. In some ways this 
	is even better than an ad book that you print and distribute because it is less expensive to produce so the charity gets more money and you can give the sponsor even more 
	publicity. You can even collect the money for the ads and the artwork through your MyEvent.com fundraising event website.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can ask anyone to sponsor you! Potential sponsors are everywhere and do not necessarily need to be related to the event. The best way to start is by asking your family, 
	friends, colleagues and other members of your network. Committee members should do the same. By encouraging your network to spread the word to theirs, you will have 
	the potential to reach a wide array of potential sponsors. If you are organizing a golf tournament, you can contact your local golf store, pro shops, and golf courses to see if 
	they want to be involved. You can also visit your favorite stores and restaurants and ask if they would sponsor your events.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Being a sponsor is also a good business opportunity, and many companies have an allocated budget for this.)
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        d) Are you going to need prizes and have giveaways?
       </b>
       <br/>
       Most fundraising events have prizes for raffle winners or a trophy for the champion(s) of a race, golf tournament or talent show. Mentioning and featuring prizes that can be won on your fundraising website is a great way to build excitement amongst guests and participants. Prizes should be creative and related to the event, therefore you need to start planning early as getting the goods and customizing them can take time. In order to reduce expenses, you can try and get the prizes and giveaways donated. For a golf tournament, you can ask the golf pro shop for free or discounted goods such as golf bag, balls, golf attire, etc.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Giving out loot bags is common at fundraising events. They can be filled with donated goods such as pens with sponsor's names, restaurant vouchers, a gift certificate for 
	a free golf lesson, or apparel with the organization or sponsors logo. The more cool stuff you can get for your loot bag the better. Once again the key is to try and get 
	stuff donated. Sometimes it can be one item that is very much in demand that year or several smaller items that all have some value. Tip: Having a great loot bag is one of the 
	secrets to having an event that everyone wants to attend year after year.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        e) Is there going to be food?
       </b>
       <a href="http://www.fundraising.myevent.com" rel="external" title="Create a Fundraiser Website">
        <img align="right" alt="Fundraiser Website" border="0" src="http://www.myevent.com/images/sites/banners/Fundraiser/120x600_fundraising.jpg" style="margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:10px"/>
       </a>
       <br/>
       Regardless of the type of event you choose, you should always have something to eat and drink to offer your guests. It doesn't necessarily have to be a full meal, but 
	snacks and water bottles should always be available. Sponsors can donate snacks and drinks for the event with their name and logo on it. If you are organizing a 
	walk-a-thon or a golf tournament, which usually begins early, a small buffet breakfast can be included in the registration fee. Some venues have restaurants that can 
	supply food for free or at a discount or you can go to local restaurants and ask them to cater the event.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        f) Will you need volunteers?
       </b>
       <br/>
       With any event you choose, you will always need help whether it's with setting up, checking in registrants and guests, serving food, or directing people to the right area. 
	The easiest way to get people to volunteer is to just ask them for their help. You can start off by simply asking friends, colleagues and family members who will be happy 
	to help, or you can reach out to others who want to help your cause.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        g) Who is the beneficiary?
       </b>
       <br/>
       Having a slideshow or video can personalize the event by sharing stories of why you are holding this event, and about the organization being supported. You can 
	demonstrate why the money is needed and where donations from previous fundraisers went. You can also have information about the beneficiary and how the
	money raised will help the cause on your website and in print at the event.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        h) Host or Guest Speaker
       </b>
       <br/>
       Many fundraising events have hosts. It can be you, another participant, or anyone from the organization. The host welcomes participants or guests, takes them through the 
	event schedule, thanks sponsors and attendee, and makes closing remarks. Hosts will need time to learn about the cause being supported. Having a guest of honor or a guest 
	speaker at your event is a great way to build excitement and sell more tickets as people are drawn to events where they are eager to meet and hear from a person of interest. 
	Arranging to have them at your event can take time due to scheduling conflicts, therefore the guest of honor or guest speaker needs to be determined early in the planning 
	process. The honored guest or speaker could be a member or client of the organization you are raising money for, who can let the attendees know how much their contributions 
	help. Other possible speakers for your event include community leaders, well known business people, elected officials, etc.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you can manage to get a celebrity at your event this can add a lot of excitement to the event and get your event more publicity. The best way to get a celebrity is to find one 
	that has an attachment to the cause. For example if you are having an event to benefit Leukemia and it is well known that a particular athlete or Television host has a child that 
	suffers from that disease, they may have a special interest in helping your event be successful.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The ambience of your event always requires advanced planning. The theme of the event, dress code and booking of entertainment needs to be thought of early on so it can 
	be incorporated into the invitations, selection of venue, and shape the overall type of event you want to have.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <h5>
        Chapter 2: Recruit A Planning Committee
       </h5>
       <br/>
       A fundraising event requires a lot of planning and organizing. In order to facilitate the process, you can develop a committee where tasks and responsibilities can be delegated. The size of 
	committee you should have is dependent on the amount of planning necessary for the event you choose. The committee usually consists of 5-10 members. You can ask close friends or 
	family members or other contacts to take part. They can help share all the tasks that go into planning the event you have chosen. Tasks can include getting sponsors, choosing a venue, 
	selecting a caterer, managing the website, setting up the day of the event, inviting guests, selling tickets, getting sponsors, coordinating loot bags, managing an ad book, prizes, PR, 
	Auctions, and fundraising. Committee members should ideally be as diverse as possible and from different social circles.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img align="right" alt="Committee" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/committee-meeting.png" style="margin-bottom:10px"/>
       One of the most important roles of the committee is to get sponsors in one way or another, and create a lot of interest so there is a lot of participation in your event. You want to 
	recruit those who have a large personal network and the ability to sell tickets and fundraise. Each committee member may have a particular task such as food, or venue but 
	everyone should use their social networks to try and get sponsors and donations. You must keep your committee motivated by providing them with regular progress updates, 
	offer support and guidance, and reminding each member of their goal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Each committee member should have one or more specific responsibilities. One committee member should be in charge of invitations another can be in charge of catering, and 
	another in charge of the website. If certain individuals have specific talents, be sure to put them in charge appropriate tasks. As an example an accountant should be in charge of the 
	finances, someone with connections to a printer can be in charge of the ad book and so on... Time management is crucial to success. You need to write down dates in a calendar, 
	send out reminders and ensure that everyone is meeting their deadlines.
       <br/>

        REGISTRATION
       </h5>
       <br/>
       In order to participate in any fundraising event, participants need to register, and usually pay a registration fee. The registration form should be short and sweet and only ask 
	for mandatory information, including; first name, last name, e-mail address. From event to event different information is relevant and required. Using MyEvent.com 
	you can customize your registration form according to the specifics of your event.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       MyEvent.com offers all kinds of customized registration tools including a free and paid registration option. With MyEvent.com fundraising websites, participants can register and pay the registration fee online, making it simpler for both planners and participants. The fee to participate will range from one event to another and will usually depend on if there will be food, entertainment and prizes at the event. If you decide to hold a free event, you can still  have guests register for your event using the tickets feature and setting up a $0 ticket. You will save money on postage and avoid paperwork because all the reports are ready for you in your control panel.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        TIP:
       </b>
       You can offer participants an early bird registration price with a clearly stated cut off date. Reminders of early bird specials can be featured on the website calendar and 
	sent out using the broadcast email tool. The registration fee can also be made non refundable, however this may deter participants from registering early. A link to your 
	registration form should be accessible from multiple areas, including the website, e-mails, and social media outlets.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You need to make sure that the registration process is simple, fast and easy. It is important that each step is a positive experience so that participants are happy to be a 
	part of the event and are more likely to share and encourage others to take part.

       <img align="left" alt="Online fundraising" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/ebook_save-the-date.jpg" style="margin-right:15px;"/>
       Sending out a fun and informative "save the date" is a great way to create a buzz about your fundraising event. The main purpose is to let people know about your event and why they should attend or participate. It is a call to action as you are asking people to add the event to their calendars. It should be colorful and attention grabbing, however not too long. It is so easy to do using your MyEvent.com website as it can easily be sent out online using the broadcast email tool. Sending out a "save the date" is effective for any event, however more important for larger fundraisers such as galas or walks. The "save the date" should include the type of event, date and location. Making people aware of the event way in advance is a way to maximize RSVPs. The "save the date" can encourage people to visit the website and inform details about how to register online. You can even include a short personal note letting people know about the cause you are fundraising for, why you are involved and why they should help.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <h5>
        SEND OUT INVITES
       </h5>
       Regardless of the type of event you will be holding, you will need to send out invites. Invites can now be sent out online using the broadcast email tool available on MyEvent.com 
	fundraising websites. This eliminates the hassle, costs and effort of printing and postage. Even if you feel the need to send out a paper invitation by snail mail you should 
	definitely encourage people to RSVP online. Invitations should be sent about 3 months before the event. Depending on your event, invitations should re-iterate the key 
	information such as time, date, location, food, entertainment, guest of honor or guest speaker and prizes.
	Instructions on how to register, purchase tickets, and donate  online should also be provided.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You want to encourage people to purchase their tickets quickly and you should therefore offer them incentives to do so. You can offer early bird specials and quantity discounts.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        TIP:
       </b>
       Incorporating a contest, such as "buy your tickets before October 31st and you will be entered into a draw to win your tickets and a free dinner" will push people to 
	purchase earlier. You can mention that they will receive 100% refund if they cannot attend, therefore there is no reason not to purchase tickets today. Stating that tickets 
	can be purchased online from the website using their credit card will increase purchases as it is much more convenient then having to write a check and mail it in. People have 
	come to expect this from all fundraising events. The nice thing about sending online invitations is you can send them more than once as a reminder if you have not received a response.
       <img align="right" alt="Fundraising Reminder" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/ebook-follow-up.jpg"/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Follow-ups are very necessary and serve as a reminder. Two weeks following the initial invitation email, a second 
	invitation to non responders can be sent, however you should change the subject line, look of invitation and 
	include cut off dates of early bird pricing. A third invitation can be sent out about a month after that, and the subject line should once again be changed. A 
	forth invitation can be sent out about a month prior to the event and should include a personal note to persuade people to sign up. It should also indicate that time and spots 
	are limited and only a few days left to be able to participate and make a difference. A final invitation can be sent 2 weeks before the event simply reminding people o f 
	the date of the event and that this is the last chance to register.

	tweet about the fundraiser to your Twitter followers, or send a broadcast message to your Facebook friends in an instant all directly from your fundraising event website. If 
	at all possible get a celebrity to tweet about your event. You can create a Facebook event page and share the link on your event website. You can also consider forming a

       This is a way to get people to keep coming back to the website. You can include how many people have registered, names of most recent registered participants, names of 
	most recent contributors and other news about your event. You can also create a page to highlight the top fundraiser of the week. It can be an opportunity for others to learn 
	information about other participants, teams and personal stories of why they are involved and raising money. The website can also feature a fundraising "tip of the week" to 
	encourage daily website visits. For events such as races and treasure hunts, you can post occasional clues on the website, so that viewers can get ahead of their competition.

       Regardless of the type of fundraising event you choose to have, the primary purpose is to raise awareness and money to support the cause. Every event, from a marathon, to a dinner, involves soliciting friends, family, colleagues and other people from your network in order to raise the largest amount of money possible for your cause.

Being able to accept donations online makes it easier to attain and surpass your goal. MyEvent.com can provide you with all the tools you need to facilitate all of your online fundraising needs.

       </h5>
       <br/>
       Using a MyEvent.com website to raise money for your fundraising event makes giving and receiving donations fast and easy. The best part is that it can all be done online by creating a simple donation webpage to share your story and collect money online or by building full fundraising website with integrated fundraising tools and pages.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can promote your fundraising campaign online by including a link to your website on social networking sites which leads viewers directly to the donation page on your 
	website. By emphasizing how easy it is to donate online, you can raise more funds including from people who could not attend the event. You can track all incoming fundraising 
	donations in real time so you are always aware of how close you are to achieving your goal. Each fundraising page has a dynamic graphic thermometer to demonstrate this as well. 
	Donors names and contributions can remain on the site for the duration of the event and they can post regards and words of encouragement.

       <h5>
        PERSONAL FUNDRAISING PAGES
       </h5>
       In addition to having a general donations page on your website, participants in your event can also fundraise by getting their own personal fundraising page that they will share with their network. Whether you are raising money for yourself, a loved one, cause, or charity, this type of personal fundraising has become very popular and successful and now you can do it easily through MyEvent.com. Traditionally the kinds of events that lend themselves to this kind of personal fundraising by participants are physical sporting events like walks, runs, bowl a thons, etc...You wouldn't think of asking people who are attending a gala to fundraise for your event, however you could ask people on the committee of any event to get a page and reach out to their networks. You might be surprised how much more money you will raise with this strategy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       MyEvent.com offers both a personal fundraising page and a team fundraising page. Individuals with personal fundraising pages can fundraise alone, start a team or join 
	a team. Team fundraising is fun and creates a competitive environment. Once a participant is registered, they will receive access to their own personal fundraising webpage 
	and be searchable on the team fundraising page if they are on a team. A team fundraising page can be set up in seconds. All that is required is for one person to start a 
	team, the captain, and then others will be able to join. Once the fundraising pages have been created, participants can begin to promote their involvement with the cause 
	amongst their network of family, friends and co-workers. Those who have been asked to donate will be brought directly to the participant or team page where they can 
	donate online and browse the rest of the website. Both personal and team fundraising pages can incorporate text, photos and videos, thermometer displaying goals, and donor names and comments.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img align="left" alt="Team" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/ebook_team.jpg" style="margin-bottom:10px"/>
       A personal fundraising page allows the participant to explain their attachment to the cause whether it be through sharing stories, pictures or videos. The participant 
	can personalize their page and explain why they are participating, and why they want to raise money for that particular cause. When fundraising in teams, each team will 
	get their own page that lists the individuals that are fundraising for that team with links to their personal fundraising page. Many fundraising events have proven 
	that team fundraising increases donations due to the friendly competition that develops especially since each website has a leader board. Participants have more fun and 
	more money is raised for the cause when fundraising in teams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Regardless if fundraising alone or in teams, fundraising pages should be personalized and should reveal that you are passionate about what you are doing. Encourage 
	participants to include as much information as possible including who the beneficiary of the fundraiser is and what their connection is to the charity. People want to support 
	you because of how much you care about the cause, therefore your dedication must be clearly communicated through your fundraising page.

        Chapter 8: How to Obtain Sponsorships
       </h5>
       <br/>
       Potential sponsors are everywhere. You can ask anyone to be a sponsor. Obtaining sponsorships is an excellent way to save money and cut administrative costs. Sponsors do not 
	have to relate to the cause or event you are planning, but your chances are much higher of getting a sponsor that has an interest in your cause. For example you may get a venue 
	to donate its premises if the owner has a relative inflicted with the disease you are raising money for. You should reach out to potential sponsors at least 6 months prior to 
	the event if possible. In order to get a sponsor to say yes to you over other people or organizations, you need to be creative and stand out. Your first contact with potential 
	sponsors should involve a personal approach and demonstrate why you are supporting the cause and how their contribution can help.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you cannot get a sponsor that is attached to the event because they have a common interest in raising money for your charity, you may find one that can benefit from the 	
	exposure. A new restaurant may be interested to donate the food for one of the meals at the event in exchange for exposure through your website, and marketing materials. 
	With your fundraising website, it is so easy to become a sponsor by signing up and paying right on the website. A sponsor's page can also feature the sponsors and have links 
	to their website allowing them to gain more exposure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Having a particular sponsor support your cause can draw people to your event. Sponsors are important to the success of your fundraising event because they add value as well as 
	marketing and promotional outlets.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img align="left" alt="Sponsors" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/ebook_join-cause.jpg" style="margin-right:15px"/>
       <b>
        TIP:
       </b>
       If you can get media sponsors such as a TV or Radio station they can bring a lot of free publicity to your event. Fundraisers and sponsorship 
	opportunities are great business partnerships. For example, if a local restaurant logo will be advertised at your event. The restaurant should 
	also be advertising your event to build awareness and interest amongst their clients. This sort of promotion is helpful because people are more inclined to be part of 
	causes their favorite places are involved in. Sponsors can also provide goods such as snacks and apparel with their logo on it, or supply products for event loot bags. 
	The best way to get sponsors is to reach out to your networks of family, friends and colleagues and encourage others to do the same. If you can get your contacts to 
	spread the word about your event with their networks, it will make the process of building awareness and obtaining sponsorships much easier.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you cannot get sponsors that have an attachment to the cause and you were not able to find sponsors in specific 
	areas who could benefit from the exposure, then you should break up as many activities as you can and offer them up as sponsorship opportunities. Examples of 
	sponsorship opportunities are; meal, bar, golf carts (if it s a golf tournament), signage, music, venue...you get the idea. You can package virtually anything as a sponsorship 
	opportunity and that way you are not just approaching a potential sponsor and saying give me money; you can offer something in return  advertising and exposure.

        Ad Book.
       </b>
       An ad book is a great way to raise money. You can have many different size ads for different prices and offer exposure to your sponsors in exchange for a paid ad. 
	You can also offer exposure on the website in addition to the ad book. If you are on a tight budget you may want to forgo the ad book and only give sponsors visibility on the 
	website and save the costs to print the book (which can be a lot of money).

       A way to raise even more money at your fundraising event is to have an auction. You can choose whether or not you want to run a physical auction or an online auction for your 
	event. MyEvent.com makes it so simple and easy to set up an online auction where people bid on items online. An online auction has proven to be more successful than a 
	silent auction because people are usually too busy socializing during the event and do not always have a chance to see and bid on items. Whether or not you are 
	planning on physically holding an auction at your event, you can use MyEvent.com's online auction features to exhibit the items. This is a way to get guests to see and 
	learn the descriptions about what is being offered prior to the event. Donors can simply submit products and services for the auction directly through your fundraising website. 
	These people or companies will benefit from the added exposure they will receive.
       <br/>
       The entire system is automated and you can receive optional email notifications every time a bid is made at your auction. Guests can bid on items prior to the event, and 
	there is also the option to set a "Buy It Now" price. All payments can be made directly from the website using a credit card. Restaurant gift certificates, hotel stays and 
	event tickets are some examples of great auction items.

        ADVANTAGES OF AN ONLINE AUCTION
       </h5>
       <b>
        1. More time
       </b>
       <br/>
       Guests can take time to familiarize themselves with the items being auctioned as they can view them and their descriptions online prior to the event.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        2. More money
       </b>
       <br/>
       With the ability to provide a longer time period to make bids, it will increase the overall price you will get for the item.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        3. More items to donate

        Chapter 10: Raffles
       </h5>
       <br/>
       Raffles are a simple and easy way to raise more money at your event. Your costs are minimal, and the proceeds reflect the number of tickets sold. With a raffle you can achieve 
	high profit margins. If you can get the prizes for your raffle donated, the only costs are the printing of the raffle tickets which can perhaps be donated as well or you can use very 
	inexpensive raffle tickets. Raffles are great for any type of event or any number of participants or guests. You can sell tickets to the raffle online through your website quickly 
	and easily and without a merchant account, and display information and pictures about the prize.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Great prizes are essential for the success of your raffle. When deciding on what kind of prizes you should have, you need to consider what your potential supporters will value. 
	Some examples of prizes that attract attention include; new car, free trip or cruise, electronic equipment (TVs, iPods), or gift certificates to local stores and restaurants.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How to go about getting these costly prizes is something you need to consider. The best way is to ask members of your network if they have something of value to contribute 
	or if they know of someone who can. Try and get people that sympathize with your cause to donate prizes.
       <img align="right" alt="Raffle" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/ebook_raffle.jpg"/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In order to raise funds, the ticket price for your raffle needs to be high enough to reflect the value of the prize but not too high to deter people from purchasing. You need to 
	think about your audience when deciding on ticket prices and think about how much your supporters would be willing to spend on a ticket. The bigger the prize, the more 
	you can charge. If you sell a lot of tickets then you can lower the price of each ticket accordingly. On the other hand people might feel they have a better chance of 
	winning if you do not offer too many tickets. This all has to be considered when planning your raffle.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Raffle tickets can be purchased at the event or perhaps can include the option of purchasing raffle tickets, along with your event ticket, online. Using MyEvent.com, you can even create a simple and free webpage to just sell raffle tickets online prior to your event. Raffle prizes can be featured on the website which will notify people about the raffle and at the same time build excitement about what they can possibly win.

       </h5>
       <img align="left" alt="Online Fundraising" src="/images/sites/fundraising2012/ebook_thank-you.jpg"/>
       <br/>
       Regardless of the type of event you have, once the fundraising event is complete you should send a thank you email to all guests, participants, committee members, 
	volunteers, sponsors and donors for their contributions. It should re-iterate the purpose of the event, where the money donated is going and how much the event raised. 
	Photos and videos should be uploaded onto the fundraising event website. 	
	Emails should be sent out to all attendees encouraging them to post any pictures they took 
	throughout the event on the website or on social media sites as well as provide any feedback or suggestions on the message board. You should follow through with any 
	outstanding orders or donations made at the event. You should have a post-fundraiser committee meeting two weeks after your event to celebrate a job well done and to 
	discuss what worked, and what could be improved for the next event.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You should attempt to keep the lines of communication open, especially if you are planning annual events, by sending out e-newsletters which can provide information 
	and updates about how the money raised is making a difference. If, for an example, you are holding an event to raise money to purchase new equipment for breast cancer 
	detection, you can select a day whereby participants can go to the hospital and see the new equipment that was purchased and hear from doctors and patients how it has 
	been saving lives.

       The Fundraising A Thon can be a highly effective way to raise money for a cause or an organization. These types of events require a considerable amount of planning, however, 
the end result is great. In a typical a-thon, participants register to participate in the event, sometimes for a fee. Participants then solicit donations (or sponsors) from their 
network of family, friends and colleagues. The fundraising process can be made simple, fast, and easy to manage using MyEvent.com's Personal and Team 
fundraising features. Participants can sign up and pay registration fees online on the event website. In order to raise the largest amount of money for the cause, each team 
is assigned their own fundraising web page. An individual fundraising page can also be obtained. These pages can display the goal your team is striving to achieve, and a 
thermometer to see how close you are to raising this amount. Using the built in features offered by MyEvent.com, participants can broadcast and promote their 
cause to their network of family, friends and colleagues through email, Facebook, Twitter, other social media outlets. Obtaining sponsorships and having online auctions 
are other ways you can raise even more money. Some of the challenges you may come across while planning an "a-thon" are; finding a suitable root/location, 
clearly marking the route, obtaining necessary permits and permissions, safety, recruiting enough volunteers, providing water and possibly snacks to participants, registration of 
participants, as well as providing a medal or certificate of completion to participants.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Walk-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       Walk-athons are extremely popular for several reasons. First of all, walking is something everyone does naturally every single day, so it is an easy activity for anyone to 
participate in. A lot of planning is required as routes need to be planned and permits are required. Often the route will be handicap friendly, therefore those who are in wheelchairs 
can participate as well. Secondly, they are excellent for the entire family to get involved; parents, children, grandparents, etc. The Walk-a-thon is a time tested method 
to raise significant sums of money. Participants can walk together in teams, and fundraise together using a team fundraising page on the event website, making it a social 
event for a great cause. Volunteers are needed to direct participants and supply food and water. Security will be needed if large groups of participants will be crossing busy 
roads. Infirmaries may also be needed too for people who may develop blisters or pain if the walk is long.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Dog-Walk-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       This is another version of the walk-a-thon, where participants walk with a dog. It is a great way to distinguish your event from all of the others. There are many 
walk-a-thons but very few that involve dogs. Dog enthusiasts love these sort of events and will be inclined to participate. Routes will need to be established, and 
volunteers need to direct and supply water and snacks to participants and their dogs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Bike-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       Another very popular event is the bike-a-thon. This type of event can raise very large sums of money for your organization or cause. Bike-a-thons can range from small 
family events that take place over a few blocks to larger corporate based and competitive type events. Some Bike-a-thons even take place over multiple days completing 
a route between cities. This type of event requires a lot of planning. Routes and permits are required. Security and safety is also a primary concern. Volunteers are needed for 
the event to run smoothly. Safety is a primary concern. If the event is to occur for more than one day, a lot more planning is needed to incorporate sleeping and meal arrangements 
for participants. Bikers can register online and fundraise alone or in a teams. You can also hold an indoor bike-a-thon on stationary bikes at a local gym.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Swim-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       A Swim-a-thon is another excellent type of fundraiser. It will appeal to many participants, and requires a lot less planning in comparison to a walk-a-thon or bike-a-thon. 
Swim-a thons can be held in indoor or outdoor swimming pools or even in lakes. If held in an indoor facility, Swim-a-thons are not dependent on good weather and can 
be held at any time of the year. Safety is a primary concern. A Swim-a-thon requires specialized monitoring by qualified lifeguards, especially when children are participating. The 
event can be easily promoted in pool clubs or facilities to attract groups of people who would enjoy this type of event. The event can include a race where the winning individual or 
team can win a medal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Trike-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       Very popular for daycare centers in religious institutions, a trike a thon can have children and actual tricycles and adults with actual bikes. It can be done indoors in a gymnasium so 
it is not weather dependant. You need to think about refreshments, registration at the event, bikes, trikes, and where you will hold the event. It can be inexpensive to put 
on and you will raise the most money of all participants get their own fundraising page.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Bowl-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       There are several key advantages to organizing a bowl-a-thon. It's relatively easy to organize and to recruit participants, it's not weather dependant, and the entire 
event is contained in one place. Most bowling alleys have areas to purchase food and beverages, so you do not have to worry about supplying food to participants. Winning 
teams can win a prize.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Dance-a-thon
       </b>
       <br/>
       Dance-a-thon's are a great and fun way to raise money. The event can be held indoors or outdoors but does require a lot of space. This event is not hard to organize as all will take 
place in one location. A gymnasium is probably the best option of where to hold the event. Different genre dance instructors can come teach participants hip hop,

involve much planning. Volunteers are needed however to collect donated items. MyEvent.com can help organize drives and build awareness about them through their social 
media capabilities. Certain organizations have collection bags where people place what they are donating inside, and the organization comes and picks it up from your 
home. Many organizations also have collection boxes where people can go and drop off goods they are donating. Drives can collect goods for more than one 
organization or cause. The main challenge faced when organizing a drive is building awareness about the event, cause, and location of drop off boxes.

       Be the first one in your community to have a fundraising egg drop. You may have seen a version of this on the David Letterman show. Participants are working in teams and are 
given the same materials to construct a container that will protect the egg as much as possible. The egg is dropped in the receptacle from a window or the top of a building (make 
sure someone is watching that it is all clear below so you don't hurt anyone or get egg on their face or your : ). You can have many rounds and eliminate teams whose eggs 
crack. Keep on moving to a higher floor every round to make it tougher. You can also reduce the amount of time to make the container to make it tougher as well. This is a very 
inexpensive and fun event to have. It is unique and participants are guaranteed to have a blast. You need to consider refreshments, materials, and where you will do the 
event. Add a personal fundraising component for each participant to get the most reach.
