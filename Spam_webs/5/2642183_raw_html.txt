          Ancient History is one of my favorite research topics. I not only love the crazy possibilities for entertainment value, but also, approaching it with an open mind, I get an immense educational value from videos such as this next one.

          Its called
          <strong>
           The Mystery of the Carpathian Sphinx and the Origins of Man
          </strong>
          , and Im trilled to make this post about it. I watched it for the first time only a short time ago, and it covered many ideas I have felt but not heard much said about, and others that were totally new.

          Shanidar 1 Skull 
          <strong>
           62,000 BC
          </strong>
          What he discovered was
          <strong>
           a burial with flowers
          </strong>
          . He discovered the skeletons of handicapped and old people, so it meant that the Neanderthal had to
          <strong>
           take care of their sick and their old

          It was clearly a cult that believed in immortality, that there was something beyond physical death, that there was something beyond the material existence, there was something that we might call a soul that would continue, that would survive. This is actually not a belief that the ancient Greeks for instance had, but it seems to be a belief that the Neanderthals had.

          The Greek historian Plato believed that there had be many great civilizations, that had disappeared in a variety of catastrophes. Today, humanity has forgotten the past. In the human unconscious, there is an extremely powerful force, that acts on an individual, keeping him from seeing with clarity the obvious symptoms of his next death. Only in the last moments are the eyes of the soul opened and man understands his situation and accepts it. The landslide of all the empires, and all the human institutions, is evident as soon as one studies the past.

          Why do we believe in a progress without end? Everything dies around us. High atop a vast plateau in the Carpathian Mountains of old Europe, there is an unknown, enigmatic sculptor that strikingly resembles the Great Sphinx of Egypt. For that reason it was named the Carpathian Sphinx. Could there be a link between the Carpathian Sphinx and the Great Sphinx of Egypt? Could the Carpathian Sphinx be the result of a lost civilization?

          While living in Boston I go and I check all the library sources I can find. Im convinced by what I find, I decide to leave the United States and I return to Eastern Europe to the homeland I left 15 years before. The Sphinx was calling me to unravel its hidden story. I had to solve the mystery. Could the Carpathian Mountains and the Sphinx have a central, yet forgotten role in the history of the world?

          Im probably best known in certain circles for my work on the Sphinx, Im only going to mention it very briefly because I feel like I have to, because in many ways it does set the stage for what were heard about at this conference, conference on Precession, Ancient Knowledge and really pushing things way back and this work that goes back almost 2 decades now for myself, personally, really set the stage for much of what has come later, and Im not claiming any credit here, Im giving credit to the Sphinx. Its also changed my life. Sometimes I think, usually I think for the better. Sometimes I wonder what I got myself into. So, I really started out the Sphinx work when I was very young. This is me, about 20 years ago, and what it really indicated doing, at least for some people, and this was part of the controversy, part of why where here now, talking about, you know, if you push the date of the Sphinx back, does it mean that we have to view history differently? Do we have to rewrite history?

          The head was re-carved into the human form that it takes now, parts of the Sphinx itself if you look at it to this day, its been heavily repaired. Some of those repairs go back 4000 and more years, because it was a much more ancient statue, thousands of years earlier. Things were happening in Egypt in a much earlier period then conventional Archeologists, then conventional historians, have ever admitted or suspected.

          Daniel Ruzo a Peruvian Archeologist and protohistorian from Peru has come to believe that there once had been a great world wide civilization that had been destroyed in a cataclysm. This civilization left marks all over the world, in all the continents. Ruzo found proof in England, in such monuments as Stone Henge, in France in Fontainebleau. Wherever he looked, he found proof. He became aware that this civilization was especially a mountain civilization, that lived on the high peak of the mountains, in all the continents. In 1954, Ruzo discovered Markawasi, a small plateau high atop mountains Andes in Peru. Markawasi up to this date remains a mystery. There are faces here of Women. He called this one the monument to Humanity. Ruzo believed that the monument to Humanity was one of the most important sculptures ever made.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 1968, Ruzo came to the Carpathian Mountains, in Romania. Here Ruzo, found the proof that he was searching for. Everywhere he looked on the Bucegi Massif in the Carpathian Mountains, he found proof of a very ancient culture. He believed here, was the door to the treasure of a lost people. Ruzo believed that the treasure is not a material one, but a spiritual treasure. Ruzo investigated the area around the Carpathian Sphinx and he found tantalizing proof of this lost civilization here as well.

          Ruzo concluded that the Carpathian Sphinx, just as the monument to Humanity in Markawasi was an important legacy of a lost people. When he returned to Peru, Ruzo published a book called, The Fantastic History of a Discovery, and in that book he wrote about the trip to Romania. He dedicated a chapter to what he saw in the Carpathian Mountains. And he said, the Romanian Carpathian Mountains were at the center of the oldest European civilization known today. His conclusions were made after he saw the Carpathian Sphinx.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ruzo died in 1991, before he was able to find this world-wide vanished civilization, but his work paved the road for later research. Ruzo was confident that he was right, and that one day, someone, will clarify the mystery, and fill the empty question marks. Who were these vanished people, that left their imprints in these monuments?

          Here we are in front of an original sculpture, known all over the world, it has not been reproduced in historical times. Being so used to a 3 dimensional landscape, starting in Sumerian times, we have failed until today to see these sculptures considered made by nature.

          The strangest apparition on the plateau is the Sphinx. A huge rock, with an enigmatic profile, around which a protohistorical legend had been formed. The legend says that the Sphinx is a statue made in times long forgotten, by the people of a lost civilization.

          From a distance, it looks very abrupt, uninviting, with steep rocky areas that are very hard to climb. But the reality of the Mountain is actually something different.

          Interestingly, once you get up there you get the unexpected. It opens up into a huge plateau.

         <p>
          The Sphinx is at a central point on the plateau. Going south directly from the Sphinx there is a group of enigmatic rocks, called the peaks of longing. From here, in direct line to the North, one can see the Sphinx and then the highest peak, called (inaudible) the peak of the human being.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Robert M. Schoch:
         </h4>
         <p>
          Something thats very interesting looking at the Sphinx in Romania, looking at the plateau, looking at the surrounding area, is you have these, at high elevation, you have these incredible structures. They can be seen from a very great distance, they certainly seem like markers or sign posts, or something that might attract ancient peoples and I think this is something we have to take very seriously.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Narrator:
         </h4>
         <p>
          Many of the rocks on the plateau have feminine names. This one is called the Big Old Lady Rock. These ones are the old ladies of Cocora Mountain. This is the Mountain of the Old Lady. The (inaudible) valley hides the mountain called the Goddesses Mountain.
         </p>
         <p>
          The highest peak in Bucegi, facing the North direction, the Peak of the Human Being. This mountain is called the Origin or the Beginning Mountain. The main river flowing down the valley below the Goddesses Mountain was called an (inaudible) which means heavenly one. So the question is, why are all these womens names in these mountains? And the sacred names, such as the Mountain of the Goddesses, and the Mountain called Human Being? Could there have been here a religious Matriarchal society at one point in time? Could there have been a very ancient feminine worship?
         </p>
         <h4>
          Daniel Ruzos Words:
         </h4>
         <p>
          The origin of these names must be discovered, as the myths, as well the sculptures are before the time of the flood. The Sphinxs multiple profiles, best seen in the changing light. Where do the orbits of the Sphinx point to? Why are there all these figures, especially the ones looking West towards the setting sun. The profile that resembles the Egyptian Sphinx, is looking North. The profile that resembles an (inaudible) face is looking West. Why does one profile look towards the North, and another towards the West? One to the Northern Sky and the other one, towards the setting Sun, why? And where is the door to the treasure? Who is this bearded God, will I ever find out?
         </p>
         <p>
          The enigmatic faces are only seen from certain points of view. They are best seen with the changing light, the shadows of the Moon and the Sun. Will the Sun point to a secret direction? Ruzo believed these monuments point to the sacred treasure found in caves. And what is the mystery of the gigantic rock, resembling very much a podium or stage? Could this place have been used for some type of performance? For some rituals of a vanished humanity?
         </p>
         <p>
          A vast crowd could have been in the valley looking up at somebody performing, singing or dancing on the top. Could this be the door to the treasure? Could this relate back to the Sphinx? To the caverns that Daniel Ruzo was talking about? Could the spiritual treasure Daniel was talking about be found in these caves.
         </p>
         <p>
          This cave is on the mountain called Goddesses Mountain. Could there be any traces here, that would point to a lost civilization?
         </p>
         <p>
          Daniel Ruzo considered that only an expert could find this door.
         </p>
         <p>
          Where do I need to look? To find the answers. Could this be an ancient religious center as Daniel Ruzo had concluded? Could there be a spiritual treasure here?

          The Neanderthals lived in Europe, during the ice age for at least 100,000 years. Neanderthals range included all of Europe and parts of Asia, the Middle East and

          . During the time of the Neanderthals, in the Carpathian Mountains, there was a high population of cave bears. One of the biggest populations in Europe. There is still a puzzling mystery why Neanderthals went extinct but a number of possible scenarios have been proposed by scientists. Ranging from natural disasters, massive earth quakes and catastrophic volcanic eruptions in Europe, but also human diseases. It is unclear if the Cro-Magnon massively eliminated Neanderthal on purpose, or if they were already doomed. Contrary to popular belief, many Neanderthal populations in Europe had light skin, green eyes and red hair.

          Typically, people had the concept of Neanderthals as being dark, brutish, ape like, if you would, and the Cro-Magnons, our ancestors, were the light skinned, fair-hared individuals. It may be totally opposite. That, in fact the early archaic Homo Sapiens were much darker than the Neanderthals that they came in contact with in Europe. Gooch predicted this long ago.

          Neanderthals were much stronger than modern humans. The body type of a Neanderthal can easily be compared to that of a modern wrestler or body builder. They were not delicate, nor what we would consider beautiful, but surprisingly Neanderthals were highly emotional and a very sensitive bunch. There is strong evidence from their anatomy, suggesting they had a very well developed vocal apparatus, powerful voices, perfect pitch and a more sensitive inner ear than the one of the modern human.

          SteveMithen an archeologist from the UK, think Neanderthals were the most musically developed human species that ever lived. They were musically inclined, amazing singers, and they were great performers.

          The Neanderthals were a nocturnal species and they worshiped the Moon. They came out at night and performed ceremonies for the Moon Goddess, especially at full Moon or new Moon. Anatomical evidence for a nocturnal lifestyle rests on the Neanderthals very large round eye sockets and very large ear purgers. Large eyes in particular are the special hallmark of a nocturnal creature. The Neanderthals learned how to not fear the darkness, and in the process they fell in love with the nights sky. The Neanderthals worshiped the Northern Sky, they considered that the still center of the heavens was in the North. They worshiped the Northern Constellations, the constellation of the Little Bear and the Big Bear. According to Stan Gooch the cave bear ritual of the neanderthals is the oldest ritual in the world performed by a human species.

          The Neanderthal may have been far more intelligent than we recognize. Neanderthal man appeared to know far more about the stars for example, than one would suppose, I mean my general picture of Neanderthal is obviously of a shampy ape and Stan argued that in fact, he knew an enormous amount about the heavens, and also about procession of the equinoxes and about all kinds of other things.

          Symbolic behavior was central to the Neanderthal culture. Neanderthals made advanced stone tools, cooked their meals and ate vegetables. They wore jewelry and body painting, had their own language system, and live in complex social groups. They collected and preserved crystals and minerals, and probably made figurines. In Stan Goochs view, Neanderthals culturally advanced people. Highly civilized in spirit with a deep sense of religion and practiced herbal medicine.

          He was interested in things like brain structure, he pointed out rightfully that Neanderthals on average had larger brains than modern humans, but these larger brains were differently arranged, differentlyproportioned than our modern humans, so for instance a very important point of Gooch, one that he makes over and over in his writings and books, is that Neanderthal brains had larger cerebellums, the brain of humans, be it Neanderthal or modern humans is composed of a cerebrum and a cerebellum, the cerebellum is sometimes referred to as the smaller brain, the lesser brain, its essentially, one could argue, a separate brain, housed inside and underneath,anatomically the rest of the brain. Gooch points out that the cerebellum was larger in Neanderthals. He attributes and I believe rightfully so, based on clinical evidence that the cerebellum is really the seat of many mental abilities, many mental processes, that we to this day have a very poor understanding of, so for instance dreams may originate primarily in the cerebellum, certain types of artistic impulses, religious impulses, impulses of the sacred, certain, we could call loosely philosophical, and psychical impulses.

          When Neanderthal andCro-Magnon interbred, Stan Gooch believes, each side made a unique contribution, at one level this was a cultural cross fertilization, but at a deeper level it was a genetic encounter. Neanderthal contributed our religious genes, whileCro-Magnon contributed our scientific endowment. A project to sequence the

          You have these two cultures meeting, very different world views, essentially a duality, the scientific on the one hand, the religious on the other hand. I can imagine the Cro-Magnons studying the Neanderthal, perhaps surreptitiously at first, trying to understand, well what are these weird people doing? What is all this about? What are these strange rituals and practices, these ceremonies, this dancing, this singing that they were observing. What is this all about? Cro-Magnons could not necessarily understand what was going on, they tried to figure out what was going on, what was very alien to them.

          Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal did not interbreed peacefully, in my opinion. Basically it wasCro-Magnon raping Neanderthal women, thats how we arose and thats why it says in the Old Testament, When the Sons of God came into the Daughters of Men, these were the Mighty Men of Old. Their offspring were the Mighty Men of Old. Sons of God, Cro-Magnon, male, daughters of men, a her, female, Neanderthal. It wasCro-Magnon raping Neanderthal women, in my opinion which produced us.

          Our culture, our religious impulses, many of our institutions, societal institutions are really a combinations of Neanderthal institutions, our religious aspects if you want to call it that, and Cro-Magnons. That the Cro-Magnons really adopted, or inherited, or actually took over many Neanderthal concepts, then many Neanderthal mental innovations. For instance maybe symbolism, religious ceremonies, many of what in a most deep seated way make up our culture, make up our identity as we see it today.

          A lot of our culture and our beliefs, and our disbeliefs, come from Neanderthal, so weve incorporated much of the Neanderthal material into our lives. Now, in particular, picking on this in particular, I maintain that the story of Christ, and the resurrection, all of it, is simply a distorted version of the ancient Moon religion. Crucified on the Cross, the Cross is the symbol of the Moon in all pre-Christian cultures world-wide. Hes crucified on Friday, which is Friars Day, shes the Moon Goddess, he resurrected on Monday, which is Moon Day. Hes resurrected 3 days later, then he dies, now 3 is important for several reasons in the Moon culture. One is the Moon has three colors, white, red and black. So the Moon has three colors, and whats more important that that? Oh yeah, the other thing of course is that Earth, Moon and Sun are considered to be Mother, Father, Child. The Earth is the Child, the Daughter that, the Daughter of the Sun and the Moon. That was part of the Moon religion, so the three for several reasons. Christ is said to be born in the 25th of December, and thats three days, did you say three, three days after the shortest day. When the Sun is reborn every year, after the Moon sacrifices him on the shortest day, she sacrifices him and then resurrects him, so that life can continue.

          Could the Story of Jesus Christ be based on a far older story of Neanderthal rituals? Could our most cherished religious beliefs originate with the Neanderthal? Such as the concepts we have of immortality and resurrection? Could the Bible be an actual historical source that has preserved some of the Neanderthal wisdom, preserving it for us in a veiled form?

           Shanidar, the First Flower People
          </a>
          . In the cave of Shanidar, Solecki discovered 9 Neanderthal skeletons, the most ever found in one cave. During the excavations that took many years to uncover, Solecki discovered something extraordinary that change completely the perception of Neanderthal up to that point. This was 1971. What he discovered was a burial with flowers. The Neanderthals had buried their dead with seasonal flowers. That also had medicinal purposes. This was quite shocking to discover. The compassion of these people, and the fact that they believe in an afterlife. The flowers found in the Shanidar Cave are found in Bucegi. It was a spring burial with flowers that were white, violet and yellow.
         </p>
         <p>
          In his excavations, Solecki discovered other thing that changed our perception of Neanderthal. He discovered the skeletons of handicapped and old people, so it meant that the Neanderthal had to take care of their sick and their old. Isnt that such a human touch? Solecki called the Neanderthals, people with such good characters, we should be proud to have them as our ancestors. This is a far cry from the view of Neanderthal held for most of this century, that they were a brutal subspecies of humans. In light of recent evidence, Neanderthal emerges shockingly close to a modern human, a sensitive, highly intelligent creature, with a well developed culture and a well developed sense of self. Like any good scientific theory, Goochs ideas are subject to testing and further observation.

          Two hours walking distance from the Sphinx, there is a cave called The Bear Cave, because a lot of cave bear remains have been found here as well as Neanderthal tools and two Neanderthal hearths.

This face is looking towards the West, and were hear in the evening and the Sun is setting. Look how the Sun is lined up.

         <p>
          Direct line to the eye. This Neanderthal type face is looking towards the West, it looking towards the setting Sun, now its been speculated, that Neanderthals were a more nocturnal species, if thats the case, what Sun would they be interested in, the setting Sun, the Sun that sets as they come out for their nocturnal activities, their ceremonies, their rituals, so they would not be looking towards the East as many modern cultures do, but towards the West, the setting Sun , which would be significant and important to them because essentially that would start their day, that would start their ceremonies, and here we have a Neanderthal like face looking towards the setting Sun.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yeah looking at this face, as a geologist, looking at the different types of rock, youve got several different layers of rock. Youve got more fine sandstone, youve got conglomerates, youve got rocks that are set within the rock thats all natural. Like these pink rocks and these darker blackish rocks, and then you have what looks like a little hat on top of it, which is a slightly different rock a different lithology again. So youve got very complex interplay of different rock types, and thats all natural. Then, you have them shaped into this face, this profile, and thats why I start to wonder. Is that totally natural erosional features, or is there the possibility, that it started to look like a face, because of natural erosional features, is it possible that maybe people came, they pecked away at it, they modified it a little bit, to look more like a face. We know from other places that does happen. Now, when Ive walked around this, looked at it closely, its so badly eroded that its, I would say, virtually impossible to tell, at this point, if theres any kind of artificiality to it. There could have been, I cant say for certain, but I think more importantly, in a way, it doesnt matter cause youve got this profile, youve got this structure. Its clearly recognizable as a face, as a human profile. When you walk around to the other side, youve got another clearly recognizable profile, theyre oriented in important directions, this one toward the North, the other face, that looks more Neanderthal, toward the West. Thats significant in both cases, so whether theyre natural, or whether theyre artificial, or some combination of both, I can see that they were incredibly important. They would have attracted attention in ancient times, just as they do now. Many sacred sites around the world are natural, and theyre maybe even considered more sacred because they are natural, theyre from nature, theyre from the Gods.

          So, I see this as a huge head, but really only the upper portion of the head, what I call the emerging head, and if you look at it, this to me looks like a nose. So, youve got a nose starting here, huge nose. Youve got an eye socket here, and then above the eye socket the brow ridge, and then a low forehead, and whats interesting is this forehead is not like a modern forehead. Its much lower, the whole skull, the whole head is pulled back, elongated toward the back portion, which to me says, this is a Neanderthal head.

          Yeah, its like its being born from the bedrock and so, not only do you have this face, this emerging head, which I think it very recognizable. Neanderthals would have recognized it, but you also have, look what were standing on. Sort of this staging area, right in front of it, which I think could have been used for ritual purposes, ceremonies, initiations. It would make a perfect place. Its like a, I dont want to call it an alter, but a stage, where things could take place, with the backdrop of the head. Here on this area, on the front of the emerging head, where Ive suggested that ceremonies and rituals may have been taking place, look what we have. What this is, is sort of a scooped out area.

         <p>
          Yeah, its quite deep, yeah its just sentiments, thats collected in modern times. What I think we have here is really a depression or a basin area, that would have been perfect for ritualistic purposes, for different ceremonial purposes, it may have started out as a natural depression, but I believe it was probably enhanced by people rubbing it, scratching it. You see in more recent ancient sites, from only a few thousand years ago, say at temple complexes in Egypt, in Turkey, places where people will rub the rock, theyll scrape it. It makes depressions, their trying to get the sacredness, the power from that scared site, this may have been formed initially the same way. Formed this depression, this now serves for ceremonial purposes.

          Of generations potentially, if theyre doing it by hand and rubbing it or scraping it, scraping away at it. But what you have it, youve got this depression, this basin that could be used for any number of purposes. Maybe it was filled with water and used for some kind of cleansing ritual. Maybe it was used for some kind of sanctified or holy water, we still have those concepts today. Either cleansing rituals as you go into a sacred place or holy water that brings the power of the scared site, and lets you ingest it or maybe sprinkle it on yourself. Baptism we still use water, from a basin, from a depression. Maybe it was used to collect some kind of sacrifice for the Gods, maybe it was filled with liquid, maybe some kind of drink, maybe it was used to collect blood, if there were sacrifices of animals.
         </p>
         <p>
          We saw a little bit higher that basin area, that may have been used for ceremonial purposes, to me this is very similar. This is not a basin, possibility it was at one point, if this is eroded back, in more recent times. You can see theres some breakage there, but what looks like an area that eroded out you can put you hand

          At least back to there, and what it looks to me like, is a place where people may have been scraping at it, removing material. Its a slightly different rock here in the general matrix. It would have attracted attention, you see its sort of an orangish, reddish, but like you see at other sacred sites, of more recent origin, it may have been a place where people scratched it to try to get a little bit of powder, a little bit um, they essentially the power the sacred power of this spot.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another feature that is on the plateau that really struck me, is what we could call the bearded head, the bearded mans head. Its a huge structure, very powerful, very moving in my mind, and I suspect that whether its natural, or artificial, or some combination of both, this is something that may have survived from a very long time ago, geologically and may have moved people and been recognized by people, specifically Neanderthals, before the end of the last ice age. That they would have recognized this as looking like a face, as a bearded face, just like we do now. It almost looks to me like what some people image of God is. You know a Judeo-Christian bearded male figure. Interesting that you find it up in the Mountains, when youre approaching, it seems to be, in my mind the place of the scared ritualistic setting
         </p>
         <p>
          Im told that the name thats been given to it is the Mechid, thats a name that goes back, we dont know exactly how long, but its called the Mechid, loosely translates as the Church and this suggests right away that theres something special about this area.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="The Mechid" src="http://truthseekermedia.com/pictures/carpathian-mountains.jpg"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          What is the Mechid? Its this incredible limestone formation, huge formation, incredibly symmetrical, and it appears to me, as if it were a stage or a podium, but of enormous scale. A scale I think of Giants, its a huge scale and its symmetrically arranged, it itself is symmetrical and it sits in a little valley area, that forms in my mind a natural amphitheater. This I cant help but to think would form a perfect stage for ceremonies, for ritual practices, for initiation, for other types of sacred and religious practices.
         </p>
         <p>
          In fact, maybe at night it would be even more dramatic if there were huge bonfires on the Mechid, if various trees like evergreen trees were thrown on to bonfires, then sparked up like fireworks, if there was drumming, if there was singing, music, voices.
         </p>
         <p>
          So, I think this could be a very powerful setting for ceremonial purposes. All the pieces, in my mind come together here to suggest that this is a central location.
         </p>
         <p>
          The river the ancient name for the river, which respectively originates at the Mechid, is sometimes interpreted or translated as Divine River or the Heavenly River, so here we have more allusions to the Divine, to the sacred, but theres still more. On one side of the Valley, the rock formations, the rock peak, is referred to as the Origin Peak, or the Beginning Peak, this suggests to me a religious connotation of the origins of the Universe, the Cosmos, of people. How did things originate, sort of in a Judo-Christian sense, a Genesis. How did life itself, and the Universe, the Cosmos originate. On the other side of the Valley, the formations are known as the Goddesses, reference to Divinity, especially if were talking about Neanderthals. They put a lot of emphasis on Women and Goddesses, so weve got the Goddesses, the Origins, the Mechid, weve got the Heavenly or Divine River and then if we keep going further North, beyond the Mechid, to the highest peak, we have the Peak of the Human Being. Which suggests to me the origins of life, the origins of of humanity. Processions would be carried on, going up the river valley, from the South, up toward the Mechid, as you ascend up the river valley, toward the plateau, you find the Mechid as a very central location. Theres nothing else like this in the vicinity, theres nothing else like this in the area, theres nothing like this potentially in all of Europe. So, perhaps this was a focal point a gathering place for ancient Neanderthal people from a very broad geographic region.
         </p>
         <p>
          I could see this very much as a gathering place for sacred rituals, for ceremonies. In fact, as Ive looked at the maps, as Ive looked at the geology and the topography, the geography of this region, you dont have anything like this anywhere else. You dont have a place thats at high altitude, where from below it looks like huge mountain peaks. In fact, were in the Carpathian Mountains, but then when you get up to the top, its like a fortress and it opens up into this plateau.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Narrator:

         <h4>
          Robert M. Schoch:
         </h4>
         <p>
          Structures like this  here it is so this would be a gathering point, I see it very much as a gathering point, a ceremonial point, and I wonder as I think about how wide-spread the populations were that would gather here periodically, because theres no other area thats as well suited as this, for I believe, hundreds of kilometers. So, were talking Neanderthal culture and consistent rituals over a large geographic area, consistent beliefs, shared beliefs, shared religious ceremonies. Periodically they would gather to exchange stories, to participate in ceremonies that would bond different communities together. I think this is the perfect spot for that.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know that theres a strong Neanderthal presence here. We have a number of caves, caves that occur along the river valley, as you ascend up towards the Mechid and up towards the plateau. These caves, to this day, preserve evidence of Neanderthal presence, evidence of Neanderthal rituals.

          People could have been coming from many, even hundreds of kilometers or more away, gathering at certain times. Maybe this was something that happened every few years, maybe it was even major ceremonies that occurred once in a generation, and it was a pilgrimage. We can very much imagine, and I think its more than just imagination. We can reconstruct, start to reconstruct, how such pilgrimages occurred, and what practices would have been carried out along the way. Maybe initiations were carried out along these, along the passage. Getting up to the plateau.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are really the combination in many ways, of both Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons and one question is, can we successfully integrate these two aspects. Arguably, Neanderthals were much closer to nature, they understood how they fit into nature much better than Cro-Magnons.

          And I could see them doing things like that for dramatic effect and at certain times. You know during a ceremony. I bet a lot of the hearths and the fire remains that are found, had nothing do to with warmth. It was probably ritualistic, I mean they didnt need heat. They were used to the climate.

You know because fires get really hot like that and if youre used to the natural climate and you know relatively cold conditions, then thats what is normal for you. You wouldnt want to be building these huge fires, just to get really hot and go back out again into the really cold.

          Im thinking that they were bringing crystals or special stones I think to they probably take them out, they use them more, Im even thinking that if they were using some kind of crystals or whatnot they might bring them in, sort of sanctify them, if I could put it that way. Then they would take them with them, so its not like we would expect them to leave their valuables just laying about for us to find later, you know.

          Yeah, not like an organized religion, but a real deep feeling of sanctity and spirituality I would say.
         </p>
         <p>
          You go into a cathedral in many cases, one that not, thats not illuminated by modern lighting, but the more traditional way, with very subdued lighting, essentially in my mind youre going to an artificial cave. I think that that many of the churches and cathedrals we see now, from medieval orrenaissance times for instance, are actually a legacy, a legacy of the cave. The cave being used as a ritualistic site, some of these legacies may go back tens of thousands of years.
         </p>
         <p>
          I suspect for Neanderthal culture, for Neanderthal civilization, maybe the single most important thing, the most central point, was their religion. What is now called religion, Im not sure they would have used that term, because it may have been so all encompassing for them, that it was well beyond what we think of religion now in a modern, Western sense, but the religiosity, the mental world that they developed and well call it religious/magical sense, and they may have been incredibly sophisticated, incredibly developed, I think possibly well beyond where we are today. The Cro-Magnons , I would speculate, tried to put it into simplistic terms, well whats going on with these other people, these Neanderthals. Who are they? We can really understand whats going on, so we try to categorize it in simple terms, sometimes its black, sometimes its white. Sometimes theyre doing good things, sometimes theyre doing bad things, and our modern concept of things like a Good God, a Bad Devil, Angles verses Satan, may have come from a simplistic Cro-Magnon understanding of much more subtle, much more nuanced, Neanderthal rituals and religion. I suspect that for Neanderthals, it wasnt a simple category of Good on one side, and Bad on the other side, or what we would call God and Devil. It may have been much more nuanced. It may have seemed that you need both aspects, I even think of ancient religions in a classical sense, for instance ancient Egyptians. They did not make the same distinction between good and bad as modern society often does. They realized that for the working of the Cosmos, the Universe, in a general sense, as they saw it. There had to be both good and bad, there had to be both sides, what we would call good and bad. They were just two ends of a continuous spectrum, and I suspect that Neanderthals saw a lot of grey area also.

          Stan Gooch:

          What we really have to do, is to take our duel aspects, our Cro-Magnon aspects, our Neanderthal aspects and combine them, so that neither overpowers the other, hit a balance between them and if we can do that successfully, we may in fact, create something that rises above either.

          And so you have this dichotomy between religion and intuition with Neanderthals, and reason and logic with Cro-Magnons, and Stan Gooch, says that it was sort of monumental when the two met. Also, you had two different world views coming together, neither really understood the other, so the Neanderthal didnt really understand these new Cro-Magnons that were invading their territory. TheCro-Magnons didnt really understand what the Neanderthals were doing with all these weird rituals, and ceremonies, and dancing and singing. That was foreign to them, they tried to figure it out, what they called magic.

          Its a world in itself. The ritual cave, sometimes imitates the night sky. In other words, it is a mago mandi, a Universe in miniature. Living in a cave does not necessarily imply going down among the shades, it can as well imply living in a different world, a world thats vaster, more complex, because it incorporates various modes of existence and hence is full of riches, and countless virtualities.

          They and other ancient, you know certain other ancient peoples, but well focus on Neanderthals for now, are much more sophisticated, in ways that we dont even have a good language to describe. I mean you have traditions around the world, of a Golden Age, which I think is not referring to a materialistic Golden Age.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our civilization has progressed one way, materialistically, and that type of sophistication weve plummeted. To judge a culture like the Neanderthals by the scanty remains, the physical remains, its, its sort of insane.

          Heres a setting where, effectively in the mythology, in the religious beliefs, humans may have originated. Maybe this was the most important, the most sacred, the most central location for Neanderthal populations as whole.

         <p>
          Its as if youre approaching an incredible cathedral, an incredibly holy spot and as you approach it, you come to various points where you prepare yourself for the ultimate adventure, the ultimate religious experience at the highest peaks. So, this entire complex, which, in many ways is symbolized by the Carpathian Sphinx is a huge religious, ceremonial,ritualistic complex that must have been incredibly important to the Neanderthal people for generations and generations, probably thousands and thousands of generations, over tens of thousands of years.

          Really important to me to come here and experience first hand the caves, to experience first hand the plateau, to experience first hand the Carpathian Sphinx. To me in fact, in some ways we can think of the Carpathian Sphinx as being a symbol for a lost world, literally a lost people, a lost culture, the mountain is a lost cathedral and the Carpathian Sphinx is the lost alter.
