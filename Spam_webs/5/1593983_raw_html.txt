    The Shakti  of Aksobhya

  <blockquote>

    <hr/>

   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    The musicality of being is the silence which holds all knowledge
    <br/>
    It is the quiet pool at twilight, free of ripples and full with the moon's reflection
    <br/>
    It is the breathing of a quiet forest, whose creatures are at rest
    <br/>
    It is the water of an underground river, which flows towards the sunlight
    <br/>
    It is the perfect white vase, empty yet full
   </p>
   <p>
    Life reflects the music of being when it has no passion or anxiety
    <br/>
    When the deep blue of midnight has spread over all the land
    <br/>
    When there is joyful hope, when the light of wisdom is soon to dawn
    <br/>
    When the stillness is perceived within all movement
    <br/>
    When the Soul is awakened
   </p>
   <p>
    The worshiper of silence and purity is clean, free and at rest
    <br/>
    He sees the air within the bubbles of form
    <br/>
    He hears the quiet within the loudest music
    <br/>
    There are no conflicts within him, nor desires nor illusions
    <br/>
    His mind is spontaneous, yet composed
    <br/>
    He bows neither to idols nor demons nor  gods
    <br/>
    His heart is free of waves
   </p>
   <p>
    I am the mediator of purity, the essence of salvation
    <br/>
    I am the ladder which is climbed to the ultimate Goal
    <br/>
    I quiet restless minds, and open up cloudy emotions to moonlight
    <br/>
    I clear the jungle path of brambles, that the true seeker may proceed unhindered
   </p>
   <p>
    Silence holds the keys to all doors, the answer to all riddles
    <br/>
    The music that is heard is but a symbol, a manifestation, a stain upon the clear sky
    <br/>
    Melodies and notes are but illusion, reflections upon reflections, which bind the pilgrim and bind the heart
    <br/>
    Silence destroys all barriers, destroys all forms, brings the blind to see again
   </p>
   <p>
    My lord is Aksobya, the One
    <br/>
    Unique, alone, unchanging in a universe full of change
    <br/>
    He is silent, invisible, there is no form to bind him
    <br/>
    He brings all beings to freedom unending
    <br/>
    He bursts the chains of existence, freeing all from identity
    <br/>
    He sits quietly, and brings the raving masses to peace.
   </p>
