         One of the most exciting and empowering business ventures an entrepreneur can undertake is starting their own freelance consulting business. Not only can a freelance business be a very lucrative business endeavor, but also in addition, it provides a number of other priceless benefits for the freelancing professional, such as freedom, autonomy, ownership, and increased professional and personal fulfillment in ones work. But starting a freelance consulting business isnt for everyone and it isnt easy by any means.

         From defining goals, creating infrastructure, setting rates, managing client expectations, marketing the business, and delivering consistent value, among other things, the issues that new freelance consultants face as they build their business can really be truly challenging.
        </p>
        <p>

To do that, we asked 42 freelancing professionals and business experts the following question:

          The biggest mistake that people new to freelancing make is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Not specializing.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are freelancers for everything that theres a job for. Trying to compete for every job going simply makes you look like a Jack of all trades, master of none.
        </p>
        <p>
         Far too many freelancers try to be everything to everyone when in reality, specializing in the area that youre strongest in makes you a large fish in a small pond. When youve reached this status, you can start to grow into larger areas and even hire in house staff to help. Your feedback and reviews in your chosen specialization will make you super relevant to employers looking for that skill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Employers are looking for someone who knows their subject area inside out, not someone who can do everything including what the employer wants. If I have a problem with my car windows, Im going to want a car window specialist, not a local car dealer to fix my problem. If I have a heart problem, I want a heart specialist and not a GP working on my ticker. Word of mouth and repeat business is going to be the mainstay for a new freelancer. Making sure youre the go to freelancer for a single core competency is the fastest way to grow.

         Not setting an appropriate pay rate.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I started out as a freelance writer and editor, I set an hourly rate that was equal to one of my competitors. Turned out it was way too low. Companies didnt bat an eyelash about paying it. Over a couple of years, I raised my rate 50 percent for new clients, but had a tough time raising it for existing ones.

          The number one mistake people new to freelance consulting make when starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Lack of confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
         I find that some freelancers who are new to the business arent confident enough about their skills and what they have to offer. And as a result, they give up too soon
        </p>
        <p>
         When I first started my business nd people asked me are you good at what you do? I didnt hesitate with an answer, I said yes right away. I actually surprised myself when I did that. I wasnt being cocky or arrogant, I was CONFIDENT. Why else would I be going out on my own if I didnt feel I had something to offer others? I will admit, it helped that my mentors boosted my confidence level. I was lucky to have 2 of them, both seasoned veterans in the field of copywriting. They were very encouraging about the talent they saw in me and it motivated me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Remind yourself that youre good at what you do  good at helping people, making them feel really comfortable, building their business, or helping them get out of overwhelm.
        </p>

         Get clear and then excited about doing what you do. When you feel yourself wavering, turn to your mentor, your coach, or a trusted colleague for support and theyll remind you of the gift that you have to offer. Theyll remind you of your brilliance. So keep that in mind and believe in yourself!

         For me, back in 1989, giving up was not an option! About 2 1/2 years into it, when times looked a bit shakey, I took a part time job. At first, I was embarrassed thinking people would see me working in a retail store and think I wasnt successful.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, I quickly let go of that when I realized the reason I was doing it was to keep my business going. And, here I am 25 years later. To inspire you to keep on keeping on, heres my favorite quote from Calvin Coolidge:
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius w Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence &amp; determination alone are omnipotent.
         </em>

          As a freelancer of about 6 years I learned a lot, and in my experience, the biggest mistake freelancers make have less to do with the job and more to do with
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Client talk and human psychology.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, most freelancers make an entrance declaring all their skills and resume. Thats great, but a client really wants to know one thing: Can you make it work? If you can answer that question, youre hired. If you can fulfill that question, youre paid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Communication is also key. Some clients dont mind a lag, but more times than not, they want to hear your confidence and progress. They want to know their time isnt being wasted, and their website or app is safe in your hands. A last mistake is bidding and accepting a job that cannot be completed in the allowed time. Having to cancel a job, or having the customer complain to support can take a lot, some from your time and some from your pocket.

         <strong>
          The #1 mistake freelancers make when first starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Not planning for the ebbs and flows of being a freelancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes business is booming but it is important to save and plan for the times when jobs are not as forthcoming.
        </p>
        <p>
         When working on a global online platform like Freelancer.com it is also important to understand the global market and how to work with clients who may be in another country and time zone.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are my top three tips for winning proposals as an online freelancer:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Read the project description carefully and tailor your bid to the specific needs of the employer. Whilst there are thousands of jobs being posted every day each project is unique and the client expects you to treat it that way! It is important that you understand the project and that this comes across when you write the bid. Be clear, concise and to the point when writing your bid and make sure you articulate your unique selling point and why you are the best freelancer for the job. Remember, if you have any questions about the project dont hesitate to write to the client and ask!
        </p>
        <p>
         2. Samples and examples of previous work are great tools to get you noticed. Once you have entered your bid follow up with a private message of some of your previous work. It is important that the samples are relevant to the task that you are bidding on and remember quality, not quantity is the rule of thumb when submitting samples.
        </p>
        <p>
         3. Know the market and be competitive with your pricing. By competitive I mean bid smart not necessarily cheap. Clients are more often than not looking for high quality work as opposed to the lowest price. Clients will always look at freelancers reviews and recommendations and will be willing to pay more for a service provider who has a great reputation and has produced exceptional work.

         <strong>
          In my own business coaching practice, Ive worked with more than a thousand freelancers and SMEs through group coaching and event presentations. Most are clear about the basics, but make what I consider the number one mistake:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         They only have a single price for their services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most freelancers have a very simple business model of selling their time for an hourly rate, which is based on the number of hours they have available each month. This is why so many freelancers find themselves back at a job within 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         I built my business coaching practice from nothing to $400,000, twice in different countries, by using Variable Pricing. Lets say I need ten clients to run my business. Most freelancers will set a fee, which is their monthly target divided by ten. My strategy was different.
        </p>
        <p>
         My first two clients received a discount, and I told them that so they were delighted. The next four clients invest my normal rate, and that rate is based on being able to live if I only had these first six clients. This means that the last four clients are all profit, a challenge for me to demonstrate my value so strongly that they paid a premium over my target rate and a fee not based on hours delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was successful for two reasons. Firstly, it meant I was busy immediately and had clients at all times. There is nothing worse as a freelancer than having no work. Secondly, when those early clients finished their projects with me, new clients were coming on board at a premium rate. And the busier I get, the higher my rates go. Current clients are investing four times what those first clients paid, and receiving a significant return on investment so they remain delighted. Its so much more sensible than fixed prices..

          In my experience, the #1 mistake freelancers (including freelance consultants) make starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Setting their rates too low. People tend to do one of three mistakes:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Set their hourly rates based on what normal rates are for full time employees (which is a mistake because that doesnt cover in things like insurance, taxes, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
         2. Set their hourly rates without considering in billable time vs. nonbillable time. Most freelancers are lucky to get 20 hours of billable time in a week (and thats on the high end), so if you set an hourly rate based on a 40 hour work week, youre likely to fall short.
        </p>
        <p>
         3. Set their hourly rates without considering in the amount of admin time, etc. associated with each billable hour of work. For example, bill $100/hr for each hour consulting  is that still a good rate for you after you factor in the prep work, transportation time (if any), and so on?

         Misunderstanding, or assuming, the clients needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I notice is, whenever they have a client, they are so eager to provide them advice, ideas and what not without really understanding the current situation of the client. Some of these advice works but most of them does not. These mistakes are often corrected on their next client or the next. The main reason to this is that, although these people are professionals, they tend to think of doing the job themselves which is very different in advising someone on how to do it.

         The biggest mistake Ive seen new freelance consultants make is

        <p>
         Not knowing how to find job leads.
        </p>
        <p>
         You need to know that companies are often hiring freelancers in a huge variety of fields, and that simply searching freelance consultant isnt going to get you to the job openings. Instead, identify specifically what youre expertise is, and search for freelance consulting jobs that way. You might be a human resources consultant, or a web development consultant, or a nursing consultant. Be specific in your searches and youll find many more leads!

         Not automating.
        </p>
        <p>
         Theres only a few things you can get done in a day as one person. But theres so much to do when starting out. If you dont create a simple, but scalable system to handle invoices, customer service for your clients, marketing, and proposal creation, youll get stuck doing a lot of boring, monotonous work that makes you hate freelancing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just once a week, choose a task you hate doing the most and find a way to automate it. For instance, if you hate doing invoicing use a free tool like Wave Accounting to handle your invoices and accounting automatically. If you hate following up with prospective clients using a tool like Autosend to automatically send them an email, push notification, or text message based where they are in the buying process.

        </p>
        <p>
         If youre going to be a consultant/expert in an industry where represent/assist certain clients, you need to know the industry inside and out  if you service various industries, you must be on top of the industry and have the know-how in order to be prepared to answer your clients questions and help them succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, you also need to know what it takes to be a consultant such as: how much to charge, what services you should be offering, what type of website you would like to have, and everything else that goes into how to sell yourself and convince clients to hire you. Consulting is a dog-eat-dog business and in order to succeed you must be equipped all the proper information. Knowledge is power.

        <p>
         Starting out way too generalized.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you approach a potential new client in a general way, there is nothing there that gets them excited about why they should hire them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why are they different? What can they offer that they cant get from somewhere else? The more niched you become, the more in demand youll be. It also helps finding potential clients as well, because you wont go to generalized networking events. Instead, youll be very specific about the clients you target, and have a much greater response rate in the process.

          The number one mistake people new to freelance consulting make when starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Not sticking to their expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
         For instance in published media  write about what you are knowledgeable about. As a company who deals with technology media we sometimes see writers will accepts jobs just because they could use the work. However, if you cover a topic you not familiar with, it shows in your writing. When these stories, which are typically read by people with a background on the topic, dont resonate with that audience, it will impact the potential for future writing assignments. Readers feedback is easy to gauge with comment sections and social media, so a story that doesnt hit the mark reflects poorly in the media outlet and on you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another tip for freelancers: dont be afraid to say no.
        </p>
        <p>
         The media and/or clients will appreciate your honesty and it will keep the door open for future assignments. When youre starting out, its important that your first bunch of stories is extremely well done. With fewer (published) materials for your prospects to review, its critical the ones they see reflect your true ability. A few great stories will have more impact than a dozen average ones. Stick to what you know and broaden your expertise by covering related topics. You will pick up new coverage topics before you realize it.

          The biggest mistake a freelance consultant can make when starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Failing to identify and stick to a focus.
        </p>
        <p>
         This seems like a simple concept but is certainly more difficult to accomplish in practice. Most freelancers are confident in their ability to deliver value for their clients; hence the reason they are in business for themselves. It becomes tempting for freelancers to dream of the dozens of ways they can earn a paid contract. I too fell into this trap.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I went out on my own I wrote a business plan that identified 14 ways to get paid via products and services. It took me 30 days to discover that only 5 of these products and
         <br/>
         services truly support my focus. The remaining 9 products and services had the potential of confusing my brand and wasting my time. I spent significant time developing prototypes for services that I would probably never use. There is certainly value in experimentation but a new freelancer should focus mainly on an identified niche and be disciplined to work on only activities that align with their focus.

         A great website, wonderful calls to action and excellent funneling that pushes everyone perfectly is nice, but it doesnt get people to notice you. With eight new websites launching per minute, theres a likely chance that even more competitors are coming online every day. You will be lost in the crowd, which means that you need to market yourself in actual real life.

        <p>
         I did this by Chamber of Commerce meetings where you werent meeting up with your competition, but your client base. Most of my clients are referrals from existing clients, ensuring that I have passive marketing through satisfied clients.

          The number one mistake that we see new freelance consultants make is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Not fully understanding or preparing for their year-end taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
         More specifically, they dont fully understand that they will have to pay Self-Employment (SE) tax on the net income earned from their consulting business. This current tax rate is 15.3 percent and is on top of the federal and state income tax they will owe on their bottom line. This whopping 15.3 percent tax covers federally mandated Social Security and Medicare taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an employee, they were used to having 7.65 percent FICA tax withheld from their wages. However, most people arent aware that their employer has to match that FICA tax and pay in another 7.65%. This means that the total tax is 15.3 percent (7.65% times two.) As a freelance consultant they will be required to pay both halves of the FICA (called SE tax for self-employed individuals.) If the consultant is operating as a corporation then this tax will be treated differently, split equally between the employer (the corporation) and the consultant (the employee.) However, the overall tax rate will still total to 15.3 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first time the consultant meets with their tax accountant, they are usually informed of a rather large tax bill and they are stunned by the news. As it is with most bad news, it usually hits when the consultant can least afford to pay this chunk of tax dollars. We make sure our clients fully understand their tax obligations on any type of self-employment income so there are no surprises. They need to understand the impact of taxes before they launch their business in order for them to correctly determine the consulting rate to charge.

        <p>
         Undervalue their services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Often freelancers start out with an hourly rate that may have been derived from the wages they received at their previous job. This is completely inadequate, as it does not take into consideration the following facts:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. You will not be employed 2000 hours per year  ever. And, definitely not in the first year.
         <br/>
         2. You will need to pay for supplies, gas, phone, internet, parking, business cards, advertising etc. out of the fees you earn.
         <br/>
         3. In the event that you grow a business that needs to expand into offices, you will have to raise your fees to pay the rent  your clients will not be interested in paying more so that you can have an office.
        </p>
        <p>
         Be sure to research competitive rates. And, consider charging for the services you will deliver based on the results/outcome (e.g., web site for $1000 rather than trying to estimate the # of hours).

        </p>
        <p>
         Overpromising or making lofty promises to woo clients early on.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most important thing when first starting out any freelance career is building a solid reputation and a high quality base of clients, overpromising can only help to sully your slowly growing reputation and prevent you getting word-of-mouth referrals. Through my experience, I have found the best policy for customer relations is being upfront, and even under promising, so as to have the maximum room for a customer satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
         This also benefits the freelancer, as not overselling yourself or services will not have you feeling that youre in over your head or unable to meet the needs of your clients. Be straightforward and be realistic in line with your business goals and your clients needs and the rest will follow. Leave the used car salesman act on the car lot.

          The number one mistake that people who are new to freelance consulting make when starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Filling their practice with enough work to create a full-time assignment and then they focus all of their time, energy and effort on the work (and nothing else).
        </p>
        <p>
         In todays freelance economy, networking, marketing and sales must be an on-going practice. The client work that creates a full book of business today will eventually be gone. Its imperative to continually be networking and building a pipeline so that when the current work ends youre not left asking, What now?

         Not charging enough.

         I did it, and Ive seen it done over and over. People new to a business do not charge enough for the value their services are providing. You shouldnt feel sorry for taking someones money. If youre offering a value, and its worth the money to the other side, youre doing yourself and the customer a service.

         I believe the number one mistake people new to freelance consulting make when starting out is
        </p>
        <p>
         Failing to plan appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
         They may not consider setting up accounting/invoicing/taxes, having clients in place from the get-go, having their office systems (phone/email/equipment) set up, establishing a web site, printing business cards, etc. This sets them up for struggles that dont need to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before hanging out ones shingle, they should be prepared with all the necessary pieces in place for them to focus on client work. There are great resources to help with all these things, but the best piece of advice I can give is for them to talk with other successful freelancers to find out what theyre doing. That really helped me get the systems I needed in place before I started consulting.
         <br/>
         One other recommendation is to have at least six months of savings to live on and to make sure you have health insurance lined up-perhaps through your spouse, if possible, or through an agent who specializes in working with the self-employed.

         The idea that If you build it, they will come.
        </p>
        <p>
         Im referring of course to a web site. With all the competition in the consulting space, getting traffic to your consulting website is a very expensive proposition. All of the main search engine keywords for your industry are likely bid up to a very high price. It is rare that a web site will directly bring in new clients. Instead, new clients are obtained through intensive networking through both social media and person to person. Most of my clients have come through referrals made by former customers.

         <strong>
          I would say the biggest mistake people new to freelance consulting make when starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Not identifying (and sticking to) their ideal client.
        </p>
        <p>
         I personally made this mistake in the beginning when I was just freelancing and it made for some miserable moments. I had 1 client who was definitely not my ideal client, but because I didnt identify what made an ideal client for me, I didnt realize it until it was too late.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would suspect the main reason for people to go into freelancing is to find more enjoyment in their work. They cant do that if they will work for anyone just to get paid. Yes, getting paid is important but more important is making the time you spend working more enjoyable. Otherwise, you may end up quitting and missing out on the benefits of freelancing.

          The number one mistake freelancers make when starting out is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Spreading themselves to thin.
        </p>
        <p>
         The easiest and quickest ways for this to happen is by offering too many products or services. But I see many freelancers also get overwhelmed by spreading themselves out on too many sites or marketing avenues. If youre all over the place in the services you provide and how you get your clients youll never find a rhythm to your work.
        </p>
        <p>
         You dont want to brand yourself as a Jack of All Trades. This will just lead to sleepless nights learning how to do the work instead of actually getting the work done and moving on to the next gig.
        </p>
        <p>
         The key is to find the 3-4 products/services that bring in the highest margins(profits) and can be easily full filled. Your goal is to make an assembly line for these 3-4 products/services.
        </p>
        <p>

         Not having contracts with their clients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Requiring clients to sign contracts will help freelancers protect themselves and their work. Apart from the clients basic personal and business contact information, you also need to state  as specifically as possible  what the client is paying for (how many hours of consulting, the projects scope, how many revisions, how many client communications and status reports they can expect, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
         You also need to outline your billing procedure: how you invoice, how you prefer to be paid, payment due dates, etc. Finally, outline the projects cancellation policy! A cancellation clause will protect you in case your client backs out before termination of the project.

        <p>
         Not understanding what clients they are targeting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Instead many freelancers take a shotgun approach, promoting themselves everywhere and quoting any work that may come their way. This leads to time lost chasing projects that you are unlikely to win, or taking on projects at a lower rate than your goal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The time lost on unlikely sales opportunity or poorly paying projects is time that could have been spent pursuing the quality opportunities that will help you grow your business and reach your income goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         To earn higher rates and get more work, it is critical to identify what types of clients are the best fit for your services. Think about ideal client size, types of industries that are likely to desire your work, and of course, willingness to pay for your services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Put all your focus and efforts on targeting this type of client. Learn how to best reach them, learn what their priorities are, learn what types of budgets they typically have, learn everything you can. Once you know how to find your ideal clients, and how to create solutions they want, it becomes far easier to find work and earn higher rates.

         <strong>
          In my experience, Ive noticed a mistake that new freelancers often make is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Not understanding the value of the work portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
         When youre a freelancer, you need to work hard on business development. However, you shouldnt have to be selling yourself too hard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whats that? Develop new business but dont sell yourself? Many new freelancers misunderstand the value of having a great portfolio of work to show. Your work should do the selling for you. You have to find out whos hiring and what projects are available, but if you find yourself trying to justify why you should get the assignment, youve probably made a wrong turn somewhere in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         People that hire freelancers want to have a lot of confidence in you before they give you the work. They can get that confidence from references, but nothing is better than the work itself, especially if its from brand name clients. In my work, which mostly involves writing long-form content for technology companies, I can approach a new client and say, I write white papers for Microsoft and Advanced Micro Devices. How can I help you? I dont get into, Please, please trust me. Ill do a great job. My work speaks for itself, or at least I hope it does. But, having a great work portfolio changes the nature of the freelance hiring discussion. The confidence building occurs up front. The conversation is about
         <em>
          how
         </em>
         youre going to do a great job, not
         <em>
          if
         </em>
         youre going to do a great job.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, of course, the big question looms: How do you develop a work portfolio? The answer is you have to be flexible and creative when you start your freelance career. It took me years to put together an A list clientele, often working at low rates and doing special favors for people so I could assemble my sample set. Theres a great value in the portfolio. Its worth foregoing high fees in the beginning to put your portfolio together.

        </p>
        <p>
         People are afraid that no one will hire them if their prices are high, but, in fact, higher prices = greater success. If you dont charge enough for your work, people wont take you seriously. When you charge more, you can* take time off to renew yourself, improve your skills, and hire the help you need. You will be able to provide higher-class servicesand that will attract higher-class jobs and higher-class clients.

          I have years of experience as a freelancer prior to growing into a self standing company. I find that the biggest mistakes freelancers make are
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Time management. It is very hard to say no to a good project. So, you convince yourself that youll pull a few all nighters to get it done. This doesnt work all the time. many times your work suffers and clients dont use you again.
        </p>
        <p>
         2. Biting off more than you can chew. A freelancer dont have the resources large firms have. A freelancer has to realize that they are limited in resources. It is important to be up front about this right away with your client so tha expectations are accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
         3. Professionalism. Just because you are a freelancer doesnt mean you dont need contracts, agreement, proper paper work and project briefs. This helps you stay organized and prevents all sorts of problems in the long run.
