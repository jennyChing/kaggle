       Call it the rumor that wouldn't die. For decades, people in Japan have alleged that Sony installs a secret timer in its products that causes them to fail after a specific period of time.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
       <img alt="Sony timer? -- " src="http://pinktentacle.com/images/10/sony_timer_1.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation about the existence of this so-called "Sony timer" emerged in the 1980s and 1990s as consumers grew increasingly suspicious of Sony devices that stopped working just after the warranty expired. According to the theory, Sony's time-activated kill switches are designed to boost sales by driving consumers to purchase replacement parts, repairs, or new models (often the cheapest option) after a scheduled period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, decades after the rumors began, people still talk about the Sony timer. In 2006, after a string of laptop explosions prompted a global recall of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Sony Energy Devices Corporation, Japanese Internet forums were flooded with sarcastic comments raving about how effective the latest generation of Sony timers had become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, much of the speculation about hidden Sony timers is tongue-in-cheek, but some people appear to take the claims seriously, pointing to the suspiciously precise timing of product failures as evidence of foul play. Regardless of whether or not Sony timers actually exist, the company has been dogged by the perception that its products break down just outside warranty.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
       <img alt="Sony timer? -- " src="http://pinktentacle.com/images/10/sony_timer_2.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although "Sony timer" has long been a household phrase in Japan, company officials have only rarely acknowledged the rumors in public. In June 2006, an executive who oversaw the establishment of the VAIO customer service center attracted attention when he mentioned the Sony timer in a speech at G-Force Japan, a large annual conference for the Japanese call center industry. "It's absurd to think that Sony would install timers that cause products to fail just 13 months after purchase," he told the audience. "But for some reason, people continue to have this perception. Our marketing, customer service and product development departments are making a deliberate and concerted effort to improve Sony's image," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a shareholders' meeting in June 2007, in a speech outlining new measures to ensure product quality and improve the Sony brand image, former company president (current vice-chairman) Ryoji Chubachi admitted he knew the phrase "Sony timer."
      </p>
      <p align="center">
       <img alt="Sony timer? -- " src="http://pinktentacle.com/images/10/sony_timer_3.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the decades of rumors and speculation, nobody has ever proven the existence of the Sony timer. Skeptics argue that if such timers actually existed, a rival company would likely have found one and made it public. With this in mind, the Sony timer is widely considered an urban legend.

                  wow will, i'm impressed... your comment really WAS hilarious, and truly deserving of the "hahahahahahaha" that you appended to it yourself, just in case nobody else realized how hilarious you are. i'm glad that someone appreciates the amazingly erudite and sophisticated sense of humor that you clearly posses.

                I've never experienced this, either, actually.  My friends and family have all griped about the timer as well, but I've Sony products for years and have never had an issue.  I've noticed that the people I know who complain about it also don't take very good care of their stuff.

                It makes perfect sense that this should happen without a dedicated "timer". To reduce the costs for making such a device, components are manufactured to a standard of quality which makes them last "at least the length of the warranty" as this makes the device as cheap as possible to manufacture, without having to supply an unreasonable amount of replacements.

            The batteries from that model (I have one) were recalled.  I suspect they were included under the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Sony Energy Devices Corporation that were mentioned in the article.

            If you notice, the burn is right where the battery would be, and the battery was manufactured by Sony.

              No, the burn is on the bottom right but that's not where the battery on a Macbook Pro is located. It's in the dead center on the underside of the laptop.

            Apple products have this. The iPhone store demos get a 'No Service' error or no bars error shortly after the warranty expires.

          Ford does this same sorta thing with their cars... But if things were built to last then most capitalist economies would crumble.. People would buy what they needed and they would never have to buy more... And buying more crap is what they want you to do... Eh, such is the "modern human condition".

              Actually, pandapants, it's your comment that's vapid and baseless, not to mention rather revealing of your below-average IQ. EFX makes a perfectly valid point about capitalist economies being founded upon planned obsolescence. And he/she probably put "modern human condition" in quotes to emphasise the crass consumerism driven by this basis that defines modern humanity.

                Actually he is right.

                A long time friend of my family was an electrical engineer and he said that when he worked for a company that did contracts for companies that need electronics, that ford contracted them to make the device that makes the turn signal tick.  He said when he designed it, it comprised of a very small thin piece of attached to one electrode and leaning on the other.  When current went through it,it would heat up and raise off the electrode it wasn't attached to.  He said when they brought the design to ford, that ford said it would last too long i.e. something like 1 million ticks and they wanted something much less.  I don't know then numbers, but my friend said he just made the piece of metal thinner so it would degrade in the wanted amount of clicks.

                This isn't a timer as in something they put in there to cause it to fail, but engineering things to go out at certain times.  This is the type of thing I think Sony may be in on.

                  i bought a used '95 cobra in '96 (so being released in '94 it was 2 years old). it had 67000 on the od and it was driven another 5 years and 70 thou more HARD miles. not one single component of any kind including light bulbs (not one) ever failed. it was absolutely the most dependable vehicle i have ever owned, (and i haven't talked to my nephew in going on 10 yrs for totaling while drunk). i don't know when your "friend" designed this but obviously they last.

          Got a Sony TV which I only replaced with an HD one after 12 years of service, all three of my Playstation consoles are still working... Nope, no sign of the dreaded Sony timer here. ^^

           <p>
            The only difference with that was that they timed it waaay wrong and their XBoxes were busted after only 11 months of use (or less).

            I find it funny when people who have clearly never studied economics beyond trolling drudge report make exclamations like that.  You sir, clearly never attended an economics class in your life or, if you had, you flunked.  Capitalist systems work fine with a savings rate as well.  You, like Michael Moore, have confused capitalism with corporatism.  Try again.

          @toro: Plenty of people already bash Microsoft, but at least MS has done a better job of containing the damage to their consumer reputation, e.g., Xbox 360 RROD.

          I laugh at the idea, everything Sony I have work the day it did brand new, batteries don't count of course. Even my PS1 still plays good as new.

          Yeah, I first heard about "Sony time" (as I thought I heard it) from a Japanese friend who won't buy Sony. Well, the Vaio that I had, which was a very pretty lavendery-grey laptop like the one in the top photo (always got comments due to its nice color frame and tininess), literally fell to pieces. Bits and pieces. It was out of warranty by several months or a year, but...suffice it to say I didn't have a lot of interest in buying Sony again, even if it was just a lemon. When I heard the "Sony time" thing I cracked up. I have really fond memories of my Walkman, though. That thing kept going forever!

          Oh yeah, my PS2 is a workhorse as well! And that Japanese friend will buy Playstation items, just not any of their computers or certain other divisions' items. I'm not sure about the fine points of which Sony divisions are supposed to be crap.

            Must say, as much as this is more than likely a big urban legend, I did have two PS2s die the very next day after the warrenty ran out. Just to point out, I got one for christmas, and when it died I asked for a new one for my birthday, which did the exact same thing. I also know other people who experienced the same problem, and I was screaming "conspiracy!" well before I even knew there was such a thing as the "Sony Timer"
           </p>
           <p>
            Coincidence, more than likely. But the fact that its just after the warranty is up, it does kinda raise an eyebrow or two.

          like Sony, hope they'll be cool again. Cause they may have screwed up recently doesn't mean I'll just give up on them.   I remember they were cool when Morita was alive and the Walkman.

            I don't think Sony screwed up. This rumor is nothing more than an urban legend, and the fact that Sony is such a great success only makes them an easy target for talk like this. Try to see it as a compliment!
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, it is undeniable that many manufacturers (not just Sony) engage in "planned obsolescence", or designing products to fail or fall out of fashion after a certain period of time. It is an inevitable by-product of our mass-produced disposable consumer culture.

          Back in the day I had two pairs of Sony headphones.  One pair I used constantly the other pair was packaged up (they were actually my brothers but he never used them).  About a year later the pair I used broke... one of the speakers just stopped working.  I assumed it was just because of the abuse that I put them through.  So, I tossed them, unpackaged the new pair, and went on my merry way.  Two days later they failed in the exact same way as the other ones and had endured zero abuse.  There was no rhyme or reason as to why both pairs, purchased (and, I assume, manufactured) at the same time, would fail within days of each other, completely independent of usage.

            I guess that rumor is true in several devices, but not all and not only from sony. For example, my Canon DSLR which I always care like it was my children just suddenly stopped working just a few weeks after the warranty expired, good thing it was already repaired by the right person. The same thing also happened to my geforce gpu, and sadly it cannot be repaired.

          The hard drive in my one and only Vaio laptop went down the day after the warranty expired.  I never bought another Sony computer, not because I believed in the timer but because I COULDN'T believe that they refused to give me a one-day grace period.

            you will probably find that the drive manufacturer will warranty the drive for 5 years. if you remove it there should be a manufactured date on it and you should be able to get a replacement from them.

            You expect them to honor a warranty that's over?  What about two days?  A week?  A month?  A line has to be drawn somewhere; hey, why not use the last day of the stated period?

          My Sony laptop self destructed exactly after the two year warranty ended. I was plagued by this machine from day one. HUGE disappointment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sony's laptops are terrible - they put all of their effort into the PS3 - which is a great machine.
         </p>
         <p>
          They sued to be good machines - but not any more.

          Its called planned obsolecence and it is in everything. Parts are designed to fail after a certain length of time. Its not just Sony that do this but every single manufacturer of anything and everything.

          Quote: "Its absurd to think that Sony would install timers that cause products to fail just 13 months after purchase, he told the audience. But for some reason, people continue to have this perception. Our marketing, customer service and product development departments are making a deliberate and concerted effort to improve Sonys image, he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          Whether the timer is real or not, the fact that the perception is so pervasive and real points out that Sony products are not known for their longevity...many, many people find that their expensive SONY CamCorder or laptop simply and inexplicably quits working long before one might expect it to.
         </p>
         <p>
          If Sony is serious about combating this perception, rather than fine-tune their market image, perhaps their engineers should work on making them last longer because the real experience, whether it's a mystical timer or flawed manufacturing, is that Sony products simply do not last.

          Sony aren't too bad, and I don't believe they have "timers" judging by the number of Sony products I still have, still in full working order, long after their warranty's have expired.
         </p>
         <p>
          Plus, I have had nothing but nice experience with Sony UK, so far, for example:
         </p>
         <p>
          I had a Sony PS2 back in the day. When mom got ill, I packed it away in a cupboard, as I had no time to play it, as I had to nurse mom. She eventually died, and after grieving, I unpacked the Sony PS2 to play it. It was dead.
         </p>
         <p>
          I called Sony, to ask how much an out of warranty repair would be (the warranty had ended a month previous), and explained what had happened. The customer service guy said if I faxed a copy of moms death certificate to a # he gave me, they would do an out of warranty repair for free as a goodwill gesture.
         </p>
         <p>
          I sent them the fax, and he called me back to arrange a courier to pick it up. When the courier arrived, he wasn't picking up the dead PS2, but exchanging my dead PS2 for a brand new one for free, compliments of Sony UK.
         </p>
         <p>
          This was back in 2005.

          probably just means they have a better testing department that knows really well when their products are going to give out &amp; how long they can extend warranties so they don't end up having to do anything.

          i read the comments above about sony headphones, i was going through their "funtopia" earphones one every month, until i realised they were junk for a reason.
         </p>
         <p>
          but now i see a scary picture of a macbook pro, with fire damage... they have sony batteries.... i'm typing this on one... erm.... well actually i'm not too bothered, time is a great teller, YES i know things are designed to fail &amp; get replaced, but we HAVE progressed... now, things aren't designed to catch fire and/or injure people... because that costs THEM, not us.
         </p>
         <p>
          part failure is not just a sony thing... i've already fielded that one with apple (thanks, ifixit)... take a gamble, you might be able to fix it yourself (&amp; save some cash).

          Meh, it DOESN'T happen just as often as it does. Probably more. And how about products that fail within the warranty? You don't see floods of people on forums saying "My stuff broke.. they fixed it.. this is an awesome story". Or.. "My warranty expired.. but my stuff still works".
         </p>
         <p>
          People ONLY complain when their stuff breaks just after a warranty.. so it seems like 100% of the population is having this issue, whereas everyone else is just keeping quiet because there's nothing to complain about.

          My Sony laptop is still working well and out of warranty. Maybe I should send it in and tell them it won't self destruct. Maybe they can check to see if this one has no timer installed. After all, I did pay for a complete unit, didn't I ?

          Showing the picture of the faulty batteries is a bit misleading, but the timers do exist and I believe in multiple places within a device.
         </p>
         <p>
          I noticed one particular piece in my Sony CMTM100MDS, just after the warranty had ran out my input jack did the typical sony crackle, so I opened it up took out the offending jack port and had a look, the two metal arms that contact the plug had corroded or worn to a none conductive metal underneath, they were essentially a none conductive metal plated with a conductive one, it was also attached to a small board and chip which I have no idea what that did, I removed both and replaced it with a $5 jack port from radio shack and everything worked fine until my CD player died a few weeks later, I continued to use it as an amp for my TV for about a year until the whole thing stopped working for some reason, I was going to investigate it but never got round to it and eventually just threw out the unit.

          I bought a Panasonic microwave oven with lots of nice features; it could sense when the food was evenly heated and stop heating, was loaded with preprogrammed settings, had a carousel, blahblah.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just a few DAYS after the manufacturer's 1-year warranty expired, the microwave died, the LED display went dark and that was that.
         </p>
         <p>
          COINCIDENCE??? Maybe... then again, maybe not!

          I don't think the Sony products have it, both my Playstation and Playstation 2 are working fine years after the warranty expired. Although my iPod... That died maybe a few days after the warranty expired, so did a lot of my friend's apple products. I think Apple is a more of a culprit than Sony.

          It is sad people do not think this situation out.  Companies do research on how long their products last and use this data to formulate the quality of the materials used to make it, factored against price and come up with a good balance. A product needs to last as long as the warrenty and should not be expected to last beyond the products upgrade allotment before a newer technology is more usefull.

            Actually if you think it through you'll realize that what consumer wants and what the company wants are two different things: The consumer wants a product that will give the lowest cost per time.  So if given the choice between a product that costs $100 and lasts 2 years and one that costs $150 and lasts 4 years, the consumer will choose the one that costs $150 and lasts 4 years (assuming the consumer knows the expected lifetime of a product, which is usually a false assumption).  There will be an optimum cost/quality compromise which will produce the lowest cost per time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The company on the other hand, wants the customer to buy products with the highest cost per time.  Since the consumer does not know beforehand the expected lifetime of a product, the company can exploit this to make the consumer pay a high cost per time.  It does that by selling cheap, low quality items that break quickly.  Since the consumer doesn't know beforehand the lifetimes of different products, he/she will just buy the cheapest one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Warranties to make things a bit better for consumers, since they guarantee not having to buy a replacement within the warranty timeframe, but they're not perfect.  For one thing, warranties typically have long pages with fine print, and the consumer typically doesn't have the time to read the warranty of every product they're considering.  Also, companies will often try to weasel out of honoring warranties, sometimes successfully, which defeats the purpose of warranty and reduces its worth.  And there's also the hassle of sending the product back and waiting, which sometimes isn't even feasible if the consumer needs the product available immediately.  And there's also the shipping cost which isn't always covered.

          I have had terrible luck with sony products. I do not believe that there is any timer on the products. Junk just fails prematurely. My last sony item did not work out of the box, The hoops that the company wanted me to jump through just angered me further. I wrote it off as a LEARNING experience and will never purchase any more with the sony name. The camcorder lasted about 2  months past warranty. The repair would have been within 25%  of the cost of a new unit. The TV lasted about 1 year past warranty. We didn't even attempt to get it repaired. No more Sony for me.

          What is the fucking point of this article? If the timers don't exist, why write this article? I hadn't ever heard of such a thing as warranty timers before, and had to read half way through this fucking piece to find out that they've never been discovered. A complete waste of my time! Fuck the idiot that wrote this and as retribution, I am never coming back to this site. Fucktards!

          yea, companies have done similar things today.  Notice how if you pull your NES out of the attic, blow on a cartridge and plug the shit in, IT'LL STILL WORK!!!  But for some reason X-box 360's and PS3's can't withstand a few years... (originals seem to do fine, though, like PS1/2 and the first X-Box.. hmmm)

          Never heard of this, my old Sony products still work. Including my ancient PS1. And let me tell you, in it's hayday my sis and I used that thing like there was no tomorrow. Granted, I don't know when exactly the warrenty expired/expires, but I'm sure it's past it's prime. Maybe the kill switch is only in a number of models to avoid total suspiscion? If so, I feel pretty lucky atm. And a bit inspired to play a classic. Spyro party tonight!

          The more I read, the more suspicious I get about this 46" Sony Bravia HDTV.  I've come across countless articles of how they malfunction just outside warranty.  Even a pharmacist I work with mentioned that just after 2 years his Sony Bravia tv had turned green.  The whole screen became green with spots of red, he said.  I've looked and there have been several hundred thousand reports of Sony HDTVs malfunctioning.  I mentioned it to my friend because it's his TV and he's driving about 900 miles to retrieve it from my trailer.  I told him that I hope it isn't one of the defective ones, and he agreed.
         </p>
         <p>
          So far, there has been nothing wrong with the TV, but it was only purchased 10 months ago.  Only time can tell, but I'm certainly not buying anything from Sony, and I made that decision a while back and not due to the "Sony timer" myth either.  I don't buy from Sony because they've always been ones to screw over consumers with embedded DRM in their products.  I've only bought one thing from Sony, and they didn't get any money from me, because I bought my PSP used from Gamestop.

          Well, it's not like they need to install a physical timer, a little piece of technology, the strategy is called "planned obsolescence". Most companies plan an element of planned obsolescence into their products, keeps people buying new stuff, it's good the the economy right?
         </p>
         <p>
          It's not an urban legend at all, it's a fact of contemporary business practices.

          the sony timer is absolutely real. but it doesn't go off after 16 months. it goes off at about 3 to 4 years. i've owned sony video cameras, md recorders, car stereos, etc. for most my adult life. the one that made me a believer in this "myth" is the car stereo. i had a great sony detachable face car stereo i bought at circuit city back in 1999. about 4 years to the day the unit just shut off one day right after i started my car.
         </p>
         <p>
          by the time this happened i was already wise to sony's scam via other products of theirs i had owned that quit after 3 or 4 years. funny thing is, one day the unit forgot it wasn't supposed to work and started working for about 30 seconds then quit.
         </p>
         <p>
          after my car stereo died i replaced it with a pioneer unit and haven't had trouble with it in six years.
         </p>
         <p>
          oh yeah, and to add insult to injury, sony closed all their service centers and repair facilities in california about 8 years ago.

          so if you do have a sony product that needs fixing you have to send it to their headquarters in new jersey. they will charge you a minimum of $200 just to even look at whatever you sent them. then a technician who barely speaks engrish will call you and tell you it's gonna cost more than the unit's worth to fix it and that you should just go ahead and replace it with a new one.
         </p>
         <p>
          i will never buy another sony product as long as i live.

          part of the problem is higher tech (which generally means faster  and smaller) and the smaller something is the more heat affects it(and they often create more heat than their larger counter part). on top of that every manufacturer looks to minimize cost. to do this they subcontract to spec,or make it themselves, but spec generally only means that a part look and do what is expected, not the materials or quality of materials used. minimize cost is the key word. it took a few years but Japanese cars finally fell into the same frame of mind and recently had the largest recalls in their history. not necessarily due to bad engineering but cheap manufacturing.
          <br/>
          having said this, they do expect a given number of hours of what they consider normal use. but they test in continuous use. take the incandescent light bulb. it is said to last for 10,000 hrs., but that is continuous,  something around a year and 3 months. so we should see it last 2 and a half years with 12 hr days only at night (and most are on less than that), but they normally burn out in less than 6 months because the act of turning them on and off reduces the life span. many electronics act in similar ways. on/off/on/off/on/off tends to reduce it's life span.
          <br/>
          while laptops are supposed to be used in this way, one that is will not last as long as one that is setup as a home computer and left on all the time. poll some friends and see which ones (including desktops)shut them down every time they are not using them and those who just walk away and you will find that those who shut them down will have had many more problems than those who don't.

            I have used many electronics for years... I work with computers and tech support for a living. Power cycling *most* devices should not significantly effect their expected life cycle. I have run desktop computers as servers/routers behind ups's with top notch power filtering fall over capabilities and years of uptime, and have had hardware failures on those devices as often as i have had with other desktop devices i power cycle every day. Regarding planned obsolescence, this "myth" is true, many companies use testing data to select materials for production use which will last as long as they plan to support the product for, however the myth that this is necessary to keep the economy going is patentable false. If the company continues to innovate and release new and exciting products, users will but the new exciting toys and junk their old stuff *EVEN IF IT WORKS*, all this does is allow companies to be lazy and ride their current products for longer without as much R&amp;D into new things to boost profit margins. Finally, regarding "timers" in products. This, for the most part, is also false. Things like this would be quickly discovered by geeks and enthusiasts, if not rival companies in their sector and would be *VERY* bad press. Most of what makes this rumor tick is a combination of planned obsolescence, the fact that people only complain when things break, not when they work, and manufacturing and hardware defects combined with natural paranoia and people wanting to think they've been "screwed" over. The truth is if there were "timers" in devices, no one would offer 3rd party warranties, because there would be no money in selling them. Today most add-on warranties sold are scams because chances are your product wont fail (of if it does it wont be nearly the cost of the warranty to get it fixed) within the time frame you buy. And for the record, i have a samsung tv (i love samsung displays!) that died no more than a week after the 1 year warranty expired. I managed to fix it myself for under $5. All that happened was the capacitors on the power supply had popped (a bad batch maybe - see manufacturing defect). The replacement caps were under a buck each, which i needed 2 of (i didnt even have to buy them as i scavenged extras out of old electronics) plus the cost of the solder, flux, and electricity to run the soldering iron... had the thing fixed in 20 mins... and its been working for another year w/o anymore problems.... was this a "timer"? no... was it "planned obsolescence"? it probably played a factor in it because of the capacitor manufacturer they chose. was this a "hardware defect"? yes, it was. samsung got a batch of faulty capacitors which can fail way earlier than the products expected life cycle. I doubt it was intentional, or that someone wanted this product to fail in this manner, as it was a cheap and easy fix. Getting online and looking up my model, i see hundreds of people complaining about the same issue... i would be lead to beleave that this was "planned" but its just random chance, and it effected many many many people. (samsung model number: LN40A540P2F or LN40A540P2FXZA)

              similar to my insignia(researched and found to be LG) plasma tv. though i'm not good enough to have noticed the bad caps until after gettring a replacement power board for 26 bucks, but i now have the old board with replaced caps for when/if it goes down again.
              <br/>
              our only disagreement is the cycling. of which i have no real tech claims except experience.
              <br/>
              i do wish i new how to trouble shoot boards. i am an electrician with much experience in controls, but once it gets to the circuit board level i'm admittedly lost.

          if you buy sony buy the new product in it's first production run as those units will be of the best quality because on the following runs the product is produce cheaper and cheaper. this is why some folks stuff last years and others die quickly.

          It is the fact of the matter with anything that has traces or conduits for current and electricity to go through. Eventually a part within a computer, appliance, or video game system is just going to fail. It really depends on usage patterns and the average general quality of parts in the system. Laptops are notorious for their lifespans because they pack so much electrical components in a small space and if they are not properly cared for and cooled, then the lifespan will be much lower until failure. Other things like my old SNES died after 15 years of use mainly because parts have various quality and lifespans.

          I have never heard of the "timer", but I have long suspected many computer companies doing this sort of underhanded thing. Why not in their eyes right? If they built long lasting products, then no one would ever need a replacement.

          I think the "timer" theory may be true.  They can't do it for every product, that's too obvious.  So, they make some to last and some to fail.  The ones that fail boost their profits, the ones that last uphold their image to some degree. At least they won't look any worse than any given manufacturer.  So, the ones of us who got stuck with a fail product can never see eye to eye with the ones of us whose products have lasted.  They think we're conspiracy theorists and we think they're just flukes who got lucky.  My experience with Sony has been a disappointment since I purchased my first PlayStation.   It failed within 2 years. My PS2 failed within 2 years, and my brand new Vaio laptop failed within 7 months and took 4 months to repair because of the runaround with tech support.  I'm waiting for a YLOD on my PS3 any day now.  I do not mind coughing up more money on a Sony product if it's going to be QUALITY.  I bought that laptop for school specifically and it failed before I could even finish my senior year.  They really want a better image? Stand behind your products for longer than a year! You think people can just go out and buy a $1,000 laptop yearly?!  Not in this economy.  You think people enjoy paying hundreds of dollars for an extended service plan (on top of the obscene price they already paid) when you should be covering that in the first place?  Nope.  It's underhanded, dirty way of doing business.  "Let's see....I paid a grand for a laptop that failed within a year. It took four months to repair and now I have 90 days left on my warranty and no confidence in the product whatsoever.  Sony rox!!!"

          I am certain that there is some manner of a "Sony timer" in (especially in older ones, but new Slims too!) Sony Playstation 3s. The failure percentages for those things are ridiculously high. Often just after expiration of warranty too... Just check the Sony forums if you don't take my word for it.

          I worked for a company that made microchips for a leading game manufactures in the 80's. One the process was to remove acid from etched metal conductors. To be fully rinsed we measured resistivity to 12.0 meg ohms.  To ensure that chips failed in 3-5 years we rinsed to 8.0 meg ohms leaving enough residue to eat through the conductors with the aid of heat from normal usage. We made tens of thousands of these chips with built in fail timers.

            Ohh yea!? Right.. I'm agreed with you on that 'attempt'! The microprocessor circuit is super sensitive to the change of resistance, capacitive or pulling down current to the ground at the end will cause functionality damage. That's all I got when doing the same process. But most of the rinsed metal conductors/ coppers should have been masked/ clear coated to avoid rusting. By the way, it was true to be right that as a destructive 'timer'..

          Not so much a timer but have you heard of accelerated stress testing
          <br/>
          They manufacture the hardware to only last just beyond the warranty. All companies do

          I've had an Xbox 360 since they came out, and I got a PS3 shortly after I got my Xbox 360, I've never had a problem with the Xbox, I can't say the same for the PS3... :-/

         <p>
          Companies use statistics to figure out when their machines will most likely wear out, and set the warranty date just before that.  Thinking that there is a secret timer in every machine is ridiculous

          I agree with Luke!  I've had a couple of macs and quite a few Sony peripherals and they all seem to want to die right after the warranty. If it isn't the products, its the batteries, power cord, etc.  Hmmmm maybe somethings wrong with my stuff or maybe that timer thing has taken on another shape

          I really don't believe that Sony Timer thing, because if it exists someone on the electronic area had discovered, but i study electronics and i know it's possible to make a electronic circuit that only work for a certain period of time, making the production of the products much cheaper... We already have the technology to make machines that don't wear out with time, but they have a very expensive production and the most companies don't want the products to last... but this not only happen with sony, every brand is making this in this days...

          Well, I don't know about you guys, but in Nigeria where I'm from people use these electronics for years after expiration of their warranties. I grew up with Sony products, right from the record player to the walkman, its my father's favourite. I'm a grown man now, I have a Sony dvd set for almost 5years and lcd for over 2years and they still work like day one. I don't have a very good experience with Sharp and LG. Those are brand names I won't get close to again. As for me, Sony is it.
