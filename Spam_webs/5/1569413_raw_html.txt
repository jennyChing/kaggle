        Election boundary and polling station geo data for Kenya can now be downloaded.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Kenyans are gearing up for the presidential election in March, including the tech community projects like
       <a href="http://uchaguzi.co.ke/">
        Uchaguzi
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.mapkibera.org/blog/2012/11/23/opinion-leaders-nominated-to-lead-election-monitoring/">
        Map Kibera
       </a>
       . One limiting factor is availability of data. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) finalized new constituency boundaries earlier this year, but have only
       <a href="http://iebc.or.ke/index.php/resources/downloads/category/bou-ndaries">
        released non-machine readable pdf maps
       </a>
       . Thats led Map Kibera to resurvey on the ground the new boundaries and polling places, in Kibera, Mathare and Mukuru. But outside that excellent work, open data on the most primary geographies of democracy are not available for Kenya. Election boundaries should be the number one data available on
       <a href="https://opendata.go.ke/">
        OpenDataKE
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The IEBC released a nice site to
       <a href="http://vote.iebc.or.ke/">
        look up Kenyan polling places
       </a>
       . It doesnt directly offer download, but quickly looking at network requests for the app revealed simple endpoints to request json versions of constituency and county boundaries, and the locations of polling places. I wrote a script which iterates through every ward in Kenya, caches the data, and produces outputs. There are
       <a href="https://github.com/mikelmaron/kenya-election-data/tree/master/output">
        shapefiles for download here
       </a>
       . If you need something tweaked, let me know, and Ill see what I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       <iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/groundtruth.map-t5fddslr.html#6/0.05320294496605108/37.47436523437501" width="500">

       This map displays approximately 16000 polling places across Kenya. In total, there are 26447, but a significant number are not mapped. Also, there are no ward boundaries available. This is a big opportunity for Kenyans to contribute back to their governments data. For instance, Lindi Mosque has no location in the government data set, but is
       <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/612007074">
        present in OpenStreetMap
       </a>
       . Would be possible to repurpose some OpenStreetMap microtasking tools to quickly map these places (
       <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">
        HOT Tasking Server
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://sandy.hotosm.org/">
        MapMill
       </a>
       or
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapRoulette">
        MapRoulette
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why make this data open? So we can build things like
       <br/>
       * Send an SMS to get a list of polling places in your ward
       <br/>
       * Geocoder and custom base maps to make it easier to locate reports to Uchaguzi
       <br/>
       * Print map services, so you can easily distribute polling place locations in your area
       <br/>
       * Analysis, such as distribution of polling places according to population density
       <br/>
       and plenty of creative things I havent imagined yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this step of action, then begging forgiveness rather than asking permission (in I hope the best tradition of mySociety) will spark curiosity and consideration by the IEBC to more fully embrace openness, not only by releasing data, but inviting conversation and feedback from the citizens it serves, and becoming more transparent in how decisions are made and how the complicated and incredibly important business of running an election is being carried out.

       Recently finished a technical review of
       <a href="http://drc.moabi.org/">
        WWFs Moabi platform
       </a>
       , their geodata sharing platform to track deforestation, and came out with some important technical challenges for the GeoWeb I want to share with the mapping nerds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just following
       <a href="http://groundtruth.in/2011/11/29/revealing-transparency-and-its-relation-to-community-empowerment/">
        TAIs bridging session on natural resource governance
       </a>
       , I met
       <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/science/staff/charles-huang.html">
        Charles Huang
       </a>
       of the World Wildlife Fund at a
       <a href="http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/event/mapping-and-technology-improve-governance-natural-resources">
        similarly styled event at the World Bank
       </a>
       . After self-identifying as a developer, Charles asked if Id like to talk more about Moabi  they needed a developers eye on the platform as they considered how to move to their 2.0. This isnt GroundTruths usual sort of work, but considering the TAI Bridge effort to connect technologists with sector experts, our
       <a href="http://groundtruth.in/2012/04/16/welcome-to-grassroots-al-quds-network/">
        other work with Drupal and mapping
       </a>
       , and my own deep interest in conservation, I dove in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moabi is ambitious. In its current expression with DRC and deforestation, the platform is meant to collect geographic data and detailed profiles from all sorts of courses, including the crowd, on everything from mining concessions, informal logging, road construction, to REDD projects, and enable conversation and coordination among everyone conservation workers on the ground, government officials, and the interested public on the other side of the world. And in the long run, this platform is intended to apply to other places and focus areas of WWF. This is such an ambitious, wide mandate, and I think touches on 3 key technical developments for the GeoWeb.

      </p>
      <p>
       In Moabi, every single feature, such as an individual mine or road, has a profile page, which should be shareable, pivotable, a focus point for social interaction among people and groups organizing to prevent deforestation. Most often in GIS and web mapping, we talk about layers of information, and while individual features often have expression in various forms on a site, there is no open source software package that deals with feature-level data in this way out of the box. And theres not really that many examples to draw on. Every feature in OpenStreetMap has an individual url, with details on its tags, last editor, etc. But its not quite used as a social object, excepting maybe
       <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/09/28/thats-maybe-a-bit-too-dorky-even-for-us/">
        the awesome machine tag integration with flickr
       </a>
       . Foursquare has some elements of this, every venue primarily being a place, and users able to connect to that place. But besides these sorta examples, a geographic feature is generally treated as a property of social objects, rather than social objects in themselves.
      </p>

       <b>
        Multi-master sync and flexible schemas
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Data is Moabi is sourced from both government, civil society, and interactions on the site. Those source databases are very likely to update over time, and very possibly they will receive updates on Moabi as well. Given a foreign key, or even a clever lookup, at least identifying which features have updated is possible. But this inevitably leads to thorny issues of handling conflicts during synchronization. This is commonly experienced in the simple situation of editing in OSM during a mapping party, where two editors independently modify the same feature. The OSM API can detect the potential conflict, but once detected the interface and process to resolve the conflict in JOSM is not intuitive or easy at all. When writing code, this situation happens all the time, and simply being text, its simple enough to throw the problem to the programmer to resolve. But were talking about geographic features here, and thats going to take very well designed interfaces to solve properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       A related issue is that a single feature may contain pieces of information from several different masters. Take roads. Yes, common enough is the geometry, maybe the name (or names) of the road, the surface. But with Moabi, they may also want to know if the road has a regular anti-poaching patrol, or if its commonly used to transport lumber. OSM deals with this unpredictability of attributes through tags, arbitrary key-value pairs, with no predetermined mandated structure, with conventions of use worked out over time. In contrast, traditional GIS requires pre-decided database schema, leading to long running discussions which often never resolve to the point of actually collecting and sharing data. So why not just use OSM? Well Im not sure its best to keep every single thing interesting to Moabi about roads in OSM, and some features, like say mining concessions or REDD projects, may simply not be appropriate for OSM (this is up for discussion of course). So assuming that something else is needed, what are the options for a tagging based system thats not OSM? The closest Ive seen is Matt Bergs work at Earth Institute on
       <a href="https://github.com/mangroveorg/georegistry#readme">
        georegistery
       </a>
       , an open source db with RESTful API for sharing and versioning geographic objects in GeoJSON, with arbitrary attributes.

        Complex interactive experiences without a lot of fuss
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Moabi has a lot of data, two dozen layers, thousands of features. Currently the only way to work through the data is via query, which can be a little slow both in usability and response time. Interactive exploration is best accomplished through Tiles and Grids, as enabled so well in TileMill and MapBox. And theres been a
       <a href="https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/244">
        lot of activity in OpenLayers with Grids
       </a>
       , including support for interaction in multiple layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue comes with how to make this architecture efficiently queryable. Say you wanted to show only to show mines operated by Chinese companies in the DRC, which are not located in mining concessions. The most obvious way is to send this query to the server, and render the result on the client side. But perhaps there are other ways, utilising the same approach
       <a href="http://mapbox.com/blog/custom-styles-mapbox-streets/">
        MapBox Streets takes to customize styles on the fly
       </a>
       , by manipulating the color table of tile images. If a tile set handled just a single layer, then the color table could someohow be used to encode other properties. This would essentially pre-can a set of interesting queries during tile generation, with the query results rendered by the server. If thats too limiting, perhaps we need to start thinking further in the future, where something like SVG based tiles could be efficiently rendered and queried in the browser.

       The sociality of OSM is its biggest strength. The intricacies of maps, tags, places are discussed in minute detail, and are ultimately the result of conversation, not top down dictate. The result are maps that are more expressive for more situations than any other platform. And we even meet in person! At the pub, the hack weekend, the LogCluster meeting. Anyone whos ever been to a State of the Map conference can attest, its a vibrant, fun, exciting

       OSM has hundreds of thousands of users, and hundreds of millions of map features. Yet the tools to connect to mappers and monitor an area are still the same as 5 years ago. Changing this is my wishlist  and yes, I know that most all of OSM features are coded voluntarily, and its something I could do myself rather than list out  I appreciate all the time and energy that goes into OSM coding, this is my *wish* list.

        Finding the Local Community
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If Im travelling some place new for an event, I want to connect to the local OSM community, and the process is complicated and not obvious. First, browse to the area in OSM and click the History tab, which should show recent edits in the area. Problem is, this often includes large, global edits which overlap this local area and arent relevant. And if you page through in a somewhat mind-numbing fashion, the OSM rails app starts to have performance problems past page 5.
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OWL_(OpenStreetMap_Watch_List)">
        OWL
       </a>
       is potentially a solution to this, but it has
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Top_Ten_Tasks#OWL-powered_activity.2Fhistory_tab">
        already been a priority development item for years
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And what the history tab wont do in either form is tell you who the most active, prominent mappers in the community are. For that, I usually jump over to ITOs excellent
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Mapper">
        OSM Mapper
       </a>
       , which present and visualizes summary statistics for an arbitrary area. Excellent, but you have to know its there, and it takes a separate authentication, and is a little counter intuitive to use. But from there, I have a list of 5-10 top mappers, with links to the OSM profile pages, from which I can send them a message. And wait, and hope they respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, Ill jump into the wiki, and look through the relevant
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/List_of_territory_based_projects">
        Wiki Projects
       </a>
       . Sometimes this will have listing of Users in an area, or links to their website, or mailing lists. The User profile pages sometimes have a way to contact that user, but just as often not. If theres a
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mailing_list">
        mailing list
       </a>
       , then its about subscribing to yet another mailing list, perhaps one in a foreign language, and posting. If theres a project website, thats usually golden and a sign of an active local community that will be responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Focusing Attention
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       And thats just for a one time connection. Most mappers have been involved in mapping many areas. How do you keep informed? You basically need to have a ton of RSS feeds, poke around the
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance#Monitoring_Tools">
        monitoring tools
       </a>
       , read a lot of lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of activity, most of the time, you only need to be dimly aware of. If a user with a good reputation is editing in a familiar area, theres little need to check into it further. If a new user has just signed up and is editing, it would be good to take a close look at their edits, and reach out and welcome them to OSM and offer to support their work. Reputation needs to be calculated, and used to filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not just edits. Theres so much going on in the community. The
       <a href="http://opengeodata.org/weekly-osm-summary-39">
        Weekly OSM Summary
       </a>
       is super useful, but is only the cream of the global activity. There are OSM events all the time,  but it seems
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Current_events">
        mostly German mappers are adding their events to the wiki
       </a>
       . Expand User Diaries so these posts are accessible in all sorts of ways, for all kinds of notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Being Social Should Be Simpler
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the general concept is around Interest. There are places you might be interested in. There are particular mappers and communities you might be interested in  either because theyre active in an area, or perhaps because they make suspicious edits. Directly in the OSM website, you should be able to manually indicate this interest (by friending a user, set a list of locations); or it can be automatically calculated through analysis and stats of where youve been active before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started on this idea by adding
       <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2012-January/024168.html">
        friend and home location filtering to Diary Entries and Changesets
       </a>
       . An ok start, but not everyone uses Diary entries to communicate, and the changesets still include everything  its both too much information and not enough. A lot is happening in OSM at any time, and you have limited attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres definitely a need for some system to do processing and analysis, from the planet diffs. Make these stats visually intriguing, and directly a part of a user or groups activity streams. Theres great experiments visualizing group stats with
       <a href="http://osmranking.altogetherlost.com/">

       , and

       <b>
        Social Design
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently the user profile page on OSM has two functions  one to view other people, and another as a dashboard for yourself. I think these should start to diverge into two different pages. The User Profile should be grown to give a better idea of what a mapper is up to. The Dashboard would be a focus point for a mapper to stay on top of everything they care about in OSM. So in one page, give a summary of what friends and nearby users are up to, but also whats happening in places you care about. For many users, myself included, there are many areas youve mapped, and would like to keep track of. Right now, you explicitly express interest by declaring your home location. This could be expanded to multiple, manually specified locations (my top 10 areas); or by analysis, a list of your top areas for editing could be automatically compiled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not only a design challenge, but its going to be an architected challenge as well. More social takes a lot more servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And dont require mappers to visit OSM.org to get this. Yes, send emails out with weekly summaries of activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some summary ideas for an activity stream:
      </p>
      <p>
       * Recent mapping activity in multiple areas youre interested in. Should be higher level than individual changesets (SteveCoast has made 12 edits over the last week in Seattle), but allow you to dig in further if you want.
       <br/>
       * Some visual distinction between trusted vs non-trusted
       <br/>
       * Also deal better with big edits, bots, etc. Filter these, or make them visually distinct.
       <br/>
       * New mappers in these areas, and their activity. Highlight these, its a good opportunity to reach out.
       <br/>
       * Highly trusted or experienced mappers in these areas, and their activity. Again, sometimes highlight, sometimes filter, depending on the need.
       <br/>
       * Non-mapping activity in the area  upcoming mapping parties, other local news.

Another lame attempt to boost American companies sales with puff pieces about their support for the Arab Spring.

       The real story here is the nature of crowdsourcing (a term Im increasingly despising), and power over and control of our geographic reality. Stefen Geens says that such false information, that politically motivated editing is a risk of crowdsourcing; its not, its rather the result of a false community and opaque processes.

      <p>
       Could this have happened on OpenStreetMap? Sort of. Anyone can edit anytime, I could change these names right now. The difference is that the change would be spotted soon by the community which cares for this data, all past changes by the user easily identifiable, discussion and questions posed in public, and reverts applied if necessary. In the event that the inaccurate edits ontinue, the case can be escalated to mediation, and the

       OpenStreetMap does not support the Assad regime, nor does it support the rebellion. It supports everyones access to the facts, and the equal ability for those common facts to respond to reality. OSM was the first map to display

       Arguments about the importance of Open Data often come down to a principled stance, or a licensing discussion  that kind of argument doesnt make much impression on folks who arent way in the weeds. And its more than just licensing  there are equal parts issues of legality, technical freedom, and community. Clear examples of what you can do only with OpenStreetMap, and not with say,

       Mapping of Jalabad and surrounding countryside is unique to OSM. They collect data with GPS and Smart Phones and Walking Papers. With GMM, you can only trace imagery on your laptop computer. With OSM you can go into the field to actually talk with people about what to put on the map. Afghanistan is not an option at all on MapMaker, for political reasons. And the Jalalagood guys are organized as a company, but do mapping largely in their free time, voluntarily  so they get nixed for being commercial.

       In Haiti,
       <a href="http://taptapmap.org/">
        TapTapMap
       </a>
       maps local bus routes, free to add any sort of data in OSM. In GMM, users are not allowed to add bus routes, only Google does that, and only by getting data from transit agencies. Haitis system, like many places in the developing world, does not have a single authority which maps and controls the routes. You can only get these routes by riding with your GPS.

This is not an area that can even be mapped in Google because of a political decision, its mostly blank on the map. While the map is free, its produced by a commercial entity and contains ads for local restaurants, hotels and sites.

        recent humanitarian response to flooding relied on open source tools
       </a>
       to process and make available satellite imagery to create OSM data. The GMM toolset would not permit integration of any other data sources except those controlled by Google. So it would stifle local ability to respond to disasters that dont make huge media splashes (G Crisis Response has not been active at all in the Philippines).

       Last weekend in Seattle, the OSM Foundation Board met face-to-face. We get together because no matter how much you try otherwise, theres way more done in person in a couple intensive days. It cost about 4 or 5k USD this time, and its worth the cost. But, I think weve always done a terrible job explaining what happens at the Board meetings, and a middling job following up, and those two things are totally related.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want this meeting to be different. It must be different. This is my fifth year on the Board and final year on the Board (I was elected again this year, but will stand down at the next AGM), and to me, and the entire Board, this is a crucial year for OSM. The face-to-face was the most productive yet, and the most difficult yet. Im very satisfied. In years past, the minutes get published, and various announcements go out through working groups, and that will happen.  But its insufficient, maybe distilling too far the atmosphere and the messiness of these get togethers.

       ! Except for the part where we spent 18 hours of our weekend discussing/arguing about OSM in windowless meeting rooms at Microsoft (which we very much appreciate btw!). And the rest of the weekend continuing to talk about it, or even dream about it. Being on the Board is a sacrifice of time, because we all feel deeply responsible to the project and our position.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Presentations
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board meeting proper started with presentations by Steve and Oliver. Steve hit many of the same themes from his SOTM and SOTM-EU talks, except he left out all the stuff about how awesome OSM is doing. We looked and discussed several graphs of recent statistics. OSMs growth to date has been beyond imagination, but theres no shortage of projects that changed the world and then met reality, hard. Looking at some of these, the factors in decline included insular community, lack of direction, and no innovation. Thats what we have to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oliver made the point that We are the Board! Shape the project!. The Board, and the Foundation, needs to be a functional team, with clear goals and activities, all within the limited volunteer time we have to contribute. Fact at this point is, the Foundation doesnt have clear objectives, beyond the mission to support but not control the OSM project. To meet goals, we can take action, we can guide and steer, we can spend money. At the end of workshop, there should be a target that guides all our activities towards achievement. Some of the slides were beyond funny management clip art (a guy looking forlorn into the mirror, facing reality) but the point was important. We are the Board! Shape the project!
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I thought it would be useful to look at some of the management lessons and differences from HOT. While we are by no means perfect, I do feel theres good alignment between the organizational side of HOT and the community, largely the same community as OSM. Contrast to OSMF, HOT is very focused in what it does, with clear guidance and priorities and steering. We arent afraid of spending money when its necessary. We value marketing by the organization (though could be better). There are clear technical needs, and we pay for it. Theres a key attention to the consumption side of map data collection, seeking strategic partnerships with other organizations. Weve been selective and directive with responsibility, and when necessary, have taken it away. We try to be as transparent as possible, publishing very detailed board minutes.

      <p>
       We took Olivers point and started strategic planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       OSMF Board meeting traditionally use a simple technique to come to consensus on a topic, whether its the agenda of the meeting, or in the case of Seattle, the objectives and activities of the OSMF this year. We brainstorm all our choices on the subject, write them on the whiteboard. Each person gets some number of votes, say 5, and distributes them among the topics. If topics can be grouped together, their count is added together. Theres discussion about the meaning of terms, sometimes a lot of discussion. Iteration to insure that we all have a common understanding. At the end, theres a list of priorities. I always squirm in this process, because somehow I dont believe it can work, but inevitably does a pretty good job, and if we need to override, were not strict about the methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       In less than an hour, we had these goals for 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The Worlds Most Used Map
       </b>
       OSM is clearly the worlds most used open map, and most open map, and the best map. We want as many people of possible contributing and using OSM, and to do that, the experience of using OSM needs to improve, and where you use OSM can improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        More Than Just Streets
       </b>
       Do you know everything OSM is capable of mapping? Does your neighbor? Does your mayor? OSM is relatively well known in some circles, but its full potentially is still opaque to many. We want everyone to know what OSM is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Cultivating Leadership of Mappers. Shared Goals Between the Community &amp; OSMF
       </b>
       Mapping is driven by mappers, with a clear goal (make the map!), and theres every reason that with clear goals and empowered members, the OSMF can act strongly. We now have clear goals, and clear expectations of what the management team and working groups can do and achieve, without much prescription on how things happen. This all frees the Board to provide the direction, and the management team and working groups to make the operational decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Easier Contribution for Non-Geeks
       </b>
       We debated how this differed from the Most Used Map, and decided it was important enough focus to stand on its own. Usability is certainly related, but more broadly, theres much to do to improve all kinds of involvement in OSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And Again
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The bulk of our time was spent translating these goals into actions, and this really was the most difficult part. Some things were quick to decide, like the final switch over to ODbL, but others became very drawn out and very detailed, like the process for site redesign. We touched on every standing issue, and aligned clearly to the goals. PR, list moderation, license change, the management team, working group budgets, SOTM, PR, site redesign, the articles of association.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We all agreed that short term action was needed on almost everything, with mind to how things should play out in the longer term. This meant drawing the above diagram, a lot, to remind ourselves of the urgency. We set big, audacious goals for all parts of the Foundation, with clear deadlines.
      </p>

       With so much on the table, we decided to stay in the room until we had decided on everything, which ended up meaning staying hours late, til there was little sunshine outside (or metaphorically sunshine inside the room) and tension rising. At one point, I was so fed up, I almost walked out, really seeing that if we didnt resolve the issue at the Board, it wouldnt resolve in the Foundation and the project, the goals wouldnt be met, and decline was inevitable. And for me personally, that would mean a slow turning away from a project ingrained in almost everything I do in the world. We had to push through.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we did. Despite looking over the brink, we had resolve. I felt tense, but knew Id be happy with what we accomplished.

       Theres good reason to join the excitement about
       <a href="http://opendata.go.ke/">
        Open Data in Kenya
       </a>
       . As
       <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/whats-special-about-open-data-in-kenya">
        Tariq says on the World Bank blog
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Open data in Kenya is special: it comes at a time of national change; its got a head start on tools and expertise from the global open data community and its happening in a country where the information ecosystem is still maturing.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Im proud that our work with Map Kibera has any relation to this at all. And its certainly due to the hard work of passionate people, in a tough environment, especially Dr. Bitange Ndemo (if you have the time,
       <a href="http://www.livestream.com/worldbankafrica/video?clipId=pla_8dc3cbce-cf6e-4345-91bb-ffeda3a2720f&amp;utm_source=lslibrary&amp;utm_medium=ui-thumb">

       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the launch has subsided, and I have a spare moment in the air from Tanzania, I want to look in depth at what data and how data has been released on OpenDataKE, the means of working with the data and collaborating on the data, and how this resource can relate to other open data sets in Kenyan society. Now that the government has made a bold move, I think its the responsibility of the software development community and civil society to really step up and test out the data, and suggest how this can become a really vibrant and social resource. Again, Tariq says this succinctly
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the call for open data should go hand in hand with a call for better quality data: data that might be collected by official government agencies or in this age, by citizens themselves.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       <b>
        Transect across data
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       My method is to hack. I want to make an interesting simple visualization with some data from OpenDataKE, focusing on Nairobi, using openly available tools. Browsing data sets, the
       <a href="https://opendata.go.ke/Population/Vol-1b-Table-1-Constituency-Population-and-Density/2uhj-8n5h">
        Population Density per Constiuency
       </a>
       , derived from the 2009 census, seemed promising. The difference in density across the urban landscape Nairobi is extreme. For a sense of it, just look at the density of features in OpenStreetMap in the
       <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=-1.25856&amp;lon=36.86552&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=M">
        map of the slum of Mathare
       </a>
       compared to nearby
       <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=-1.25337&amp;lon=36.83449&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=M">
        leafy Mathaiga
       </a>
       . And to help the hack, the population density data set even has a handy location column.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe not. The usual practice in tabular data is to split the latitude and longitude into two columns, but here both values are formatted along with the unnecessary name of the province in which the constituency is located. Anyone who has had to work with data is used to little problems like this, and its easy enough (for a programmer) to write a quick script to clean this up. So I selected Export to CSV (side note, the other options presented by the platform seem hardly useful), filtered just the constituencies in Nairobi, and cleaned it up just by hand (I was too lazy to script this for just a handful of values).
      </p>

       <b>
        Gaps and Errors
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       I uploaded the CSV to
       <a href="http://geocommons.com/">
        GeoCommons
       </a>
       , which has facility to deal with many formats of data and easily layer together interactive maps, and was surprised to see that several points werent placed in Nairobi at all. Turns out theres several errors in the location column, at least in Nairobi, and possibly in the rest of the country (I didnt check). Id have to correct these by hand. My knowledge of the location and extent of the constituencies is limited, so I needed another source, and that is not something you can find on OpenDataKE. It took some searching until I found
       <a href="http://constituencies.marsgroupkenya.org/?constID=1&amp;task=about&amp;page=1">
        scanned maps of contituencies on the Mars Group site
       </a>
       . An overview map of all the constituencies was missing, so I used the adjacent constituency names in order to place the mistaken ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       This worked well, but Im left with questions. Why isnt constituency boundary data available on OpenDataKE? How did Mars Group get these maps? And now that Ive gone to the bother of correcting this data set, how can I contribute the changes back, or at least alert the holders of the data to the errors? There is a
       <a href="http://kenya.socrata.com/nominate">
        nomination section on OpenDataKE
       </a>
       , which was wonderfully active until July 9, and then went quiet (did Socratas support contract expire then?). Anyway, Im hopeful these will start getting attention again, so Ive submitted two requests (pending approval to post), one for
       <a>
        constiuency boundaries
       </a>
       , and another for
       <a>
        a way to correct the location column in the population density data set
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       My second surprise was that when I made the annotation size relative to the population density, I didnt see a big difference among the constituencies. The area where Kibera is located, Langata, is about the same density as Westlands, and both are less than CBD and Eastlands. Whats happening here is that constituencies arent aligned to uniform urban settlement patterns. Langata, the home constiuency of the Prime Minister, includes both the slum of Kibera and the wealthy and sparse suburb of Karen. A more useful and telling metric would be population density per Ward, the sub-unit of constituency which does have fairly good alignment to settlement patterns. The census can and has been aggregated to this level, because there was a large promotion of the census count of
       <a href="http://www.mapkibera.org/blog/2010/09/05/kiberas-census-population-politics-precision/">
        population in Kibera
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So again Ive nominated a data set, for the
       <a>
        population density aggregated at ward level
       </a>
       . And Ive also made a request for
       <a>
        meta-information on the methodology of the census in Kibera and other informal settlements
       </a>
       . While the 170,000 figure is surely more close to reality than the wild 1 million figures of the past, by comparing that number with estimates derived from other methods there is a discripency; the others agree on an average closer to 250,000. Additionally, and admittedly anecdotedly, many people in Kibera say they and their neighbors were never counted. Now this happens in any census, and it does not deligitimize the census, but in order to interpret data, openness on the methodology of data collection and analysis is also necessary.

        The Civil Society of Data

      <p>
       Open government data exists in a wider ecosystem. Just a few months ago, Columbia University released amazing
       <a href="http://nairobigismaps.wikischolars.columbia.edu/">
        data sets of Nairobi, including high detail land use
       </a>
       under
       <a href="http://nairobigismaps.wikischolars.columbia.edu/Copyright">
        open knowledge licenses
       </a>
       . A truly beautiful and informative data set. Another place to find many a Kenyan civil society data set is
       <a href="http://www.virtualkenya.org/">
        Virtual Kenya
       </a>
       . I thought the population density dataset would be interesting to layer with land use.
      </p>
      <p>
       This data is distributed as Shapefiles, and I need tiles to use a base map. This is the purpose of
       <a href="http://mapbox.com/">
        MapBox
       </a>
       , a rapidly developing tool set to make it easy to build beautiful map tiles. I loaded the Shapefiles in my locally running
       <a href="http://tilemill.com/">
        TileMill
       </a>
       , styled the landuse categories based on Columbias pdf using carto, assigned interaction, and exported as mbtiles. These were dropboxd, and posted to TileStream, as
       <a href="http://tiles.mapbox.com/groundtruth/#!/map/NairobiLandUse">
        this map
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Mouseover or click on the map to get more detail about each parcel. This interaction technique is really interesting (as a geek), its entirely javascript and lightweight in the browser; it still has a few rough edges, but overall, a nice experience. There are limits, like TileMill doesnt work with CSV, or permit multiple interactive layers, but its a great work in progress. Thanks to DevSeed for the TileStream account, and Dane Springmeyer, who spent some time with me hacking and bug hunting the interaction features of mapnik.

       Like the OpenDataKE data set, and actually all data sets, there are errors  there is no such thing as a perfect map. The
       <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/30210329">
        Ethiopian Church
       </a>
       , across from YaYa, is not indicated nor is its land zoned as public use as other church lands in Nairobi are. And the

        Sarakasi Dome

       <a href="http://www.africayogaproject.org/">

       </a>
       , is not shown a unified plot at all. Now Columbia makes their contact information known on the site, and Ive met them personally, so feedback here is direct over email, but I wonder from here  what is the method and intention to continually correct, update and discuss these data sets? Does it need to?
      </p>

       <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1694" height="328" src="http://brainoff.com/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-22-1024x525.png" title="Screenshot-22" width="640"/>

      <p>
       Of course, that is the primary approach of OpenStreetMap  geographic data in a wiki, that gets constantly examined, updated, and discussed, completely openly. OpenStreetMap can provide another overlay, so we can have some roads and points of reference for the final map. So on GeoCommons, I configured the tiles from the land use data on TileMill (
       <a href="http://developer.geoiq.com/blog/2011/02/01/wms-and-tiles/#comment-498">
        this required some hidden configuration of the tile scheme
       </a>
       ), composited over semi-transparent OSM data (provided by GeoCommons through Acetate), and then finally, the population density points. This is the
       <a href="http://geocommons.com/maps/86214">
        result for now of the data transect
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I can improve this. Youll see that the OSM streets dont overlay precisely with land use. This I believe, but havent confirmed, to be the result of a project error in the Land Use data set. And an even better representation of the population density would have been a geo-join with area boundaries, had they been available. This would clearly show a thematic variation of population density. And of course, finer grained detail will be required to fulfill the original intention to show Nairobis vast differences in population density.

       <b>
        Where have we gone
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Government data sets, authoratative civil society data sets, and completely crowd sourced data sets, layerd together in a single map, revealing a little more about Nairobi, and about the data itself. Each is collected, distributed, and updated in different methods. In some ways, I feel OSM leads the wild edge here of whats possible, and what we want: a truly social environment for data. Data without community is data dry and unimportant. Of course, Im not saying OSM is the final repository for all data: OSM doesnt deal with demographic and private data of a census, and the
       <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/gosm.html">
        methods to authoritatively certify versions of OSM data are just starting
       </a>
       . But this hasnt stopped several kinds of OSM and government interaction already beyond the
       <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import">
        traditional import
       </a>
       , with the likes of
       <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenTripPlanner">

       and the

        USGS
       </a>
       interacting with the OSM community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate promise of all this OpenDataKE is not necessarily in the data itself, but in the deep and wide serving conversations openness triggers. My own personal metric for this will be when government officials from OpenDataKE and slum dwellers from Kibera and Mathare (and
       <a href="http://www.mapkibera.org/blog/2011/08/01/its-time-to-map-mukuru/">

       After 4 weeks, were leaving Jerusalem.  The finest puzzle of human passion, and passion beyond, resting solidly and unsteadily on 5000 years or so of accumulated white stone and dirt. The most complicated and absurd and somehow, sometimes wonderful city. Our host Micha Kurz of Grassroots Jerusalem warned us that 4 weeks would be just enough to just begin understanding Jerusalem. In fact, its only enough time for the city to get a healthy grip on you so that you really dont want to leave. And its definitely not enough time to come up for air for any writing and reflection  hopefully now I have a little space, on my trip back down to Dar es Salaam, the other end from here of the Great Rift Valley, where in complete contrast, the biggest conflict is that there might, maybe, be another political party in a couple years.

       There is a ladder resting on the front balcony of the
       <a href="http://atlasobscura.com/place/immovable-ladder-church-holy-sepulchre">
        Chuch of the Holy Sepluchure
       </a>
       . Centuries of delicate negotiation guide how priests and monks of various sects of Christianity move throughout the twisting bizarre space that might possibly be the site of the crucifixion of Jesus. No set of rules for behavior are comprehensive enough to cover every situation, and you hope you have good faith enough for dialogue when the loopholes come up. Not so here, where no one knows which sect originally placed the ladder, so they all refuse to move it. In the middle of all this, hoards of Russian pilgrims take pouty glamour shots in front of what might possibly be the site of a great suffering of Jesus. Thank you for the absurdity and the warning, that ladder should be the symbol of the city.

       Jerusalem is a place where they play excellent music in the streets on Friday, and no one notices a soldier dancing with a machine gun. In Silwan, down the slopes of the Old City, young men ride horses through streets defiantly kept 2-way as it has been for thousands of years, and gallop against slowly trudging tourist buses making their way to the City of David, where archeological diggings expose Biblical history, and expose too much of the present day, with houses and mosques collapsing above the excavations. Kites flew above all of this, capturing the view from cameras. In one day, you can rave off Jaffa Street, visit the birthplace of Jesus (grottos!), have a lovely fish dinner in the shadow of the security wall (thankfully

And check which beer your drink, cause drinking Taybeh vs Goldstar might be partisan (or wearing your hair a certain way, or the length of your skirt). Weekends are so confusing in Jerusalem! With 3 religions and 3 different holy days, it depends what side of town youre on. Not recommended to go back and forth more than once between East and West Jerusalem in the course of one day, your mind will not be able to take such different worlds living in one city. You can hear Rock the Casbah performed in Arabic, and have multiple two hour discussions on the name of Jerusalem in OpenStreetMap.

       Through it all, there has been such a strong reaffirmation of the mission of GroundTruth. With layers apon layers of history, of too much subtlety of meaning, of confusion, of deadly conflict, seems like the only possible response is coming to some reckoning and witness to it all, to see the change over time, to let everyone speak up about the reality of their lives. Lets map Jerusalem. Lets let people expose their regular humaness, carefully pace ourselves through the bullshit and maybe just find some small piece of reason. On

       , we saw an ancient city transformed yet again at the founding of Israel in 1948, and after 1967, the Green Line is now the smoothest highway through town. The municipal boundary of Jerusalem slices through old villages, envelopes completely new ones, and the security wall takes yet another course, and pressing close is the Areas ABC of the Oslo Accords. It hardly makes sense even if you understand it, and by showing what its like right on a piece of ground you may never visit otherwise, perhaps finally some understanding will happen.

       a small and inspiring village, which has a piece of just about everything complicated in Israel and Palestine including a completely encircling section of the wall, and its all being wrapped up in a potent brew of technology and training inspired by a slum in East Africa.

       The past few months have most entirely been about discussing, strategizing, arguing, planning. Really missing actually doing stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I decided to ignore the emails, concepts notes, budgets, design documents. Build something. Just small things, but cool things. Makes me happy.

       On the OpenStreetMap site, the

       is super important for keeping tabs on changes, but visually dull and hard to immediately parse. I added a map, with highlighting between the list and map views.
       <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/TomH">
        TomH
       </a>
       cleaned up the code and improved the layout. Basically,
       <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/commit/48929e8781f9c136a142400a7a2ef1cf994f74fd">
        just some javascript and view changes
       </a>
       , and I had to get my OSM installation up to date. Needs some tweaking, but a good start.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pushed to do this by the
       <a href="http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Working_Group_Minutes/SWG_2011-04-29">
        Strategic Working Group
       </a>
       . Were discussing the OSM front page and usability, going in circles, and realzing the only way forward was to just do some things, however minor, to iterate our discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the history tab, I realize theres many ways to go in the realm of monitoring change. Make monitoring more interactive, customized to the places your care about, and the mappers you trust. There are a whole set of
       <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance#Monitoring_Tools">
        external monitoring tools
       </a>
       and perhaps some of the tools, or the ideas, could be integrated.

      <p>
       Last year in Nairobi, I became aware of an amazing
       <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/33361176/Aagw2010-June-10-Paolo-Paron-Access-Hapa">
        archive of historic aerial imagery
       </a>
       , flown by the RAF, acquired over all the British Colonial possessions, several times over decades. The images were used for creating ordnance survey maps  but since then the original images have been sitting in various dusty basements, most recently Oxford. Paolo Paron has a plan to get it all openly online. But in the mean time, you have to go to Oxford, sort through boxes of square images, and request photographic copies. I had the chance to do this back in December, and it was wonderful. 1961 is 50 years ago, meaning these images are out of copyright!
      </p>
      <p>
       I receieved from Oxford eight largish tiff images. Seeking first to rectify them, I tried various incarnations of
       <a href="http://mapwarper.net/">
        map warper
       </a>
       (including a local version) but with 30 MB images, it was choking. Next I tried to find a desktop option, and found good results with
       <a href="http://qgis.org/">
        QGIS
       </a>
       georectification plugin. I stitched together 6 of the images, roughly (if I spent more time, wouldve adjusted the different brightness levels and try to align better the two North-South runs that covered Nairobi, one at a slight angle to another). Then loaded a shapefile of Kenya OSM into QGIS, set control points, and warped. Took the resulting GeoTiff onto the generous resource of
       <a href="http://cube.telascience.org/">
        hypercube
       </a>
       , warped the image to spherical mercator using gdalwarp, and after some hints from winkey and crschmidt on #telascience, gdal_translate -expand rgb, to take this single band image into RGB, which TileLayers seems to prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres a lot more to say about this image, and thatll be built up in the upcoming new mapkibera.org site. And of course, theres those 1.5 million time capsule images sitting in an Oxford basement to open up.

       Friends of my mine from Nairobi, working for the World Bank, undertook a substantial data collection of all water distribution points in Liberia. Pretty interesting compare and contrast with community mapping. I was pinged about this on twitter by Ned of Water for People, who helped develop the Android/Appspot application for this data collection, called
       <a href="http://www.mobileactive.org/flow-where-mobile-tech-and-water-meet">
        FLOW
       </a>
       . My immediate response was that this should be open source and open data, so other people can do cool stuff with it.
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mikel.maron/posts/879075099358">
        Max took up the conversation and obliged
       </a>
       (as much as he could, the data license is still under discussion). So I had to respond and
       <a href="http://rockburger.com/flowliberia/">
        do something cool with the data
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://flowliberia.appspot.com/">
        flow web app
       </a>
       is ok, but a little clunky. It uses the Google Maps API, and with nearly 1000 markers, it loads slowly and interaction is tricky. So I wanted to try a
       <i>
        tile-based approach
       </i>
       , to improve the speed and visualization, and this seemed like the best opportunity to get into
       <a href="http://tilemill.com/">
        TileMill
       </a>
       , part of the
       <a href="http://mapbox.com/">
        MapBox toolset by Development Seed
       </a>
       . After going through the tools, I am extremely impressed with what DevSeed is building, and hope I can help out by finding good uses, digging up bugs, and contributing here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I installed TileMill, updating mapnik in the process. Really nicely designed app, with laser focus on building nice tiles. One of the amazing features is
       <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/developmentseed/5640168265/in/photostream/">
        map interactivity
       </a>
       , which easily and efficiently turns input data sets into mouseover and infowindow bubbles. The trick it uses is
       <a href="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/MapnikRenderers#grid_renderer">
        grid renderer
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/springmeyer">
        Danes
       </a>
       extension to mapnik which builds tiled json files, used by the
       <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/wax">
        wax library
       </a>
       for OpenLayers (and ModestMaps, and GMaps) to define hit areas. Basically, much more efficient than creating markers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Dane showed me
       <a href="https://github.com/springmeyer/gridsforkids">
        gridsforkids
       </a>
       , a simple sandbox for building image and json tile sets for standalone, offline map apps. I had to grab the .mml file created by TileMill, have carto convert that to mapnik xml, and then use the custom generate_tiles.py to build everything. Found a small bug in how TMS is handled there, and had to hack in a few things for my data set, but it basically works (a few problems with the hit areas, still investigating). One way this could go is streamlining the process, where one of the outputs from TileMill was a tar ball bundling all the tools to run the map offline.
