        I dont believe in God. However, I do believe in divine retribution. Without 
  going into the specifics of this somewhat counterintuitive theology, suffice 
  to say here that its central axiom is the idea that actions have consequences. 
  One cannot go on committing evil without reaping a whirlwind or two. Eventually

        </a>
        by Steve Chapman, a mildly conservative journalist with vaguely libertarian leanings: according to him, people on the right (of which I count myself one) are "addicted to apocalypse." He takes us through decades of conservative apocalyptic rhetoric, from Ronald Reagan

        of the moment  who recently said:
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         The challenges facing this country are unlike any we have ever seen.  
  (T)his is an administration that seems bound and determined to violate every 
  single one of our Bill of Rights. Were nearing the edge of a cliff.  We 
  have a couple of years to turn this country around, or we go off the cliff to 
  oblivion. Citing Reagan, Cruz declared: One day we will find ourselves answering 
  questions from our children and our childrens children, What was it like when 
  America was free?'
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Chapman, whose likeness accompanying his column shows him smiling the smile of the self-satisfied bourgeois, this is all so much balderdash, because, you see, Reagan was wrong: Medicare
        <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-5414390.html">
         wasnt that bad
        </a>

        <a href="http://geology.com/world/the-united-states-of-america-map.gif">
         where I live

        , but whatever), and the Soviet Union faded away (well, yes, just as the apocalyptic Ludwig von Mises
        <a href="http://mises.org/econcalc.asp">
         predicted
        </a>
        ). See? Nothing to fear! Good times are ahead! The world is our oyster!
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem with those grumpy old conservatives, says Chapman, is that "when their dire predictions fail to come true, they keep forecasting the worst possible outcome if they dont get their way. They seem to need the perpetual excitement of impending doom."
       </p>
       <p>
        The smugness of our political class is impenetrable: they believe the system 
  that sustains and rewards them is invulnerable, or nearly so. The society in 
  which they live is, seemingly, a well-ordered one, where  in spite of a few 
  glitches, like
        <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/08/ex_gop_insider_unloads_blame_neo_confederate_insurrectionists_for_shutdown/">

  elements  the machinery of society runs smoothly, interrupted only by occasional 
  burps and hiccups
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet just beneath the surface, there is a roiling, like some giant serpent crawling 
  mere inches below the cool green grass, making odd curlicues in an otherwise 
  perfect lawn: a message written in an alien cursive, signifying  what?

        One could make the case that a self-conscious evil, the sort that revels in its moral inversion and loudly proclaims its transgressive nature at least has the virtue of honesty about it. But thats not our style: we kill because were

        and Freedom and against Intolerance and Sheer Badness. And we believe our own lies, if only because of that warm toasty feeling we get when we repeat them, like hot chocolate quaffed in front of a fireplace on Christmas Eve.

        The lies we tell ourselves insulate us from the

        I wont deliver a long lecture here on basic economics: theres no room  and, 
  really, no need. Because any ordinary person can see what is wrong with this 
  picture: one cannot consume more than one produces. The average American used 
  to understand this: the American political class, on the other hand, has always 
  had its own arithmetic, one founded on the very same "exceptionalist" 
  doctrine that has steered our foreign policy on its present mad course. Bound 
  by no law but that which they legislate, Washingtons reckless hubris defies 
  the laws of nature and the gods themselves. In short: theyre begging for that 
  lightning bolt, as did Icarus  and

            i've read that the act of being able to delude oneself is essential to survival.  on some level this clearly makes sense but i'm wondering in the case of america if this instinct (self delusion) has gone way too far??  how an entire nation of people can so blindly put their heads in the sand (or up their you know whats) i find incredulous and at times intellectually overwhelming.  it's as if they have a total aversion to truth and reality.  consequences?!? i must have made up a word that doesn't exist.  to my mind there is no excuse for such lazy, willful ignorance.  and yeh, at some point you have to pay the price for being so stupid in life.  might and luck can only take you so far, but as justin points out the economics (and i don't mean just money) of the universe even out.

            and as far as iraq and the numbers dead, the lancet put the numbers CONSERVATIVELY at 500K 10 years ago.  most now count over a million killed with another 4-5 million having fled the country.  so in a nation of 23 million in 2003 you're looking at roughly 20% of the population killed or displaced. i think that counts as a genocide no?  keep up the great work america. you have a lot to be proud of.

            The bigger they are the harder they fall. I don't think Chapman is talking to non-interventionist. He is talking to Republicans. They had their chance with Ron Paul but they picked someone much closer to Obama both times. Chapman is reminding them that they would love Obama if he was a Republican because he is continuing their beloved policies. Ron Paul put forth a real right wing plan to repair our society and what Chapman calls the right has not. What they are doing is engaging in histrionics without any desire to change the status quo because "the squeaky wheel gets the oil." These are some of the people that favored American policy on Iraq and wish to bring the same gruesome end to Iran.

            there is not divine retribution or "justice". people will simply continue to get away with whatever they can get away with for as long as they can, and then they take their lumps. same story, repeated over and over, writ small or large  whether its an arrogant, asshole millionaire or some sociopathic thug on a streetcorner, do they ever actually pay in proportion to their crimes and the people they hurt? of the grandees who run DC or the other capitals of the world, how many will meet the fate of saddam or ghadafi? most die in their beds, and are accorded the kind of reverence in death that makes the idea of justice seem absurd. still, good column from JR.

            Doesn't the ignorance of the average US citizen stem from the breakdown of the family and the complete failure of the US public school system, where our youth are not taught to question and small children are indoctrinated beginning in kindergarten?  Doesn't the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance reinforce that?  Kids know all about how to use the latest techno gadget, but how many can find Iraq on a map?

            Action  and inaction  do have consequences.  Among others Confucius taught that long ago  and not consequences in the "next world" but in this one.
            <br/>
            Right now, for example, there is no large peace organization in this country.  There are only so-called "peace and justice" organizations which have a very limited appeal beyond the sanctimonious politically correct who insist that all antiwarriors share their sense of "justice" or get lost.  The failure to build such an organization is inaction and it will have tragic consequences  worse than what we have seen in Iraq- and consequences for all the world when the time comes.  It is not just the US ruling elite who will be to blame but all of us for failing to curb that elite and end their tyranny.

            Ted Cruz, whom Justin alluded to, is the latest darling of the Tea Party right and enemy of the "mainstream."  Is Cruz another Reagan, only smarter?  Let's not forget that Reagan dramatically increased both the military budget and the national debt.  Most self-avowed fiscally conservatives GOP insurgents seem to have a blind spot when it comes to foreign policy.  There is no way to even put much of a dent in the deficit without major cuts to the military budget/NSA/Homeland Security, etc.  The Tea Party's emphasis is all about objection to government run health care, but, many are affluent white seniors  don't dare touch their Medicare!  I have not yet heard Cruz expound on much beyond his obsession to stop Obamacare and all that Obama stands for.  If he turns out to be just another neocon on foreign policy then he is a worthless phony.

            The reason that so many Americans think that America is "exceptional" is because they also believe that they themselves are "exceptional". Certainly the financial "wizards" on Wall Street think that they are "exceptional" -too "exceptional" to have to pay taxes. The US military considers itself "exceptional"  exceptionally  endowed by the gods to mete out harm on anyone who gets in their way. Even the lowest pleb on SSI  thinks that he is "exceptional" in that he deserves a perpetual levy because he cannot or will not compete and therefore considers himself to be "disabled".

            Nearly 45,000 people die in the United States each year  one every 12 minutes  in large part because they lack health insurance and can not get good care, Harvard Medical School researchers, Reuters reported.

            As much as the world owes Justin for his brilliant war and civil liberties reporting and analysis, I would prefer that he post his economic thoughts on Lew Rockwell or another forum, where Libertarian economics would not polarize a potential antiwar, anti-police-state coalition.

            wellllllllll that's a theory i guess. personally and with respects i don't really buy it. i was raised in a one parent household and managed to get myself edu-macated. as for the schools, there is some truth to the fact that schools are just places for behavior conditioning as opposed to developing critical thinking. to my mind america has developed an attitude where being smart or informed about things is a liability.  we simply don't respect intelligence. we love a greedy f*ck with a lot of money and equate this with being smart, but generally the exact opposite is true.

            Libertarian economics, if defined as a stateless society, is the foundation of the antiwar, anti-police state coalition. The principles of Liberty are a total package. Do not try to subdivide them in the name of benevolence.

            Solid evidence that even the recent phony "government shut down" was the right tactic: virtually every political commentator with statist leanings (namely, almost all) were highly indignant, vocal and outraged that their God the State could be so insulted by such behavior. A wall of opposition and warnings that economic catastrophe would ensue. Nonsense of course, but this shows the depth of "journalistic" love of the federal government. There were a few exceptions to this wail of complaint, but not many.
            <br/>
            The Dogs of Statism howled as one. The Pack responded to the call. Hence, it was clearly the right thing to do. So it should be done again and again, each time gaining more popular favor as dire warnings of doom are proven to be false and pure self interest. A useful signal for correct tactical politics.

            Well if that comatose pawn of the Annenbergs is Ted Cruz's hero(Reagan)we is in a whole lotta trouble.And the fixation on Abe Lincoln,with the cries of thug and terrorist,leave me to wonder if  sane people think America wasn't worth keeping whole,and forgetting the actual fact that the south initiated the whole shebang,and that Lincoln burned no cities personally,and his actual stance was that these slavery problems could be worked out peacefully,but southern extremists thought otherwise.And what the hell is wrong with Medicare,and especially for all,to take back our healthcare from rapacious monsters?Ideologist narrow thinking is limiting,sorry.

            I'm waiting for the American nationalist of the caliber of Putin who will take back our nation from international Zionism and greed,bring back our jobs,and deliver US from the idiotic and stupid War of Terror,War on Drugs,the totally useless War on Poverty,and now the new War on Weather.Cruz and Rand don't seem likely as those deliverers from evil, who knows exactly where they stand,but as the fifth column MSM hates them,maybe they are a step in the right direction.

            what good is it to un-enslave the militarily weaker world by repudiating political imperialism while then enslaving one's own people through socialistic economic imperialism.  Liberty must come as a package deal wherein actions and consequences are allowed to be so close that they work w/ each other in real time.  This insults the imperialistic/superioristic and greedy mindset, but defeats force and corruption.

            I think we turned a corner when, after 9/11, we began to embrace the sense that we were victims, more sinned against than sinning. We winced at talk of civilian deaths as a result of our aggression. Perhaps we could call them victims too  of al-Qaeda, of their backward Islam, poor things. Not of our attacks. Not as a result of them. So we just don't go on moral crusades anymore to uncover our misdeeds. We arm rebels wherever and for a moment celebrate their death squads, then perhaps yank the rug out from under them eventually, only to be hit somewhere somehow by their pathetic attempts at blowback.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the long-range effect of all this is quite visible. It is in our refusal to call things by their proper names, our refusal to see and to think about our responsibility. Attacking worthy opponents in wars we regarded as noble was one thing. This is a sordid something else. And we are coming at it from the position that they made us do it, because we were attacked in the Homeland. The metamorphosis is indeed very ugly.

            In "Shock Doctrine," Naomi Klein has presented many examples of the government violence needed to impose Libertarianism upon resistant populations and Libertarianism's disastrous consequences in those countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1848, Brussels hosted the first free trade conference. The event drew classical liberals and a written presentation from Karl Marx. Together, those economic-deterministics embraced the same libertarian free-trade, open-borders policies. While sharing the same policies, libertarians and Marx had different motives and expectations. Unlike the libertarians, Marx correctly predicted that libertarianism would destroy the middle class economy and culture. Whatever their delusions, today's Libertarians still support Marx's no-regulatory, free-trade policies, no matter how deadly the consequences have been to Latin and South American people or to deceased American patients and their survivors.

           <p>
            That's why Ron Paul was wise to offer to temporarily compromise on government health insurance spending in his last presidential primary campaign and, in part, why influential liberal Glenn Greenwald could promote Ron's antiwar and civil liberty positions without having to rip the pro-life gynecologist for favoring deadly private health insurance.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Justin continues to advocate Libertarian economics in antiwar.com instead of in LewRockwell.com, I do not see how this site can remain credible to liberals and others who don't distinguish between killing tens of thousands of people a year by war or by private health insurance, which arguably allows 45,000 Americans a year to suffer a discarded dog's death to uphold a Libertarian delusion.

            There are sprees that people go on and while the fit is on them, they refuse to account for what is happening  be they financial, sexual, military  but the mind-set they were in had some costs, because not only are there debts, there are also opportunity costs, missed opportunities. In dysfunctional settings where this stuff is ongoing, like this country during our war fevers, questions are left unasked not to speak of unanswered. Connecting dots is easy  why that is how they created constellations, which really have no scientific basis. They are just perceptions from one perspective and with human wishes projected on. No, deeper analysis is harder to reduce to bullet points. But in a society which prefers to be dotty, anything goes and we are led by the nose.

            It's the kind of society we have made by our recent deeds rather than even the body count that says who we are.

            I remember that during Bush, an Italian tried to calm my indignation by saying that my country was an adolescent, making all the rookie mistakes (on a grand scale). If we think about that, we can see that older societies are not as gullible or as driven, for good or for ill. Even Mussolini did not shake up Italy for long. There's a lot of inertia from the age of some of them, but I suppose that (if I were not Amanda Knox) I might well prefer Tuscany (or almost anywhere else on earth) to a place like Midland-Odessa, Texas (for instance).

            Between WW2 &amp; 1999, an estimated 50,000,000 human lives were lost in armed conflicts. To speak on your "Since the end of World War II, the United States has murdered so many innocent people that the numbers approach Hitlerian dimensions.", the US, your parents &amp; grandparents &amp; kids (in many cases), were responsible for 20-30 million of those. Not to mention started the new millennia with an easy 1-2 million. That's not even counting Pinnochet, Idi Amin, Saddam, the Shah, Indonesia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, etc. So, to me, a bartender in Hollywood, California, we have far out done Hitler. Look at cancer rates from 78-2013, and the real depravity of American society is revealed, absent divine anything. I get the article's point, and I agree in principle, I just see the horrific brutality that is the root cause, as just a 'lil' bit more intense than "approaching" the likes of Hitler. To me: cancer deaths are the 'fire' &amp; heart disease is the 'brimstone'; soldier suicides are those crazy scorpion wasps. It's all just one big suicide pact. That's real divine justice, make them wipe themselves away like Canaanites. Go team, go!

            I am 35 (1978). In my lifetime the US cancer rate went from 1/16 (6.25%) up to 1/4 (25%). In 78 that meant 13,000,000 today it means 92,000,000. [I got this data from reports on studies monitoring the effects of radiation exposure on cells from 1982-2006. Every report concluded the radiation from THE Nuclear Industry, actually benefit human health and help "reduce cancer risks"] plus, 870,000 Americans  die from 'heart disease', and even according to AMA, 80% of those are identified as "preventable" (suicidal tendencies?). So, Americans kill FAR more of each other than non-Americans, or non-whites in general, EVERY YEAR. To me, I smell divinity in that. Isn't that what gods are for, anyway?

            Whatever Chapman says, he ultimately serves the socialist agenda. He is a "safe" right-winger who follows two steps behind the Left in every issue, and attacks all REAL opposition as "extremist", that catch-all word.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reagan, von Mises and also Cruz are right, we have gone steadily downhill. The Left's control of the mass media doesn't allow any dissent against its anti-Western agenda. Debate about important issues is far less free today than in Reagan's time.
           </p>

            Chappy's job is to keep enough people confused long enough that Americans won't organize to resist. Once Americans become a minority in their own country the media elite and their lackeys figure Americans are no longer a threat, and the establishment can drop its mask completely.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are wrong, of course. Americans, once organized, can win even if they are only a third of the population or less. Chappy and the other lackeys will find that out the hard way.

            [] The smugness of our political class is impenetrable: they believe the system that sustains and rewards them is invulnerable, or nearly so. The society in which they live is, seemingly, a well-ordered one, where  in spite of a few glitches, like government shutdowns caused by evil nihilists and other subversive elements  the machinery of society runs smoothly, interrupted only by occasional burps and hiccups. Yet just beneath the surface, there is a roiling, like some giant serpent crawling mere inches below the cool green grass, making odd curlicues in an otherwise perfect lawn: a message written in an alien cursive, signifying  what?

            We are getting there  mad that is. Did not even know what 'twerking' was until the regular media kept talking about it. People are wiggling their butts with dogs and stick out their tongues and some call it humor.

           <p>
            While half of the population gets mad with twerking the other half is mad with being engaged in wars and killings by drones.

            If one jumps off a cliff, gravity may well kill him. This is part of Natural Law. It is not necessarily a sin to jump off a cliff. If you die, Nature is not punishing you for the evil that you do. This is simply a contingency built into that mechanism. Nature, or Natural Law could dictate into our minds not to jump off the cliff. If we choose to jump off the cliff, then in respect we are disobeying Natural Law. To some, one is also disobeying the "Giver" of that Law. There is the saying, "The wages of sin is death."
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to start a theology debate here. We humans on planet earth (and possibly elsewhere) live in a system of "civil religion" whether one acknowledges that or not. This is not a sectarian faith. All of our founders, including the deists confirmed this. Disobedience to Natural Law does have its consequences. At times, grave ones.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we are seeing today materializing before our very eyes is the final stages of the Enlightenment. ~300 years of it. Even Ben Franklin said it was experimental at best. Now we know. If we get the chance do it again, then we better do right this time around.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without getting too theological here, there is a theological problem here as concerns this nation. It is on multiple levels. It is most complex. I don't know if it is solvable even given a second chance. The funny thing, is that the founders recognized it. The big ones, Madison and Jefferson in particular. Locke and even Milton recognized it. It has to do with proper dissemination of Church and State. That is the key to solving this puzzle. I'm not sure it is doable, as federalism proved to be a most fragile system that we apparently could not maintain.

            If any here wish to amplify for themselves further, then may I suggest the study "From Sea to Shining Sea." It is available free on itunes presented by Joel Biermann. Most will not be disappointed. Justin, especially you. Perhaps you can solve for yourself your living oxymoron.

            The Golden Dawn Party in Greece had the right idea to attack those very things and take back their country for Greeks. It is now the third most popular party in that country and look at how frightened the zionist-owned Greek government is of them, arresting GD's leader, Nikos Michaloliakos and others, claiming they are part of a criminal organization when it's the government that is criminal. We need something like Golden Dawn in the US, the Demicans and Republicrats are two wings of the same bird that is crapping all over us and need to sent to the trash heap of history.

            I agree with your analysis that statism is the disease.  However, given the media's overwhelming influence, and the fact that Obama and Reid refuse to negotiate, the GOP may pay dearly if it shuts things down again before the next election.  It could spell their doom.

            I think you raise some good points, but I must dismiss the bulk of it.  There is now an agenda at work that did not exist 6 years ago which is why Antiwar.com is no longer one of my bookmarks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The perverse advertisements you allow on the site tell me you sold out long ago.  You were good once, but now, not so much.  Pushing Filipino Cupid.com and 'Male Gamers Only' for me is disgusting.

            Justin rightly has faith in just consequences in response to and in payment for the evil of mankind. I agree even if it is because I do believe that God has written such eternal truths in nature and written them in such a large and bold font that no man can deny the knowledge if it. While in this cursed creation we do not see all accounts brought to balance we see enough to know beyond doubt that there is an accounting for evil committed. Justice is as sure as the nature of water to seek its own level; man can imagine himself its master but it is truly water raj masters man. God is neither deaf nor blind.  He acts on his own time despite our desire to dictate a timing we would see as more right or holy. History is replete with examples of the man filled with hubris brought low.

            I dont believe in God. However, I do believe in divine retribution Eventually Nemesis overtakes Hubris, and the results arent pretty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Justin doesnt believe in a Creator-Person who ultimately destroys evil. In other words, he doesnt believe in the Bibles retrograde God who will, as the KJV puts it, reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished (2 Peter 2:9).
           </p>
           <p>
            That leaves Justin with nothing but a Greco-mythic Comeuppance delivered by the god he _does_ believe in  an Evolution-induced, Nature-driven outworking of divine retribution that eventually comes around to settle accounts. Theres no certainty built into this contraption. In fact, theres nothing remotely personal in it. God-less nations, like America, all become cesspools of unspeakable depravity. The results arent pretty because humanity has elected to endure the ravages of the Great Natural Selectionwhich couldnt give a fiddlers bonk about hominid justice.
           </p>

            Psalms 53:1: The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
