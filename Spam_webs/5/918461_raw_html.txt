      Hi,
      <br/>
      I will soon be ordering a Kress kiln and am very new to this art. We live in
      <br/>
      Hawaii and and the cost of electricity is very high. Is it possible to run
      <br/>
      it off of say a 13000 KW generator?  My husband seems to think it would
      <br/>
      work. Any help on this subject would be greatly appreciated. I cannot go gas
      <br/>
      as way beyond my means so am stuck with electric.
      <br/>

      Thanks for any help, Aloha,

      If your generator puts out 13KW (which is what I think you meant, rather
      <br/>
      than "13000 KW" = 13 Megawatts), at 240 volts, you can run a kiln as
      <br/>
      large as 50 Amps. The generator needs to be rated 13 KW "continuous",
      <br/>
      not "peak" or "max".

      HI John,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Thanks very much. This was really informative. I have been against the
      <br/>
      generator idea ( secretly think my husband just wants a bigger gen than he
      <br/>
      has now) and do not think with the amount of firing I shall do- maybe once a
      <br/>
      month that it shall be prohibitive. They are flexible with fires here-
      <br/>
      people still burn trash in barrels though I don't. The tradewinds keep the
      <br/>
      air super clean but I figure that pollution has to be going somewhere so
      <br/>
      just want to not add any for any other people.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I shall print out all advise I get and go from there. The cost to ship over
      <br/>
      is gonna kill me but getting a used one here on the Island is like finding
      <br/>
      gold. Wood expensive unless we use the trees around that are like balsa
      <br/>
      which burn up in 2 secs. I intend to ask my brother about the home made gas
      <br/>
      kiln though as might be feasible. I am interested in functional so that
      <br/>
      makes me require more also.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Again thanks much. I envy you Alaska- well someday I shall see it
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Have a great one and thanks for your time,
      <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        &gt; Carol, I understand about the price of energy  to run kilns being
        <br/>
        &gt; expensive. I lived in Alaska for a long time, and as with Hiwaii, the
        <br/>
        &gt; further out in the bush one went, the more expensive everything got.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; As to energy for the kiln, you really need to look at the various
        <br/>
        &gt; options and consider the long and short of it.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Electricity: I'm sure  it is locally available, everyone has it to one
        <br/>
        &gt; degree or another, and it is readily, though expensively available to
        <br/>
        &gt; run a kiln. No muss, no fuss or at least minimally so in getting an
        <br/>
        &gt; electric kiln hooked up and ready to go.Requires you to buy a kiln on
        <br/>
        &gt; the mainland, have it shipped, all relatively expensive - Kiln plus
        <br/>
        &gt; shipping, plus hook up.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Gas: I don't know about natural or propane gas there, but expensive I
        <br/>
        &gt; would expect as compared to electricity. But would burn clean, minimum
        <br/>
        &gt; fuss. If you were inovative, I would bet you could build a small gas
        <br/>
        &gt; kiln for less than it would cost you to import an electric kiln. Then
        <br/>
        &gt; you would only need to be concerned about gas costs. You would not need
        <br/>
        &gt; to be concerned about electrical outages disrupting a firing - unless
        <br/>
        &gt; you have used electricity some way in the operation of the gas kiln.  Of
        <br/>
        &gt; course local ordinances may have a negative impact. But I would
        <br/>
        &gt; certainly look into the real cost of gas vs electricity.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Home Owner Generator Electricity - A generator capable of production of
        <br/>
        &gt; power to supply 12500 Watts of power - 240 volts at 50-60 amps for 12
        <br/>
        &gt; hours is going to be one expensive puppy  to purchase. Then there is the
        <br/>
        &gt; cost of maintenance on it. Then there is the cost of the gas to run it
        <br/>
        &gt; and that to will be a very expensive issue in Hiwaii.  If you get a
        <br/>
        &gt; diesel fuel generator, the purchase cost will go up again but hourly
        <br/>
        &gt; operating cost will be lower. . In Alaska many people living in remote
        <br/>
        &gt; locations used one-lungers as they were called - one cylinder diesel
        <br/>
        &gt; generators -the Witte Generator was a popular brand. Pricey though but
        <br/>
        &gt; more efficient over all, and very dependable,  than gas because the same
        <br/>
        &gt; fuel could be used to heat your house, and cook with, and heat your hot
        <br/>
        &gt; water. Less of a fire hazard than gas. Easier to transport because of
        <br/>
        &gt; the reduced fire hazard.

        &gt; Wood: Local woods might be available if you check around, so a wood fire
        <br/>
        &gt; kiln might be an option, although I expect there useable wood would be
        <br/>
        &gt; very scarce.. Then there may be environmental concerns as well as code
        <br/>
        &gt; limitations.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Coal: Prol'ly out of the question
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; But I would certainly look into the real cost of gas vs electricity.
        <br/>
        &gt; Unless you are in a location where some other fuel is convienently and
        <br/>
        &gt; inexpensively available electricity is probably going to be the cheapest
        <br/>
        &gt; energy available to you, regardless. In Alaska, in certain areas along
        <br/>
        &gt; the coast, there is coal sticking up out of the ground and sand. It's
        <br/>
        &gt; low grade, but it burns, and anyone with the will can go to the beaches
        <br/>
        &gt; ansimply load theirs truck with it, come home and burn it in their
        <br/>
        &gt; stove, kiln or what have you. That is about as cheap as it gets. But for
        <br/>
        &gt; most of us any where in the country, even Hiwaii, and even as expensive
        <br/>
        &gt; as it is there, electricity is going to be the cheapest energy  going.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Good luck on your quest to get up and running on firing.

      Thanks Roger, I am sure I made a mistake with the 13000. Now just need to
      <br/>
      see if I can find kiln falling into correct range and the continuous. Really
      <br/>
      needed this info- appreciate it.

        &gt; If your generator puts out 13KW (which is what I think you meant, rather
        <br/>
        &gt; than "13000 KW" = 13 Megawatts), at 240 volts, you can run a kiln as
        <br/>
        &gt; large as 50 Amps. The generator needs to be rated 13 KW "continuous",
        <br/>
        &gt; not "peak" or "max".

      Carol, I understand about the price of energy  to run kilns being
      <br/>
      expensive. I lived in Alaska for a long time, and as with Hiwaii, the
      <br/>
      further out in the bush one went, the more expensive everything got.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As to energy for the kiln, you really need to look at the various
      <br/>
      options and consider the long and short of it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Electricity: I'm sure  it is locally available, everyone has it to one
      <br/>
      degree or another, and it is readily, though expensively available to
      <br/>
      run a kiln. No muss, no fuss or at least minimally so in getting an
      <br/>
      electric kiln hooked up and ready to go.Requires you to buy a kiln on
      <br/>
      the mainland, have it shipped, all relatively expensive - Kiln plus
      <br/>
      shipping, plus hook up.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Gas: I don't know about natural or propane gas there, but expensive I
      <br/>
      would expect as compared to electricity. But would burn clean, minimum
      <br/>
      fuss. If you were inovative, I would bet you could build a small gas
      <br/>
      kiln for less than it would cost you to import an electric kiln. Then
      <br/>
      you would only need to be concerned about gas costs. You would not need
      <br/>
      to be concerned about electrical outages disrupting a firing - unless
      <br/>
      you have used electricity some way in the operation of the gas kiln.  Of
      <br/>
      course local ordinances may have a negative impact. But I would
      <br/>
      certainly look into the real cost of gas vs electricity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Home Owner Generator Electricity - A generator capable of production of
      <br/>
      power to supply 12500 Watts of power - 240 volts at 50-60 amps for 12
      <br/>
      hours is going to be one expensive puppy  to purchase. Then there is the
      <br/>
      cost of maintenance on it. Then there is the cost of the gas to run it
      <br/>
      and that to will be a very expensive issue in Hiwaii.  If you get a
      <br/>
      diesel fuel generator, the purchase cost will go up again but hourly
      <br/>
      operating cost will be lower. . In Alaska many people living in remote
      <br/>
      locations used one-lungers as they were called - one cylinder diesel
      <br/>
      generators -the Witte Generator was a popular brand. Pricey though but
      <br/>
      more efficient over all, and very dependable,  than gas because the same
      <br/>
      fuel could be used to heat your house, and cook with, and heat your hot
      <br/>
      water. Less of a fire hazard than gas. Easier to transport because of
      <br/>
      the reduced fire hazard.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Wood: Local woods might be available if you check around, so a wood fire
      <br/>
      kiln might be an option, although I expect there useable wood would be
      <br/>
      very scarce.. Then there may be environmental concerns as well as code
      <br/>
      limitations.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coal: Prol'ly out of the question
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But I would certainly look into the real cost of gas vs electricity.
      <br/>
      Unless you are in a location where some other fuel is convienently and
      <br/>
      inexpensively available electricity is probably going to be the cheapest
      <br/>
      energy available to you, regardless. In Alaska, in certain areas along
      <br/>
      the coast, there is coal sticking up out of the ground and sand. It's
      <br/>
      low grade, but it burns, and anyone with the will can go to the beaches
      <br/>
      ansimply load theirs truck with it, come home and burn it in their
      <br/>
      stove, kiln or what have you. That is about as cheap as it gets. But for
      <br/>
      most of us any where in the country, even Hiwaii, and even as expensive
      <br/>
      as it is there, electricity is going to be the cheapest energy  going.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Good luck on your quest to get up and running on firing.
      <br/>

      &gt;&gt;Hi,
      <br/>
      &gt;&gt;I will soon be ordering a Kress kiln and am very new to this art. We live in
      <br/>
      &gt;&gt;Hawaii and and the cost of electricity is very high. Is it possible to run
      <br/>
      &gt;&gt;it off of say a 13000 KW generator?  My husband seems to think it would
      <br/>
      &gt;&gt;work. Any help on this subject would be greatly appreciated. I cannot go gas
      <br/>
      &gt;&gt;as way beyond my means so am stuck with electric.

      Don't do it. Go propane fueled gas kiln. Or use electricity off the line.

      Here's why: A gasoline powered generator is about 15% efficient. Nearly 85%

      of the gasoline is wasted. A diesel generator can be over 20% efficient, but
      <br/>
      even then, 80% of the fuel is still wasted. By contrast, a gas fired kiln

      converts the fuel directly to heat which then does the firing. Even

      electricity off the grid would likely be cheaper than electricity you make
      <br/>
      with a generator. Now add to this the cost of the purchase and maintenance
      <br/>
      of the generator and you will find it to be more expensive than line power.

      boring but necessary calcs:
      <br/>
      13000 watts= 13 kw. Here, it costs 0.07/kw . Assume you run on high for 10
      <br/>
      hours: in Idaho it costs 10 hours/load  x 13kw/hr x $0.07/kw= $9.10 per
      <br/>
      load. If your electricity is 4 times more  ($0.28/kw hour), you would spend
      <br/>
      $36.40 per load ($9.10 x 4 = $36.40).
      <br/>
      Now consider the generator. Cost? Great Plains lists a 15 kw generator at
      <br/>
      $3104. Add in delivery and get say $3500.  at full load, 13kw continuous, it
      <br/>
      uses 2.5 gallons per hour. If gas costs $1.60 per gallon, that hour will
      <br/>
      cost you $1.60 x 2.5 = $4.00. From this we see that  off the grid break even
      <br/>
      is $4.00/ 13kw = $0.308/kw hour.
      <br/>
      NOW, figure you run 100 loads for pay off of the generator. Pay off requires
      <br/>
      allocation of $3500/100 loads= $35/load. I set an arbitrary 10 hour on full
      <br/>
      as the total power used so that equals $35/10 = $3.50 per hour additional
      <br/>
      cost just from the purchase of the generator. Now think of air filters, oil
      <br/>
      and oil filters, spark plugs, won't start, need mechanic, etc. You get the
      <br/>
      picture... Don't do it. Unless power off the grid exceeds $0.70 per kw hour
      <br/>
      in your area, you will be sorry you chose to use a generator. Go propane.

      Dear Michael,
      <br/>
      Thanks so much- this has been printed out and placed in plain site- HA- we
      <br/>
      pay   21 cents per KW here ( just called and asked). What you say makes a
      <br/>
      great deal of sense. Husband can just darn well buy himself a bigger gen to
      <br/>
      use with his welder and not lay it off on my kiln.  I REALLY appreciate all
      <br/>
      the work and time and thought you put into this e mail as it made it so very
      <br/>
      plain for me. When one starts talking generators and such I zone out but you
      <br/>
      made it downright interesting. Now I shall start kiln shopping. Anyone have
      <br/>
      a Kress kiln for sale? Picking Kress as my clay teacher used to be a Kress
      <br/>
      repairperson and here on Island they are as rare as snakes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Have a great one and again thanks.

      I like the idea, that is, if one aspire to run an Electric
      <br/>
      Kiln...or if one aspire to run anything...with Electricity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When I move, 'finally', I shall have a nice, (big, handsome,
      <br/>
      robust, and I hope, 'Old') Generator for
      <br/>
      myself.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I almost got one awhile back as ( I forget the output, but )
      <br/>
      seemed 'sufficient'...powered by a two-hundred eighty odd
      <br/>
      cubic
      <br/>
      inch Six-Cylinder "Herculese" (Side-Valve - aka 'Flat Head')
      <br/>
      Engine, the whole being on 'skids' and seeming a mite
      <br/>
      'heavy'
      <br/>
      to me so far as getting it brought home and all...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Made 1961 and needed a little 'tlc', but the price was
      <br/>
      'right' I felt, being some $500.00...it was clean and had no
      <br/>
      visable damage. 'Parts' did not appear to be a problem to my
      <br/>
      cursory researches, so
      <br/>
      far as rings and mainbearings and so on went, should it have
      <br/>
      needed them, and maybe it didn't...or, one could set up
      <br/>
      about any used Engine of
      <br/>
      suitable Horse Power to run the  Electricity making
      <br/>
      part...reconfigure the outfit for that...if one wanted.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Or jack up the 'Car' and run a hefty 'Belt' from a rear
      <br/>
      wheel...and use the thing as-needed...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It did not look like it would be shy from making 'plenty' of
      <br/>
      Amps, or 'watts' or...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Plenty of spunk, anyway...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So...once I am moved from here and have more room...I'll
      <br/>
      do it then...fine me one and bring 'er home and use it
      <br/>
      happily  too.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Run my 'lights' and little 'fridge from 'Batteries', and
      <br/>
      fire 'er up as needed for other matters or to recharge the
      <br/>
      Battery banks...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The hell with these infernal 'power companies'...I'd rather
      <br/>
      'pay' more to spite the bastards than continue to be a sap.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Or even...find a Gas line as is some ways before the 'meter'
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      when they are doing their 'maintenance' , (or, with some
      <br/>
      precipitateing interventions as may inspire them TO 'do'
      <br/>
      some 'maintenance' ) and they have
      <br/>
      matters thence
      <br/>
      in the 'off' mode, as they must do,  just run a little
      <br/>
      stub of a 'line' with a nice Ball Valve on it, and return to
      <br/>
      it at one's liesure...whilst 'Gardening' or whatever, and be
      <br/>
      a
      <br/>
      happy boy or girl...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Keeps the 'Oil' clean, and so on too
      <br/>
      that-a-way...round up some old 'Propane' Carburetor
      <br/>
      set-up...and...let 'er "purr"...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And why not?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Like they would not ( in fact, do not) 'do' the same?
      <br/>
      <br/>

        &gt; HI John,
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Thanks very much. This was really informative. I have been
        <br/>
        against the
        <br/>
        &gt; generator idea ( secretly think my husband just wants a
        <br/>
        bigger gen than he
        <br/>
        &gt; has now) and do not think with the amount of firing I
        <br/>
        shall do- maybe once a
        <br/>
        &gt; month that it shall be prohibitive. They are flexible with
        <br/>
        fires here-
        <br/>
        &gt; people still burn trash in barrels though I don't. The
        <br/>
        tradewinds keep the
        <br/>
        &gt; air super clean but I figure that pollution has to be
        <br/>
        going somewhere so
        <br/>
        &gt; just want to not add any for any other people.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; I shall print out all advise I get and go from there. The
        <br/>
        cost to ship over
        <br/>
        &gt; is gonna kill me but getting a used one here on the Island
        <br/>
        is like finding
        <br/>
        &gt; gold. Wood expensive unless we use the trees around that
        <br/>
        are like balsa
        <br/>
        &gt; which burn up in 2 secs. I intend to ask my brother about
        <br/>
        the home made gas
        <br/>
        &gt; kiln though as might be feasible. I am interested in
        <br/>
        functional so that
        <br/>
        &gt; makes me require more also.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Again thanks much. I envy you Alaska- well someday I shall
        <br/>
        see it
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>

          <br/>
          &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Carol, I understand about the price of energy  to run
          <br/>
          kilns being
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; expensive. I lived in Alaska for a long time, and as
          <br/>
          with Hiwaii, the
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; further out in the bush one went, the more expensive
          <br/>
          everything got.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; As to energy for the kiln, you really need to look at
          <br/>
          the various
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; options and consider the long and short of it.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Electricity: I'm sure  it is locally available, everyone
          <br/>
          has it to one
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; degree or another, and it is readily, though expensively
          <br/>
          available to
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; run a kiln. No muss, no fuss or at least minimally so in
          <br/>
          getting an
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; electric kiln hooked up and ready to go.Requires you to
          <br/>
          buy a kiln on
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; the mainland, have it shipped, all relatively
          <br/>
          expensive - Kiln plus
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; shipping, plus hook up.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Gas: I don't know about natural or propane gas there,
          <br/>
          but expensive I
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; would expect as compared to electricity. But would burn
          <br/>
          clean, minimum
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; fuss. If you were inovative, I would bet you could build
          <br/>
          a small gas
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; kiln for less than it would cost you to import an
          <br/>
          electric kiln. Then
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; you would only need to be concerned about gas costs. You
          <br/>
          would not need
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; to be concerned about electrical outages disrupting a
          <br/>
          firing - unless
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; you have used electricity some way in the operation of
          <br/>
          the gas kiln.  Of
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; course local ordinances may have a negative impact. But
          <br/>
          I would
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; certainly look into the real cost of gas vs electricity.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Home Owner Generator Electricity - A generator capable
          <br/>
          of production of
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; power to supply 12500 Watts of power - 240 volts at
          <br/>
          50-60 amps for 12
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; hours is going to be one expensive puppy  to purchase.
          <br/>
          Then there is the
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; cost of maintenance on it. Then there is the cost of the
          <br/>
          gas to run it
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; and that to will be a very expensive issue in Hiwaii.
          <br/>
          If you get a
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; diesel fuel generator, the purchase cost will go up
          <br/>
          again but hourly
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; operating cost will be lower. . In Alaska many people
          <br/>
          living in remote
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; locations used one-lungers as they were called - one
          <br/>
          cylinder diesel
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; generators -the Witte Generator was a popular brand.
          <br/>
          Pricey though but
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; more efficient over all, and very dependable,  than gas
          <br/>
          because the same
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; fuel could be used to heat your house, and cook with,
          <br/>
          and heat your hot
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; water. Less of a fire hazard than gas. Easier to
          <br/>
          transport because of
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; the reduced fire hazard.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Wood: Local woods might be available if you check
          <br/>
          around, so a wood fire
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; kiln might be an option, although I expect there useable
          <br/>
          wood would be
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; very scarce.. Then there may be environmental concerns
          <br/>
          as well as code
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; limitations.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Coal: Prol'ly out of the question
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; But I would certainly look into the real cost of gas vs
          <br/>
          electricity.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Unless you are in a location where some other fuel is
          <br/>
          convienently and
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; inexpensively available electricity is probably going to
          <br/>
          be the cheapest
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; energy available to you, regardless. In Alaska, in
          <br/>
          certain areas along
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; the coast, there is coal sticking up out of the ground
          <br/>
          and sand. It's
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; low grade, but it burns, and anyone with the will can go
          <br/>
          to the beaches
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; ansimply load theirs truck with it, come home and burn
          <br/>
          it in their
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; stove, kiln or what have you. That is about as cheap as
          <br/>
          it gets. But for
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; most of us any where in the country, even Hiwaii, and
          <br/>
          even as expensive
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; as it is there, electricity is going to be the cheapest
          <br/>
          energy  going.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Good luck on your quest to get up and running on firing.

          &gt; live in

          &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hawaii and and the cost of electricity is very high.
          <br/>
          Is it possible to

          &gt; run
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it off of say a 13000 KW generator?  My husband seems
          <br/>
          to think it would
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;work. Any help on this subject would be greatly

          appreciated. I cannot go

          &gt; gas

      Hi,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Boy you and my husband would get along great. He would love to run
      <br/>
      everything off generators and batteries. I agree with the whole concept but
      <br/>
      guess I am spoiled so try to eliminate the generator in my fields and use in
      <br/>
      his. HA- mechanically challenged I am and even the thought of using a kiln
      <br/>
      is daunting enough at this point without adding in running the generator. I
      <br/>
      would love to be able to bypass the electric company as we pay 27 cents. Now
      <br/>
      give me windpower. That I would love but the Native Hawaiians just do not
      <br/>
      like windmills dotting the countryside which I can agree can be unsightly.
      <br/>
      Thanks for your time and your input. I do so appreciate all the help and
      <br/>
      advise I have been given.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Much Aloha,
      <br/>

        &gt; I like the idea, that is, if one aspire to run an Electric
        <br/>
        &gt; Kiln...or if one aspire to run anything...with Electricity.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; When I move, 'finally', I shall have a nice, (big, handsome,
        <br/>
        &gt; robust, and I hope, 'Old') Generator for
        <br/>
        &gt; myself.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; I almost got one awhile back as ( I forget the output, but )
        <br/>
        &gt; seemed 'sufficient'...powered by a two-hundred eighty odd
        <br/>
        &gt; cubic
        <br/>
        &gt; inch Six-Cylinder "Herculese" (Side-Valve - aka 'Flat Head')
        <br/>
        &gt; Engine, the whole being on 'skids' and seeming a mite
        <br/>
        &gt; 'heavy'
        <br/>
        &gt; to me so far as getting it brought home and all...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Made 1961 and needed a little 'tlc', but the price was
        <br/>
        &gt; 'right' I felt, being some $500.00...it was clean and had no
        <br/>
        &gt; visable damage. 'Parts' did not appear to be a problem to my
        <br/>
        &gt; cursory researches, so
        <br/>
        &gt; far as rings and mainbearings and so on went, should it have
        <br/>
        &gt; needed them, and maybe it didn't...or, one could set up
        <br/>
        &gt; about any used Engine of
        <br/>
        &gt; suitable Horse Power to run the  Electricity making
        <br/>
        &gt; part...reconfigure the outfit for that...if one wanted.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Or jack up the 'Car' and run a hefty 'Belt' from a rear
        <br/>
        &gt; wheel...and use the thing as-needed...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; It did not look like it would be shy from making 'plenty' of
        <br/>
        &gt; Amps, or 'watts' or...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Plenty of spunk, anyway...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; So...once I am moved from here and have more room...I'll
        <br/>
        &gt; do it then...fine me one and bring 'er home and use it
        <br/>
        &gt; happily  too.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Run my 'lights' and little 'fridge from 'Batteries', and
        <br/>
        &gt; fire 'er up as needed for other matters or to recharge the
        <br/>
        &gt; Battery banks...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; The hell with these infernal 'power companies'...I'd rather
        <br/>
        &gt; 'pay' more to spite the bastards than continue to be a sap.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Or even...find a Gas line as is some ways before the 'meter'
        <br/>
        &gt; and
        <br/>
        &gt; when they are doing their 'maintenance' , (or, with some
        <br/>
        &gt; precipitateing interventions as may inspire them TO 'do'
        <br/>
        &gt; some 'maintenance' ) and they have
        <br/>
        &gt; matters thence
        <br/>
        &gt; in the 'off' mode, as they must do,  just run a little
        <br/>
        &gt; stub of a 'line' with a nice Ball Valve on it, and return to
        <br/>
        &gt; it at one's liesure...whilst 'Gardening' or whatever, and be

        &gt; happy boy or girl...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Keeps the 'Oil' clean, and so on too
        <br/>
        &gt; that-a-way...round up some old 'Propane' Carburetor
        <br/>
        &gt; set-up...and...let 'er "purr"...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>

          &gt; &gt; HI John,
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Thanks very much. This was really informative. I have been
          <br/>
          &gt; against the
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; generator idea ( secretly think my husband just wants a
          <br/>
          &gt; bigger gen than he
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; has now) and do not think with the amount of firing I
          <br/>
          &gt; shall do- maybe once a
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; month that it shall be prohibitive. They are flexible with
          <br/>
          &gt; fires here-
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; people still burn trash in barrels though I don't. The
          <br/>
          &gt; tradewinds keep the
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; air super clean but I figure that pollution has to be
          <br/>
          &gt; going somewhere so
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; just want to not add any for any other people.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; I shall print out all advise I get and go from there. The
          <br/>
          &gt; cost to ship over
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; is gonna kill me but getting a used one here on the Island
          <br/>
          &gt; is like finding
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; gold. Wood expensive unless we use the trees around that
          <br/>
          &gt; are like balsa
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; which burn up in 2 secs. I intend to ask my brother about
          <br/>
          &gt; the home made gas
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; kiln though as might be feasible. I am interested in
          <br/>
          &gt; functional so that
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; makes me require more also.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Again thanks much. I envy you Alaska- well someday I shall
          <br/>
          &gt; see it
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Have a great one and thanks for your time,

            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Carol, I understand about the price of energy  to run
            <br/>
            &gt; kilns being
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive. I lived in Alaska for a long time, and as
            <br/>
            &gt; with Hiwaii, the
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; further out in the bush one went, the more expensive
            <br/>
            &gt; everything got.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; As to energy for the kiln, you really need to look at
            <br/>
            &gt; the various
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; options and consider the long and short of it.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Electricity: I'm sure  it is locally available, everyone
            <br/>
            &gt; has it to one
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; degree or another, and it is readily, though expensively
            <br/>
            &gt; available to
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; run a kiln. No muss, no fuss or at least minimally so in
            <br/>
            &gt; getting an
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; electric kiln hooked up and ready to go.Requires you to
            <br/>
            &gt; buy a kiln on
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; the mainland, have it shipped, all relatively
            <br/>
            &gt; expensive - Kiln plus
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; shipping, plus hook up.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Gas: I don't know about natural or propane gas there,
            <br/>
            &gt; but expensive I
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; would expect as compared to electricity. But would burn
            <br/>
            &gt; clean, minimum
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; fuss. If you were inovative, I would bet you could build
            <br/>
            &gt; a small gas
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; kiln for less than it would cost you to import an
            <br/>
            &gt; electric kiln. Then
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; you would only need to be concerned about gas costs. You
            <br/>
            &gt; would not need
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; to be concerned about electrical outages disrupting a
            <br/>
            &gt; firing - unless
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; you have used electricity some way in the operation of
            <br/>
            &gt; the gas kiln.  Of
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; course local ordinances may have a negative impact. But
            <br/>
            &gt; I would
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly look into the real cost of gas vs electricity.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Home Owner Generator Electricity - A generator capable
            <br/>
            &gt; of production of
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; power to supply 12500 Watts of power - 240 volts at
            <br/>
            &gt; 50-60 amps for 12
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; hours is going to be one expensive puppy  to purchase.
            <br/>
            &gt; Then there is the
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; cost of maintenance on it. Then there is the cost of the
            <br/>
            &gt; gas to run it
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; and that to will be a very expensive issue in Hiwaii.
            <br/>
            &gt; If you get a
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; diesel fuel generator, the purchase cost will go up
            <br/>
            &gt; again but hourly
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; operating cost will be lower. . In Alaska many people
            <br/>
            &gt; living in remote
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; locations used one-lungers as they were called - one
            <br/>
            &gt; cylinder diesel
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; generators -the Witte Generator was a popular brand.
            <br/>
            &gt; Pricey though but
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; more efficient over all, and very dependable,  than gas
            <br/>
            &gt; because the same
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; fuel could be used to heat your house, and cook with,
            <br/>
            &gt; and heat your hot
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; water. Less of a fire hazard than gas. Easier to
            <br/>
            &gt; transport because of
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; the reduced fire hazard.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Wood: Local woods might be available if you check
            <br/>
            &gt; around, so a wood fire
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; kiln might be an option, although I expect there useable
            <br/>
            &gt; wood would be
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; very scarce.. Then there may be environmental concerns
            <br/>
            &gt; as well as code
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations.

            &gt; &gt; &gt; Coal: Prol'ly out of the question
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; But I would certainly look into the real cost of gas vs
            <br/>
            &gt; electricity.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless you are in a location where some other fuel is
            <br/>
            &gt; convienently and
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; inexpensively available electricity is probably going to
            <br/>
            &gt; be the cheapest
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; energy available to you, regardless. In Alaska, in
            <br/>
            &gt; certain areas along
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; the coast, there is coal sticking up out of the ground
            <br/>
            &gt; and sand. It's
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; low grade, but it burns, and anyone with the will can go
            <br/>
            &gt; to the beaches
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; ansimply load theirs truck with it, come home and burn
            <br/>
            &gt; it in their
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; stove, kiln or what have you. That is about as cheap as
            <br/>
            &gt; it gets. But for
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; most of us any where in the country, even Hiwaii, and
            <br/>
            &gt; even as expensive
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; as it is there, electricity is going to be the cheapest
            <br/>
            &gt; energy  going.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;

            &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck on your quest to get up and running on firing.

            &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I will soon be ordering a Kress kiln and am very new

            &gt; Is it possible to

            <br/>

            &gt; to think it would

            &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;work. Any help on this subject would be greatly

      You put that so wonderfully I want to build a windmill. Only problem is the
      <br/>
      neighbors would run me out of the area in a heartbeat. My husband I
      <br/>
      thoroughly enjoyed this message. Thanks so much. Aw, the things that could

      be if we only let our wings soar.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        &gt; Hi Carol,
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Yes indeed, how wonderful it would be to generate
        <br/>
        &gt; Electricity with the Wind...
        <br/>
        &gt; And that it is very elegant to do so, or can be.
        <br/>
        &gt; Actually, that was allways
        <br/>
        &gt; a big dream of mine - and I would still love to do it.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; One could certainly make a Windmill as would run a generator
        <br/>
        &gt; sufficient to power a Kiln, provided there were something of
        <br/>
        &gt; a steady breeze to rely on, and it would be such fun to do
        <br/>
        &gt; so too...if maybe a little expensive to build, and needing a
        <br/>
        &gt; 'keeper' to attend or maintain somewhat.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Also, one can generate Electricity harnessing the motion of
        <br/>
        &gt; Waves or Tides, but not so nicely in some ways compared
        <br/>
        &gt; to doing so from the sundry currents of steadily flowing Air
        <br/>
        &gt; or
        <br/>
        &gt; Water.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; It would be an interesting task to get Electricity from
        <br/>
        &gt; motion of the
        <br/>
        &gt; Ocean's
        <br/>
        &gt; waves, and it would be an interesting, challengeing project
        <br/>
        &gt; to make a
        <br/>
        &gt; device as
        <br/>
        &gt; would generate enough for a Kiln...but as for
        <br/>
        &gt; household Lighting, as is mediated with Batteries, it would
        <br/>
        &gt; not be near so huge a chore I don't think.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; I had sat down once ( jeeeeesh, like in 1982?) and figured
        <br/>
        &gt; out
        <br/>
        &gt; the details of running
        <br/>
        &gt; my ( then mostly 'envisioned') Shop from a Windmill, or as
        <br/>
        &gt; well from the
        <br/>
        &gt; Batteries it would
        <br/>
        &gt; keep charged, as well as running Machines through shafts and
        <br/>
        &gt; belts as are powered directly from the Windmill's
        <br/>
        &gt; transmitted rotations...or to sell 'power' to neighbors, if
        <br/>
        &gt; I had a truely 'steady' breeze as my companion.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; One could also emply a Hydraulic method to transmit the
        <br/>
        &gt; Wind's force to run one's Machines or what, rather than
        <br/>
        &gt; shafts and
        <br/>
        &gt; belts, which is a good option.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; One may make large wet Cell Batteries fairly easily, which
        <br/>
        &gt; is kinder to the pocket book than the cost and freight of
        <br/>
        &gt; buying them. It is helpfulif one likes the smell of Hydrogen
        <br/>
        &gt; and Sulfuric Acid, and it is best not to light Cigarettes
        <br/>
        &gt; when the big-boys are in a 'charging-mode'...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; As I could build a very decent windmill to suit my
        <br/>
        &gt; intentions, (or if I had the money for materials, and the
        <br/>
        &gt; time and place TO do it,) the entire thing would be a great
        <br/>
        &gt; and integrated project to do,
        <br/>
        &gt; and
        <br/>
        &gt; very nearly all of it 'made' rather than 'bought'...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; One may make a dynamo for generateing the 'D-C', and one may
        <br/>
        &gt; make a
        <br/>
        &gt; generator as well for one's 'A-C' to be run either from  the
        <br/>
        &gt; Windmill itself, or from a 'D-C'
        <br/>
        &gt; Motor as run from the Batteries iif the Breeze is on a
        <br/>
        &gt; respite...just as one please, and
        <br/>
        &gt; to look as one want them to look, too.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Most modern Windmills as I had seen through the years,
        <br/>
        &gt; ( that is, aside from the very scarce now of 'Farm' pump
        <br/>
        &gt; types
        <br/>
        &gt; and I am not thinking of those for these kinds of 'work') do
        <br/>
        &gt; not
        <br/>
        &gt; seem to have the torque
        <br/>
        &gt; to do much, or, are no longer made forthrightly of Wood, or
        <br/>
        &gt; of Wood and Steel, in such ways as where a Man could readily
        <br/>
        &gt; make one. They look like they are designed by computers,
        <br/>
        &gt; and made by aeronautical firms.
        <br/>
        &gt; The older designs as enjoyed promenance in their
        <br/>
        &gt; day, are something an intelligent Mechanic can
        <br/>
        &gt; build, and even if reduced in
        <br/>
        &gt; their scale,
        <br/>
        &gt; may put our plenty of torque for one's needs.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; I think the one I  had decided to make was calculated to
        <br/>
        &gt; produce about 32 Horsepower in a six mile an hour wind,
        <br/>
        &gt; and
        <br/>
        &gt; pretty much silently, too...which would still give me plenty
        <br/>
        &gt; in a four or five mile an hour  of breeze, or, simply, more
        <br/>
        &gt; power
        <br/>
        &gt; than I'd ever need maybe anyway...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; As it's design enjoyed a self regulateing variable pitch to
        <br/>
        &gt; the blades, irregularities in  the Wind's velocity were
        <br/>
        &gt; somewhat smoothed out as per the setting one elects for the
        <br/>
        &gt; R.P.M. regulation as effects the pitch, and also, it moved
        <br/>
        &gt; to follow the Wind's
        <br/>
        &gt; direction, as did most of the old ones.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; In the event of high Winds, one is best to unleash the
        <br/>
        &gt; riggings and slide the Oil-Cloths from the Blades...and wait
        <br/>
        &gt; matters out. These kind did not rotate swiftly...and ( I do
        <br/>
        &gt; not remember now, but) likely are happy at something like,
        <br/>
        &gt; or not far from, 20 or 30 to maybe 45 R.P.M. I think...but
        <br/>
        &gt; not much more.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; The four or six Blades being as some thirty feet in
        <br/>
        &gt; length, describe then a circle of some sixty odd
        <br/>
        &gt; feet...not something meant to rotate very quickly, nor
        <br/>
        &gt; needing to.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; This - the mechanical method for Machines to be run from
        <br/>
        &gt; some Wind or Water source - had been quite popular at one
        <br/>
        &gt; time
        <br/>
        &gt; and you may recall that America had near as many Windmills
        <br/>
        &gt; as Holland for all
        <br/>
        &gt; sorts of tasks.
        <br/>
        &gt; Many Shops and small Factories and Mills also were run from
        <br/>
        &gt; Water
        <br/>
        &gt; Wheels, or from Water driven Turbines set fairly deeply in
        <br/>
        &gt; Rivers or
        <br/>
        &gt; Streams ( which
        <br/>
        &gt; had advantage in
        <br/>
        &gt; colder climes when the surface had frozen to some deapth).
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; One could buy such 'Turbines' mail order through much of the
        <br/>
        &gt; second half of the Nineteenth Cent...
        <br/>
        &gt; I have no idea of what may be available now in  these
        <br/>
        &gt; matters, but it is a very good method if one does not mind
        <br/>
        &gt; there being not much to see, as compared to a Windmill...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; As most of my Machines were 'flat-belt' or remain so, and
        <br/>
        &gt; shall even more so over time, and
        <br/>
        &gt; others may be readily converted to that way-of-faith, it
        <br/>
        &gt; would not be hard to have all my Stationary Machines set up
        <br/>
        &gt; to be run from the belts and shafts driven of a Windmill's
        <br/>
        &gt; turns. Whilst the smaller Electric Tools could certainly
        <br/>
        &gt; be run from a small 'A-C' or some of them on a 'D-C' out-put
        <br/>
        &gt; got as above mentioned.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Be fun...and very satisfying I think...
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Hmmmmmmm...it is hard to think of anything I'd rather do,
        <br/>
        &gt; now that I muse on it!
        <br/>
        &gt;

          &gt; &gt; Hi,
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Boy you and my husband would get along great. He would
          <br/>
          &gt; love to run
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; everything off generators and batteries. I agree with the
          <br/>
          &gt; whole concept but
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; guess I am spoiled so try to eliminate the generator in my
          <br/>
          &gt; fields and use in
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; his. HA- mechanically challenged I am and even the thought
          <br/>
          &gt; of using a kiln
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; is daunting enough at this point without adding in running
          <br/>
          &gt; the generator. I
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; would love to be able to bypass the electric company as we
          <br/>
          &gt; pay 27 cents. Now
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; give me windpower. That I would love but the Native
          <br/>
          &gt; Hawaiians just do not
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; like windmills dotting the countryside which I can agree
          <br/>
          &gt; can be unsightly.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Thanks for your time and your input. I do so appreciate
          <br/>
          &gt; all the help and

            &gt; but )
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; seemed 'sufficient'...powered by a two-hundred eighty
            <br/>
            &gt; odd
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; cubic
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; inch Six-Cylinder "Herculese" (Side-Valve - aka 'Flat
            <br/>
            &gt; Head')
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Engine, the whole being on 'skids' and seeming a mite
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; 'heavy'
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; to me so far as getting it brought home and all...
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Made 1961 and needed a little 'tlc', but the price was
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; 'right' I felt, being some $500.00...it was clean and
            <br/>
            &gt; had no
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; visable damage. 'Parts' did not appear to be a problem
            <br/>
            &gt; to my
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; cursory researches, so
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; far as rings and mainbearings and so on went, should it
            <br/>
            &gt; have
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; needed them, and maybe it didn't...or, one could set up
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; about any used Engine of
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; suitable Horse Power to run the  Electricity making
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; part...reconfigure the outfit for that...if one wanted.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Or jack up the 'Car' and run a hefty 'Belt' from a rear
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; wheel...and use the thing as-needed...
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; It did not look like it would be shy from making
            <br/>
            &gt; 'plenty' of
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Amps, or 'watts' or...
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Plenty of spunk, anyway...
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; So...once I am moved from here and have more room...I'll
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; do it then...fine me one and bring 'er home and use it
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; happily  too.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Run my 'lights' and little 'fridge from 'Batteries', and
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; fire 'er up as needed for other matters or to recharge
            <br/>
            &gt; the

            &gt; &gt; &gt; Battery banks...

            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; The hell with these infernal 'power companies'...I'd
            <br/>
            &gt; rather
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; 'pay' more to spite the bastards than continue to be a
            <br/>
            &gt; sap.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Or even...find a Gas line as is some ways before the
            <br/>
            &gt; 'meter'
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; and
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; when they are doing their 'maintenance' , (or, with some
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; precipitateing interventions as may inspire them TO 'do'
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; some 'maintenance' ) and they have
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; matters thence
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; in the 'off' mode, as they must do,  just run a little
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; stub of a 'line' with a nice Ball Valve on it, and
            <br/>
            &gt; return to
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; it at one's liesure...whilst 'Gardening' or whatever,
            <br/>
            &gt; and be

            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; that-a-way...round up some old 'Propane' Carburetor
            <br/>

              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HI John,
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks very much. This was really informative. I have
              <br/>
              &gt; been
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; against the
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generator idea ( secretly think my husband just wants
              <br/>
              &gt; a
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; bigger gen than he
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has now) and do not think with the amount of firing I
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; shall do- maybe once a
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; month that it shall be prohibitive. They are flexible
              <br/>
              &gt; with
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; fires here-
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people still burn trash in barrels though I don't. The
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; tradewinds keep the
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air super clean but I figure that pollution has to be
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; going somewhere so
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just want to not add any for any other people.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I shall print out all advise I get and go from there.
              <br/>
              &gt; The
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; cost to ship over
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is gonna kill me but getting a used one here on the
              <br/>
              &gt; Island
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; is like finding
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gold. Wood expensive unless we use the trees around
              <br/>
              &gt; that
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; are like balsa
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which burn up in 2 secs. I intend to ask my brother
              <br/>
              &gt; about
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; the home made gas
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kiln though as might be feasible. I am interested in
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; functional so that
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes me require more also.
              <br/>

              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again thanks much. I envy you Alaska- well someday I
              <br/>

                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carol, I understand about the price of energy  to

                &gt; run
                <br/>

                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive. I lived in Alaska for a long time, and as

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As to energy for the kiln, you really need to look
                <br/>
                &gt; at
                <br/>

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; options and consider the long and short of it.
                <br/>

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; electric kiln. Then
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you would only need to be concerned about gas costs.

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; would not need
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be concerned about electrical outages disrupting

                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly look into the real cost of gas vs

                <br/>

                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cost of maintenance on it. Then there is the cost of

                <br/>

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more efficient over all, and very dependable,  than

                &gt; is
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; convienently and
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inexpensively available electricity is probably
                <br/>
                &gt; going to
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; be the cheapest
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy available to you, regardless. In Alaska, in
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; certain areas along
                <br/>

                &gt; ground
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; and sand. It's
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low grade, but it burns, and anyone with the will
                <br/>
                &gt; can go
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; to the beaches

                &gt; &gt; &gt; it in their
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stove, kiln or what have you. That is about as cheap

                &gt; as
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; it gets. But for

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as it is there, electricity is going to be the

                &gt; &gt; &gt; to this art. We

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hawaii and and the cost of electricity is very

                &gt; high.
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible to
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run

                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; to think it would
                <br/>
                &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;work. Any help on this subject would be greatly

                &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated. I cannot go

                <br/>

      Hi Carol,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Yes indeed, how wonderful it would be to generate
      <br/>
      Electricity with the Wind...
      <br/>
      And that it is very elegant to do so, or can be.
      <br/>
      Actually, that was allways
      <br/>
      a big dream of mine - and I would still love to do it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One could certainly make a Windmill as would run a generator
      <br/>
      sufficient to power a Kiln, provided there were something of
      <br/>
      a steady breeze to rely on, and it would be such fun to do
      <br/>
      so too...if maybe a little expensive to build, and needing a
      <br/>
      'keeper' to attend or maintain somewhat.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Also, one can generate Electricity harnessing the motion of
      <br/>
      Waves or Tides, but not so nicely in some ways compared
      <br/>
      to doing so from the sundry currents of steadily flowing Air
      <br/>
      or
      <br/>
      Water.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It would be an interesting task to get Electricity from
      <br/>
      motion of the
      <br/>
      Ocean's
      <br/>
      waves, and it would be an interesting, challengeing project
      <br/>
      to make a
      <br/>
      device as
      <br/>
      would generate enough for a Kiln...but as for
      <br/>
      household Lighting, as is mediated with Batteries, it would
      <br/>
      not be near so huge a chore I don't think.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I had sat down once ( jeeeeesh, like in 1982?) and figured
      <br/>
      out
      <br/>
      the details of running
      <br/>
      my ( then mostly 'envisioned') Shop from a Windmill, or as
      <br/>
      well from the
      <br/>
      Batteries it would
      <br/>
      keep charged, as well as running Machines through shafts and
      <br/>
      belts as are powered directly from the Windmill's
      <br/>
      transmitted rotations...or to sell 'power' to neighbors, if
      <br/>
      I had a truely 'steady' breeze as my companion.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One could also emply a Hydraulic method to transmit the
      <br/>
      Wind's force to run one's Machines or what, rather than
      <br/>
      shafts and
      <br/>
      belts, which is a good option.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One may make large wet Cell Batteries fairly easily, which
      <br/>
      is kinder to the pocket book than the cost and freight of
      <br/>
      buying them. It is helpfulif one likes the smell of Hydrogen
      <br/>
      and Sulfuric Acid, and it is best not to light Cigarettes
      <br/>
      when the big-boys are in a 'charging-mode'...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As I could build a very decent windmill to suit my
      <br/>
      intentions, (or if I had the money for materials, and the
      <br/>
      time and place TO do it,) the entire thing would be a great
      <br/>
      and integrated project to do,
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      very nearly all of it 'made' rather than 'bought'...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One may make a dynamo for generateing the 'D-C', and one may
      <br/>
      make a
      <br/>
      generator as well for one's 'A-C' to be run either from  the
      <br/>
      Windmill itself, or from a 'D-C'
      <br/>
      Motor as run from the Batteries iif the Breeze is on a
      <br/>
      respite...just as one please, and
      <br/>
      to look as one want them to look, too.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Most modern Windmills as I had seen through the years,
      <br/>
      ( that is, aside from the very scarce now of 'Farm' pump
      <br/>
      types
      <br/>
      and I am not thinking of those for these kinds of 'work') do
      <br/>
      not
      <br/>
      seem to have the torque
      <br/>
      to do much, or, are no longer made forthrightly of Wood, or
      <br/>
      of Wood and Steel, in such ways as where a Man could readily
      <br/>
      make one. They look like they are designed by computers,
      <br/>
      and made by aeronautical firms.
      <br/>
      The older designs as enjoyed promenance in their
      <br/>
      day, are something an intelligent Mechanic can
      <br/>
      build, and even if reduced in
      <br/>
      their scale,
      <br/>
      may put our plenty of torque for one's needs.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I think the one I  had decided to make was calculated to
      <br/>
      produce about 32 Horsepower in a six mile an hour wind,
      <br/>
      and
      <br/>
      pretty much silently, too...which would still give me plenty
      <br/>
      in a four or five mile an hour  of breeze, or, simply, more
      <br/>
      power
      <br/>
      than I'd ever need maybe anyway...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As it's design enjoyed a self regulateing variable pitch to
      <br/>
      the blades, irregularities in  the Wind's velocity were
      <br/>
      somewhat smoothed out as per the setting one elects for the
      <br/>
      R.P.M. regulation as effects the pitch, and also, it moved
      <br/>
      to follow the Wind's
      <br/>
      direction, as did most of the old ones.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the event of high Winds, one is best to unleash the
      <br/>
      riggings and slide the Oil-Cloths from the Blades...and wait
      <br/>
      matters out. These kind did not rotate swiftly...and ( I do
      <br/>
      not remember now, but) likely are happy at something like,
      <br/>
      or not far from, 20 or 30 to maybe 45 R.P.M. I think...but
      <br/>
      not much more.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The four or six Blades being as some thirty feet in
      <br/>
      length, describe then a circle of some sixty odd
      <br/>
      feet...not something meant to rotate very quickly, nor
      <br/>
      needing to.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This - the mechanical method for Machines to be run from
      <br/>
      some Wind or Water source - had been quite popular at one
      <br/>
      time
      <br/>
      and you may recall that America had near as many Windmills
      <br/>
      as Holland for all
      <br/>
      sorts of tasks.
      <br/>
      Many Shops and small Factories and Mills also were run from
      <br/>
      Water
      <br/>
      Wheels, or from Water driven Turbines set fairly deeply in
      <br/>
      Rivers or
      <br/>
      Streams ( which
      <br/>
      had advantage in
      <br/>
      colder climes when the surface had frozen to some deapth).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One could buy such 'Turbines' mail order through much of the
      <br/>
      second half of the Nineteenth Cent...
      <br/>
      I have no idea of what may be available now in  these
      <br/>
      matters, but it is a very good method if one does not mind
      <br/>
      there being not much to see, as compared to a Windmill...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As most of my Machines were 'flat-belt' or remain so, and
      <br/>
      shall even more so over time, and
      <br/>
      others may be readily converted to that way-of-faith, it
      <br/>
      would not be hard to have all my Stationary Machines set up
      <br/>
      to be run from the belts and shafts driven of a Windmill's
      <br/>
      turns. Whilst the smaller Electric Tools could certainly
      <br/>
      be run from a small 'A-C' or some of them on a 'D-C' out-put
      <br/>
      got as above mentioned.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Be fun...and very satisfying I think...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Hmmmmmmm...it is hard to think of anything I'd rather do,
      <br/>
      now that I muse on it!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The best of all 'worlds' in it's way...
      <br/>

        &gt; Hi,
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>
        &gt; Boy you and my husband would get along great. He would
        <br/>
        love to run
        <br/>
        &gt; everything off generators and batteries. I agree with the
        <br/>
        whole concept but
        <br/>
        &gt; guess I am spoiled so try to eliminate the generator in my
        <br/>
        fields and use in
        <br/>
        &gt; his. HA- mechanically challenged I am and even the thought
        <br/>
        of using a kiln
        <br/>
        &gt; is daunting enough at this point without adding in running
        <br/>
        the generator. I
        <br/>
        &gt; would love to be able to bypass the electric company as we
        <br/>
        pay 27 cents. Now
        <br/>
        &gt; give me windpower. That I would love but the Native
        <br/>
        Hawaiians just do not
        <br/>
        &gt; like windmills dotting the countryside which I can agree
        <br/>
        can be unsightly.
        <br/>
        &gt; Thanks for your time and your input. I do so appreciate
        <br/>
        all the help and
        <br/>
        &gt; advise I have been given.
        <br/>
        &gt;
        <br/>

          &gt; &gt; I like the idea, that is, if one aspire to run an
          <br/>
          Electric
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Kiln...or if one aspire to run anything...with
          <br/>
          Electricity.

          &gt; &gt; When I move, 'finally', I shall have a nice, (big,

          handsome,
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; robust, and I hope, 'Old') Generator for
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; myself.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; I almost got one awhile back as ( I forget the output,
          <br/>
          but )
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; seemed 'sufficient'...powered by a two-hundred eighty
          <br/>
          odd
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; cubic

          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Engine, the whole being on 'skids' and seeming a mite

          &gt; &gt; 'heavy'
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; to me so far as getting it brought home and all...

          &gt; &gt; 'right' I felt, being some $500.00...it was clean and
          <br/>

          to my

          &gt; &gt; cursory researches, so

          &gt; &gt; far as rings and mainbearings and so on went, should it

          &gt; &gt; needed them, and maybe it didn't...or, one could set up
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; about any used Engine of
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; suitable Horse Power to run the  Electricity making
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; part...reconfigure the outfit for that...if one wanted.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Or jack up the 'Car' and run a hefty 'Belt' from a rear
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; wheel...and use the thing as-needed...
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; It did not look like it would be shy from making
          <br/>
          'plenty' of
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Amps, or 'watts' or...
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Plenty of spunk, anyway...
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; So...once I am moved from here and have more room...I'll
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; do it then...fine me one and bring 'er home and use it
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; happily  too.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Run my 'lights' and little 'fridge from 'Batteries', and
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; fire 'er up as needed for other matters or to recharge
          <br/>
          the
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Battery banks...
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; The hell with these infernal 'power companies'...I'd
          <br/>
          rather
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; 'pay' more to spite the bastards than continue to be a
          <br/>
          sap.
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; Or even...find a Gas line as is some ways before the
          <br/>
          'meter'
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; and
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; when they are doing their 'maintenance' , (or, with some

          &gt; &gt; precipitateing interventions as may inspire them TO 'do'
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; some 'maintenance' ) and they have

          &gt; &gt; matters thence
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; in the 'off' mode, as they must do,  just run a little
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; stub of a 'line' with a nice Ball Valve on it, and
          <br/>
          return to
          <br/>
          &gt; &gt; it at one's liesure...whilst 'Gardening' or whatever,

          and be

            &gt; &gt; &gt; HI John,
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks very much. This was really informative. I have
            <br/>
            been
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; against the
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; generator idea ( secretly think my husband just wants
            <br/>
            a
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; bigger gen than he
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; has now) and do not think with the amount of firing I
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; shall do- maybe once a
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; month that it shall be prohibitive. They are flexible
            <br/>
            with
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; fires here-
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; people still burn trash in barrels though I don't. The
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; tradewinds keep the
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; air super clean but I figure that pollution has to be
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; going somewhere so
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; just want to not add any for any other people.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; I shall print out all advise I get and go from there.
            <br/>
            The
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; cost to ship over
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; is gonna kill me but getting a used one here on the
            <br/>
            Island
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; is like finding
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; gold. Wood expensive unless we use the trees around
            <br/>
            that
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; are like balsa
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; which burn up in 2 secs. I intend to ask my brother
            <br/>
            about
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; the home made gas
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; kiln though as might be feasible. I am interested in
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; functional so that
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; makes me require more also.
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Again thanks much. I envy you Alaska- well someday I
            <br/>
            shall
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; see it
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt;
            <br/>
            &gt; &gt; &gt; Have a great one and thanks for your time,

              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carol, I understand about the price of energy  to
              <br/>
              run
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; kilns being
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive. I lived in Alaska for a long time, and as
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; with Hiwaii, the
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further out in the bush one went, the more expensive

              &gt; &gt; everything got.
              <br/>

              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As to energy for the kiln, you really need to look
              <br/>
              at
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; the various
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; options and consider the long and short of it.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Electricity: I'm sure  it is locally available,
              <br/>
              everyone
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; has it to one
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; degree or another, and it is readily, though
              <br/>
              expensively
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; available to
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run a kiln. No muss, no fuss or at least minimally
              <br/>
              so in
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; getting an
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electric kiln hooked up and ready to go.Requires you
              <br/>
              to
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; buy a kiln on
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mainland, have it shipped, all relatively
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; expensive - Kiln plus
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shipping, plus hook up.

              <br/>
              there,
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; but expensive I
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would expect as compared to electricity. But would
              <br/>
              burn
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; clean, minimum
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fuss. If you were inovative, I would bet you could
              <br/>
              build
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; a small gas
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kiln for less than it would cost you to import an
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; electric kiln. Then
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you would only need to be concerned about gas costs.
              <br/>
              You
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; would not need
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be concerned about electrical outages disrupting
              <br/>
              a

              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have used electricity some way in the operation

              of
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; the gas kiln.  Of

              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course local ordinances may have a negative impact.

              But
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; I would
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly look into the real cost of gas vs
              <br/>
              electricity.

              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generators -the Witte Generator was a popular brand.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; Pricey though but
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more efficient over all, and very dependable,  than
              <br/>
              gas
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; because the same
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fuel could be used to heat your house, and cook
              <br/>
              with,
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; and heat your hot
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water. Less of a fire hazard than gas. Easier to
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; transport because of
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reduced fire hazard.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wood: Local woods might be available if you check
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; around, so a wood fire
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kiln might be an option, although I expect there
              <br/>
              useable
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; wood would be
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very scarce.. Then there may be environmental
              <br/>
              concerns
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; as well as code
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Coal: Prol'ly out of the question
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I would certainly look into the real cost of gas
              <br/>
              vs
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; electricity.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless you are in a location where some other fuel
              <br/>
              is
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; convienently and
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inexpensively available electricity is probably
              <br/>
              going to
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; be the cheapest
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy available to you, regardless. In Alaska, in
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; certain areas along
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the coast, there is coal sticking up out of the
              <br/>
              ground
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; and sand. It's
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low grade, but it burns, and anyone with the will
              <br/>
              can go
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; to the beaches
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ansimply load theirs truck with it, come home and
              <br/>
              burn
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; it in their
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stove, kiln or what have you. That is about as cheap
              <br/>
              as
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; it gets. But for
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most of us any where in the country, even Hiwaii,
              <br/>
              and
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; even as expensive
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as it is there, electricity is going to be the
              <br/>
              cheapest
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; energy  going.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck on your quest to get up and running on
              <br/>
              firing.

              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hi,
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I will soon be ordering a Kress kiln and am very
              <br/>
              new
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; to this art. We
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; live in
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hawaii and and the cost of electricity is very
              <br/>
              high.
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; Is it possible to
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; run
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it off of say a 13000 KW generator?  My husband
              <br/>
              seems
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; to think it would
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;work. Any help on this subject would be greatly
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; appreciated. I cannot go
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; gas
              <br/>
              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;as way beyond my means so am stuck with electric.
