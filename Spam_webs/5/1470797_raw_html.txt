Cen A is marked by dramatic
   <a href="lib/glossary.html#dust">

   lanes that run across the galaxy's
center.  These dust lanes are so thick they almost completely obscure the
galaxy's center in visible light. Our
   <a href="http://www.eia.brad.ac.uk/btl/gy1.html">
    Milky Way Galaxy contains dust,
   </a>
   but not in the same proportion.  Cen A is also unusual compared to a
normal galaxy because it contains a higher proportion of young blue stars,
is a very strong source of radio emission, and has a unique structure.
Cen A is thought to be the result of the collision of two
