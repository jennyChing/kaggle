        In 2005, this writer penned 
        <a href="/drugs/marijuanaconspiracy">
         The Real Reason Marijuana is Illegal
        </a>
         and it became (by far) my most popular article. Translated into Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Swedish, Bulgarian and even Japanese, the responses were overwhelming. Its premise was marijuana became illegal NOT because it was a danger to the mind and body. No, the real reason is that Big Business wants us to use petrochemicals and fossil fuels. They have little interest in NATURAL solutions. THEY have suppressed the truth concerning cannabis and purposely created the menace of marijuana. Why? So they remain high profiteers while
        <a href="http://jahtruth.net/envird.htm">
         destroying our environment
        </a>
        in the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once people read the news of what has been kept from them, the truth, the reactions were outrage and disbelief at our federal authorities. Hemp used properly for all of its INDUSTRIAL purposes, as it was always meant to be utilized, could
        <br/>
        <br/>
        SAVE THE WORLD! We need not cut down another tree. We need not have to rely on Oil Companies anymore.
       </p>
       <p>
        So many people wrote to me and said the suppression of hemp is insane. Surely, governments know the potential of pot. They understand how cannabis hemp could solve the energy crisis; they know biodegradable plastics could be produced from the hemp plant; they realize it would be a safer, cleaner world filled with (inexpensive) quality productsif only we were federally given the green light to INDUSTRIALIZE HEMP! Governments are well aware of the MEDICINAL value for weed. New cloths, papers and plastics would be super durable. They could easily create nutritional FOOD products for a starving world. BUTwhen did a better mousetrap ever see the light of day?
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, with soaring gas prices bleeding us for every dollar inflating all prices, we need a cheap (renewable) fuel and energy source more than ever. Imagine hemp gas. The price of it would not be sky high since we have a limitless supply of hempen energy. Federal (guarded) hemp fields could be farmed and directed to produce a cheap/clean gasoline. Hemp fibers and oil were utilized during
        <a href="/myron#ww2">
         WWII
        </a>
        for rope-moorings, parachutes and lubrication. Why not use hemp gasoline NOW when we are at another critical point in time? Why does hemp technology remain clandestine?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is there a war in the Middle East over oil? Do you really think its a coincidence that George Bush is an oilman and remains steadfast against bringing our troops home? Hemp petroleum is the way to alleviate us from dependency on foreign oil. That is a wonderful dream, cannabis as the means to bring our troops home!

        Instead of THEM industrializing hemp to save the planetthey have banned it. They have created a monster out of the very thing that is a precious gift to the world. NO, it does not make sense at all. However, it is understandable in the insane, Bizarro, backwards world that we live in. Apparently, any good thing is always destroyed. (Ever hear of
        <a href="http://merlib.org/person/nikola-tesla">

        and you might understand.
       </p>
       <p>
        They invented the monster of MARIJUANA. (If we do not have an enemy, they will create one). They had to change the word since the world would never have been turned against HEMP. For thousands of years going back to the wisdom of the Egyptians, hemp was employed for the betterment of the human race. Enter marihuana in the 1930s; just when farm machinery improved that would have made hemp the first billion dollar crop!
       </p>
       <p>
        Have we grown up enough to see that they have pulled the wool over our eyes? We can no longer afford to be silent lambs. We have to speak up loud and strong and do what we can to spread the truth. What can we do? Share the information, wake people up to the true facts and suppressed knowledge concerning hemp. Eventually, when the pro-hemp people become the large majority, then, the world will change for the better. In the end, we will win.

        A very important aspect of those email responses to my original article came in the form of personal stories. These testimonials answer the question: Does hemp help or hurt? Now, this writer could not please everyone on such a controversial subject. Not all the emails contained high praise. There were those anti-hemp fanatics spouting rhetoric from every commercial from the Partnership of a Drug-Free America. Some stated it causes lung cancer as they tried to educate me on the toxins in marijuana.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, there are no toxins in hemp. I would love to tell Judge Judy, who is always yelling for someone to take a hair follicle test, the reason why THC stays in your system for so long. (And its hemp not marijuana). If it were a toxin, a poison or some foreign substance, the body would immediate reject it and expel it. The body does NOT. It knows THC, the active ingredient of hemp, is GOOD. As mentioned before, there are essential fatty acids in hemp seeds. There are other sources in nature for these essential acids, but eating hemp seeds is a great source of (important) proteins. Our own bodies tell us the truth. Shouldnt we listen to the truth within ourselves rather than the garbage broadcasted over television?

        Seriously, the pro emails compared to the con emails ran 100 to one. For every one who blasted me, calling me names (these were from mainly young people)there were about a HUNDRED administrators, educators, some scientists, activists and average people who related their (positive) private stories to me. Many claimed that normal medical procedures and doctors failed them miserably. The ONLY relief from their illnesses was illegal hemp. Here is a peek into some of the best and positive emails over the last two years. They are anonymous and edited, but they are real with the date I received them:

         I was diagnosed with an AVM (Arterio Venous Malformation), a neuro-illness that causes me to have fits. On my second appointment with my neuro surgeon we went through the list of narcotics I was using at the time (marijuana).

         I took a college class in drug use, it was about street drugs, not pharmaceutical drugs. I learned that, at one time, marijuana was legal and was prescribed by MDs and dispensedby pharmacists for a variety of health problems - you know: HTN, insomnia, glaucoma, asthma, etc. I was told that the government decided to impose a $25 tax on MDs who prescribed it and a $35 tax on pharmacists who dispensed it.In protest, both groups elected to stop dealing with it. In response, Pres. Harriman included marijuana in his Narcotics Act of 1914: It was called the Harriman Act. They lumped it in as a class 4 narcotic meaning that there was no medical use for it, even though it's not a narcotic and no one had any indication that it was harmful in any way. In the class, we were shown pictures, taken during the early part of the century, of children smoking a jointwhich, we were told, they could purchase for 5 cents, OTC,at any pharmacy, perfectly LEGAL - they were called muggles.

         You didn't mention the most important reason why there is a continuing battle against legalization of marijuana, that is because it actually is used to treat sick people with pain successfully and with no serious side effects, something the legal drug industry hasn't accomplished with all their patented expensive crap they call medication. They don't want to loose their chokehold on the billions of dollars they make with this phony medication that could be replaced with an herb anyone can grow in their backyard.

         I have a lot of respect for cannabis as I have used it medically for a
spinal injury for several years recently, when all else failed, as doctors gave me narcotic drugs to relieve pain, and these drugs never worked and I was in such severe pain even with their drugs. Cannabis was the only pain reliever that worked. I have done a bit of research myself and found that cannabis is listed under a narcotic and this must be taken off the list that the United States has placed it as narcotic as opium, heroin, cocaine is totally ridiculous and bogus. I feel that if it was taken off the list and proved to the DEA, FDA, or whoever elsethat it isn't a narcotic then we can get some headway on this wonderful, helpful plant. If it wasn't for cannabis I wouldn't have healed...The AMA is the worst, the most horrendous of all, because they encourage the doctors to prescribe drugs that lead to the deterioration of the body. Yes, it is a conspiracy, from the beginning, that the corporations don't want hemp to be grown. If they did, the logging industry would be wiped out. I live in southern Oregon and it is the biggest industry here

         I'm a 41 year oldvictim of Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disease that kills people usually around 32 years old. I have the worst type of genetic mutation butstill alive at the amazement of my Doctor. The reason? Maybe HEMP! I use it in a moderate way, around 2-3 timesa week, usually eating it, and the benefit of that medicine is very goodfor me. Cystic Fibrosis kills people by pneumonia. An effect of hemp is drying mucus secretion so it kills bacteria bystarvation. Even better:an antioxidant property of hemp that prevents lung tissue degradation. Anothercharacteristic of Cystic Fibrosis is destruction of the digestive system, especially pancreas, stomach, liver and intestine. That isappetiteinhibiting. I'm often eating because of holy hemp. Itavoids mefrom losing too much weight and helps my defense against the constant lung infection. If my doctor knew the truth, he'd surely start hemp harvestingfor sure!

         I am bipolar and when I smokeI am calmer thenI am on my pills. I also have fibromyalgia and when in pain I grab my trusty friend Pot; it helps me function and eat. If I didn't have it, I would be dead years ago. Some days I can hardly make it down the stairs because of the ache and pains in my joints. Also, I suffer from severe migraines where I can't even open my eyes because I am light sensitive then my head pounds. I have been on manynarcotics from vicodin to oxycottin and they all make me feel worse than smoking a damn joint. Only in America would they make a plant so beneficial to humankind, the most dangerous drug in all the land. If I didn't go score I would be in pain and would never be able to walk out to get my mail. My fianc gets upset since Ican't work but she knows I can'thelp it. I want to work. I want to be the breadwinner of the family, but physically I cannot maintain standing for more than a fewmoments before I feel likeI am passingout because of the pain. I went to numerous doctors and told them that pot helps meall of them said since I live in Ohio, they cannot do anything for me besides narcoticsbut I cannot smoke a jointthat is rubbish in my book.

         I don't know if you have thought about this before, but after all the research I have done, it is my opinion that JFK was assassinated over hemp. He was a known user for his back pain, he fired Anslinger as soon as he got into office and it was said he was going to legalize it in his 2nd term. He never made it to his 2nd term. Maybe you can dig a bit more on your end and see what you come up with to support this theory of mine. It makes sense, don't you think? Keep educating people one day at a timeit's our only shot.

         The actual truth that the oil giants do not want anyone to know is that most non producing oil fields (for example, Derrick Island off Louisiana) have been found to have mysteriously refilled themselves after closing them down. This is because the vast majority of oil is not biotic but abiotic. The planets crust produces billions of new gallons of crude annually and this is refilling the fields pumped out in almost every case. That is why Saudi Arabia just doubled the estimate of its known reserves over its predictions of 10 years ago. The wells keep refilling themselves due to planetary mechanics. Biotic oil is a discredited theory. There was never enough biomass in any prehistoric period to produce the amount of petroleum we have already consumed on this planet to date.

         Maybe by the time I retire I can smoke a joint in peace, not fearing the Police and my government. But, other times it just seems hopeless, but I refuse to believe that money is the most powerful force in our Universe...there must be some room for truth.

         I am a recreational therapist working for a state operated drug treatment center. If I were to speak in these terms, I doubt I would remain in favor of those above me.

         As a medical marijuana user for many years, I would not be here without it. I was a vegetable on the prescribed medication anddont remember 2 whole years of my life while I was on morphine. Now I live a full and active life, running a business and bringing up a family. Is it too late to change views? I do hope not because it has so much to offer.

        Above are some of the best comments from hundreds of replies. My article was far from perfect. I thank those more informed on plants than myself that told me there are other plants that physically reveal their sex such as the holly plant. Many criticized my belief that cannabis had an extraterrestrial origin. That conclusion came out of decades of studying our ancestors of prehistory. My studies have shown a completely new genesis for the human race where we have lost great knowledge. (It may have been advanced HUMANS that created Earthly animals and plants). Cannabis Sativa and all of its infinite and vital uses may be evidence that some great intelligence (with a plan) manufactured it. Chance cannot account for its abundant purposes. To some people, the existence of hemp might be proof of the existence of GOD! My website link explores multiple controversies and truths that will never be aired on television. Check it out:

        Writing about hemp, answering the emails and the entire Internet experience has taught me that there are all kinds of people. You cannot please everyone. What was brilliant to one person was contemptible to another. People think they know
        <a href="http://jahtruth.net/truth.htm">
         the truth
        </a>
        , but
        <a href="http://jahtruth.net/truth.htm">
         the truth
        </a>
        is they only know what they have been programmed to think. Very few people do independent research. Thats too much work; they prefer sitting back, watching
        <a href="/television/">
         TV
        </a>
        and letting others do their thinking for them. They do not QUESTION what has been handed them. But, if they did explore other possibilities outside of the norm...if they dreamed of a different worldand entertained the idea that we have been lied to by our leadersmaybe we would learn a little and come closer to the FREEDOM that we all rightfully deserve. A cleaner, safer planet will happen. It may not be soon, but it will happen in time

         My mother had 7 back surgeries, the doctors gave her an unbelievable list of serious drugs, after years of taking these, her body built up a tolerance toward the drugs that she took because the doctors told her to, (she trusted them), I begged her to stop and let me coach her with isometric exercises that I had been doing through a lifelong study of Chinese Gung Fu. I wrote up a plan that included the exercises, herbal medicines and weed.
        </p>
        <p>
         #1 she refused the exercises because the doctors brainwashed her into believing that she was beyond repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         #2 She did not have a belief in the success of herbal medicines (although they've been used for over 5000 years)
        </p>
        <p>
         #3 I suggested that she smoke weed for pain and relaxation. She refused this because it's illegal. I told her that she is exactly the type this Gov't loves, because she will trust and do everything they say. Well, my mother died of a massive stroke at the age of 55 due to the years of medication that had basically eaten away and damaged her internal organs.

        I was in an accident a few years ago and have been unable to work. Prior to said accident I was a regular pot smoker. Since then I have been unable to smoke because I get drug tested by the doctors that prescribe pain medicine! I have a broken pelvis and sacrum as well as some nerve damage. I have been on every narcotic there is over the last few years. While some take care of the minor pains NOTHING even touches the nerve pains. Luckily those pains are intermittant. I recently got my hands on some weed and smoked it. I smoked far less than what I smoked prior to the accident. Low and behold - IT WORKED VERY WELL ON THE PAIN ESPECIALLY THE NERVE PAIN! The best part was not being out of my mind - a side effect of the narcotics. Sure I was high but I can and do function very well while high. I managed to graduate from a private college, have a very successful career for ten years, had a nice house and a classic BMW M6 and best of all was married to a beautiful wonderful woman. Today I am divorced, can't work, have nothing(no house - no car - no money) and I live with my parents in a state that has very strict laws against marijuana and absolutely no medical marijuana. I hope to move to a state that has legalized medical marijuana soon. I absolutely hate feeling druged out of my mind and foggy brained from the narcotics. I wish so bad that I could just smoke weed to help with the pain. My sister and uncle both have MS and swear that marijuana helps their pain as well. Unfortunately my sister lives in the same state as I. My uncle does not and smokes regularly otherwise he would be wheelchair bound. But since he does smoke he is able to have a regular employment schedule. I really hope that once I do move to where medical marijuana is legal that I can go back to work. Meanwhile I lie here flat on my back as it's the only position that does not leave me in excrutiating pain. LEGALIZE!! HEMP IS THE WAY!

          Probably because the bankers won't make as much money off them as putting them into constant debt, so they'll create a crisis or a war and the "liberating" forces of the EU and the USA will come and bomb the shit outta them putting them back into debt and fossil fuels again.

         i cant quite find the words of how i feel. most likely cause i take the whole picture into question. if i write passionately about the controversy over marijuana, government conspiracies...does it matter? i dont know, they have tvs ALWAYS on their is always reached out and if u refuse they hit. we have to form a fist to take back something we never knew existed...i feel horrible because i can see my words, name, voice and sight fade away not one day but each day that is how i feel. Relenquishment; I recently had the pleasure of personally addressing one of the UN's head of securety, who was a very nice woman, i asked questions of what their doing to help africans and so on, she showed slides she looked emotionally distraught, we all felt sad 4 Africa. But after the class i asked for a moment f her time, we had coffee, i asked her questions about y not use marijuana to help Africa shit do it in secret, don't let NA know just fucking help them! Then with a serious look in her eyes she told me something that left me feeling frozen,'I'm surprised you have the courage to be so bold with these 'accusations',( i said what about this 'vchip' is that a lie! what about)"your smart, do you think were helping the people in Africa? she got up to leave.. do you think were helping you?...by looking at the coffee in my hand as she walked away with an Aquafina bottle none the less believe it or not im pissed off everyday, i smoke 4 i dont go crazy

        I'm surprised noone here has even mentioned the fact that hemp can cure cancer! That's right, and the powers that be have known since at least 1974! Google it. Type -Marijuana Cancer Cure- into any search engine and find out how hemp can either slow the growth of or even cure most cancers. Also check out the story of Rick Simpson, the man who cured his cancer patients using Hemp Oil.

        , I've seen first hand the disruptive potential of hard drugs and alcohol but I don't recall patients who's lives have been troubled by marijuana use. Even more, I've read several articles on how it can be used to treat cancer or relief chemo therapy symptoms. It also has a lot of industrial uses but for some reason, it is still illegal...
