   THE TYGER (from Songs Of Experience)
  </h2>
  <h3>
   By William Blake
  </h3>
  Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
  <br/>
  In the forests of the night,
  <br/>
  What immortal hand or eye
  <br/>
  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
  <br/>
  <p>
   In what distant deeps or skies
   <br/>
   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
   <br/>
   On what wings dare he aspire?
   <br/>
   What the hand dare sieze the fire?
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   And what shoulder, &amp; what art.
   <br/>
   Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
   <br/>
   And when thy heart began to beat,
   <br/>
   What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet?
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   What the hammer?  what the chain?
   <br/>
   In what furnace was thy brain?
   <br/>
   What the anvil?  what dread grasp
   <br/>
   Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   When the stars threw down their spears,
   <br/>
   And watered heaven with their tears,
   <br/>
   Did he smile his work to see?
   <br/>
   Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
   <br/>
   In the forests of the night,
   <br/>
   What immortal hand or eye
   <br/>
   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
   <br/>
