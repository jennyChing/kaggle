  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   Recent media reports
incorrectly stated that the location of the Four Corners survey monument 
marking the point common to Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah  is in
error by 2.5 miles and suggested that the monument therefore does not correctly
mark the intersection of the four states. These reports also erroneously
attributed the discovery of this supposed error to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administrations (NOAA) National Geodetic Survey (NGS).  NGS did not, in fact,
make any claim or pronouncement that the monument is incorrectly located or
suggest that it should be relocated.  NGS has, however, worked with the media
to correct inaccuracies in the initial reports, clarifying that the distance
between the actual location of the monument and its intended location is
substantially less than the reported 2.5 miles, and that  as affirmed by the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  it does indeed correctly mark the four-state-intersection
point.  Because NGS was specifically named in the reports, this brief document was
prepared to present some pertinent facts and history about the Four Corners
monument and its placement.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1875, a surveyor
named Chandler Robbins was contracted by the U.S. General Land Office (GLO),
the BLMs predecessor, to survey the entire boundary between the territories of
Arizona and New Mexico, from the U.S.-Mexico boundary to the 37
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   parallel of latitude north of the equator.  He was charged with also establishing,
at the boundarys northern terminus, the Four Corners monument, as it would be
known upon completion of the other territorial boundary surveys terminating there. 
 Robbins was directed to base his survey on the geographic coordinates of Ship
Rock (a prominent northwestern New Mexico landform), which had been determined
the previous year during the decade-long U. S. Geographical Surveys West of the
100
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   Meridian, led by First Lieutenant George Wheeler.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   An 1863 Act of Congress,
signed by President Lincoln, which separated Arizona from New Mexico, specified
that the dividing boundary should be coincident with the 32
   <sup>
    nd
   </sup>
   meridian
of longitude west of the Washington (DC) Meridian.  The Washington Meridian,
which had been in use since 1850, was defined as bisecting the dome of the old
Naval Observatory, situated at a longitude of 77 degrees 03 minutes West (for
simplicity, longitude values presented here are rounded to the nearest arc
minute).  In fact, the boundaries of 11 western states are similarly longitude-referenced
to the Washington Meridian, and not the Greenwich Meridian.  This practice was
in place in the U.S. until 1912, when our nation adopted Greenwich as its
standard longitude reference.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">
   Hence, what Congress
had specified for the Arizona-New Mexico boundary, and the Four Corners
monument, was that they should be established at a longitude of 109 degrees 03 minutes
West, as referenced to the Greenwich Meridian.  Therein, we believe, lies the
source of the invalid report of a Four Corners monument location error of 2.5
miles.  Some people apparently relied on the incorrect premise that the marker was
originally intended to be located at a longitude of exactly 109 degrees West.   But,
Robbins followed his marching orders correctly, and the Four Corners monument
was established at the point he determined, to the very best of his ability and
using the available technology, to be the prescribed location of 109 degrees 03
minutes West longitude and 37 degrees North latitude.  There, his meridian
survey intersected the 1868 New Mexico-Colorado boundary survey, which ran
along the 37
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   parallel.  Subsequent surveys established the
Utah-Colorado and Arizona-Utah boundaries, thereby completing the Four Corners assemblage
of territorial (eventually state) lines, as specified by Congress.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   It is interesting to
note that, upon completion of his Arizona-New Mexico boundary survey, Chandler
Robbins went to the effort to write a letter to the editor of
   <i>
    The Santa Fe
New Mexican
   </i>
   (still todays daily newspaper) explaining the very issue of the
difference between longitude values referenced to the Greenwich Meridian and
those referenced to the Washington Meridian.  In this letter of November 1, 1875,
Robbins included the following explanation:
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">
   <i>
    It seems to have
been the general impression that the line was the 109 degrees of longitude west
of Greenwich. Such is not the case, as the law makes it 32 degrees of longitude
west from Washington, which corresponds to 109 degrees 02 minutes 59.25 seconds
west from Greenwich, and which places the line a small fraction less than three
miles farther west than would have been the case if it had been run as the 109
degrees of longitude.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   In these few words, Robbins takes
the mystery out of a technical issue that has evidently confused and misled some
people for more than a century.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   Nonetheless, there
remains the question of how close the Four Corners monument is relative to its
   <i>
    intended
   </i>
   location.  In fact, there is a discrepancy between the actual location, which
we know to a high degree of accuracy, and our best knowledge of where it was
intended to be located.  But, instead of a 2.5-mile discrepancy, as reported in
the initial news items, this offset is in fact only about 1800 feet, or less.  Not
only is the offset only about one-tenth of the alleged location error, it is in
the opposite direction; the intended monument location is west of the actual monument. 
There is, however, uncertainty in precisely quantifying the relationship
between the intended and actual monument locations due to changes, since 1875,
in some technical details of the geodetic reference systems utilized.  The actual
offset might in fact be considerably less than our estimate.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   Regardless of the
technical nuances, we can confidently say that, considering the relatively
primitive surveying technology of the day, the remote and difficult prevailing field
conditions, and uncertainty in the surveys beginning coordinates for Ship Rock,
Chandler Robbins survey was a resounding success.  He nailed the location of
the Four Corners, to the best of his ability, using the tools and information available
to him at the time.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   Finally, we cannot
overemphasize the fact that the aforementioned technical geodetic details are
absolutely moot when considering any question of the correctness or validity of
the Four Corners monument in marking the intersection of the four states. 
Indeed, the monument marks the
   <i>
    exact
   </i>
   spot where the four states meet.  A
basic tenet of boundary surveying is that once a monument has been established
and accepted by the parties involved (in the case of the Four Corners monument,
the parties were the four territories and the U.S. Congress), the location of
the physical monument is the ultimate authority in delineating a boundary. 
Issues of legality trump scientific details, and the intended location of the
point becomes secondary information.  In surveying, monuments rule!
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   The physical monument
marking the Four Corners has been rebuilt multiple times by the GLO and BLM over
the years since Robbins installed a seven-foot-tall sandstone shaft to mark the
spot.  But the same location has been perpetuated now for more than a century
and a quarter.  The current monument complex was constructed in 1992 and
includes a visitor plaza area surrounding a commemorative survey disk.  The
Four Corners monument has been included in modern high-accuracy Global
Positioning System (GPS) geodetic surveys, producing three-dimensional
coordinates accurate to an inch or better.  These survey results and
descriptive information about the monument are included in the database of geodetic
control points maintained by NGS.  The geodetic control datasheet for the Four
Corners monument (designation: CO UT AZ NM) can be found online here:
   <a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=AD9256">
    http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=AD9256
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   Hence, in addition to
marking the intersection point of four states, the Four Corners monument is
also a component of what is known today as the National Spatial Reference
System (NSRS), which is maintained by NGS and serves as the nations geospatial
framework.  Through its published geodetic position, the monument provides a
mechanism for geospatial professionals (land surveyors, engineers, etc.) to
access this framework with a high degree of both accuracy and certainty.  The
Four Corners monument continues its long-standing heritage of playing an
important role in the history and demarcation of the American West  all the
while bearing witness as the only point of intersection of four U.S. states  in
exactly the right place.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
   NGS is responsible
for defining, maintaining, and providing public access to the NSRS  a
consistent national coordinate system that provides the foundation for mapping
and charting; some state boundaries; transportation, communication, and land
records systems; as well as scientific and engineering applications.  More
information about NGS and the various components of the NSRS can be found at:

   .  NGS is not
normally involved in boundary-related issues and is providing the information contained
in this document simply as a statement of clarification of the pertinent facts
and background regarding the Four Corners monument.   The field notes and plats
