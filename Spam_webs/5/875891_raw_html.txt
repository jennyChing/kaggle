       His publicist revealed
      </b>
      the star had been 'battling severe depression of late.'
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Robin also admitted that he was troubled by his finances. He was reportedly forced to pay $30million during his 2008 divorce from his second wife Marsha Garces, the film producer who is mother to his last two children, and first wife Valerie Velardi.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Robin admitted he returned to TV after nearly three decades because two divorces have left him short of cash. The comic's breakups cost him 30million and he claims to need a 'steady job'. He was also selling his $30 million California ranch due to his sizeable alimony payments.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Williams said: 'Divorce is expensive. I used to joke they were going to call it "all the money", but they changed it to "alimony". 'It's ripping your heart out through your wallet.'
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His marriage to Valerie Velardi ended in 1988 after the pair had been together for 10 years. The actor then wed his son's nanny Marsha Garces with whom he stayed for 19 years and had two children with. The couple divorced in 2008. Williams is now married to graphic designer, Susan Schneider.

       Robin Williams' tragic death
      </b>
      at age 63 came as a shock to the world who knew him only as a lovable comic figure. But a source close to the Mrs. Doubtfire star tells RadarOnline.com that in addition to his addiction struggle, the actor recently confided to a family friend that he had "serious money troubles," and was worried about his family's financial security.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      According to a family friend who had spoken to Williams recently, "All he could talk about were serious money troubles. There were clearly other issues going on and Robin sounded distant during the telephone conversation. Robin was known for being so generous to his friends and family during the height of his success, and would help anyone out that needed it."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "There was also frustration that Robin expressed at having to take television and movie roles he didn't want to take, but had to for the paycheck," the source said, referencing his recently announced decision to film
      <i>
       Mrs. Doubtfire 2
      </i>
      . "Doing sequels was never Robin's thing, and he wasn't that excited at having to reprise the role of Mrs. Doubtfire, which was scheduled to start filming later this year."

       (left, Williams with Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Crazy Ones, cancelled after one season)
       <br/>
      </i>
      <br/>
      He also recently worked on
      <i>
       Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb
      </i>
      , the third installment in that franchise.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In addition, Williams revealed in a Parade Magazine interview last year, that he took a role on the now-defunct CBS show
      <i>
       The Crazy Ones
      </i>
      because he needed the paycheck.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "The idea of having a steady job is appealing," Williams told the magazine. "There are bills to pay. My life has downsized, in a good way."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I'm selling the ranch up in Napa," he said of his $35 million Villa Sorriso. "I just can't afford it anymore."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Though Williams had one of Hollywood's most enduring careers, divorce -- from first wife Valerie Velardi in 1988, and from second wife, Marsha Garces in 2008 -- had gutted his bank account.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Divorce is expensive," he recently said. "I used to joke they were going to call it 'all the money', but they changed it to 'alimony'. It's ripping your heart out through your wallet."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With financial pressures weighing, the insider said that the cancellation of
      <i>
       The Crazy Ones
      </i>
      in May sent him spiraling.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Robin slipped into a deep depression," the source said. "He felt embarrassed and humiliated that the show had been a failure. It was very hard for Robin to accept. Here he was in his sixties, and forced to take a role on television for the money. It's just not where he thought he would be at this point in his life."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Williams is survived by third wife, Susan Schneider, and three children, Zachary Pym, 31, from his first wife, Velardi, daughter, Zelda, 25, and son, Cody, 25, from his second marriage to Garces.

       First Comment from W:
      </b>
     </font>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font style="font-size: 1.25em;">
      I turn 70 in two days. I was raised by a single Mom on welfare. I was taught a very strong work ethic by my Mom (who got off welfare and worked as a nurses aid).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      By the time I reached the age of 35 I had the money to retire. Subsequently I went through two divorces with two children each time. Both of my former wives were monogamously challenged. Had California not changed to a no fault divorce state, my two X wives would have gotten nothing from me, and I would have had sole custody of the children. This would have been justice and salvation for me and my kids.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have been remarried to a wonderful woman for 18 years. She is the total opposite of both of my X's (neither one of which has remarried). The two divorces devastated my finances and my four children suffered. Children are nothing more than a pawn in California divorce courts, used to extract more money and suffering from the unfortunate husband and father. My oldest son died in 2005. He had a drug problem that he would not have had if California had not changed to no fault divorce. In fact under Mosaic law in the Old Testament both my X wives would have been stoned to death. An irrelevant fact and yet a glimpse into the mind and heart of God. When my current wife and I were married I had lost everything and gone through bankruptcy. We started over from below zero assets.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Today my wife and I are successful business owners and respected pillars of our community. My wife was raised by a single Mom also and came to me with basically nothing in the way of finances. Had God not put her in my life, I very likely would have ended up like Robin Williams. I was severely depressed when she came into my life and had basically given up on life.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The court system and divorce laws in California are an atrocity and an offense to God and mankind. The set up is only about attorneys and ex-wives taking the poor unfortunate husband and father to the cleaners. The mind set is not only to break the poor slob financially, but also to destroy him in every other way possible. Many other states are no better.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My life was saved by my 3rd wife and my Lord and savior Jesus Christ. I want to encourage any man reading this who is going through divorce. Try to hang in there. Your children need their Dad and will need you more in the years to come as they get older. I don't want to try to make this sound easy, it is not. Please be encouraged by what God and a very good woman have done for me.

        As usual, an excellent mosaic of the different writers, especially W. who has justly been rewarded by GOD's hand.  His story is so wholesome and filled with compassion, all of us should take inspiration from him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the writers are very harsh judging and classifying this certainly great artist, no doubt about that, without shining a light on his depressing environment of upbringing which was anything but loving, so cold and almost inhuman on behalf of his father and deprecating attitude of his mother - the perfect atmosphere to create an unbalanced kid longing for love and warmth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The divorce law is one more measure by these satanic zionist destroyers to take down the family and enrich the
        <br/>
        disproportionate number of khazar lawyers.
       </p>
       <p>
        See the fine and emotional eulogy of Stefan Molyneux, he is a wonderful man with a penetrating view into Robin Williams' psyche.

        Robin Williams was an entertainer and one of his skills was to make us think we knew him.  That is what they do and get paid lots of money to put on a show. But, we do not know them as who they really are, and if we did, we might actually find them offensive. Most of them seem like spoiled-brats, quite shallow and in need of a lot of spiritual help.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Celebrities are part of the illusion used to keep people in a passive, semi-conscious state. Being a part of that machine / mechanism that keeps the masses asleep is not good at all.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some have compared fame to a drug and the adulation and applause is a strong addiction. Entertainers were once considered servants of society. They have become idols and gods.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I cannot comment on Robin Williams. Im familiar with his work, but did not know him.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Nevertheless, a sad end.

        re. JG below--I was a big fan of Del Shannon's although I was born in the late '60s, which was after most of his hits. I agree he was an awesome recording artist. I do disagree that he committed suicide. I remember like it was yesterday when Del Shannon died. I was driving home from class (college) and heard on the radio the bad news.  I really don't think he committed suicide but he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his gun. He was careless and killed himself by accident. I doubt he was in emotional distress at all. It was an accident and that's all it was.

        Hi. Henry. I enjoyed reading the article on Robin Williams and his divorce woes. One would have to think that the alimony laws that favor women in most cases,  and his crippling alimony had an impact on his emotional well-being. Your website theme " Save the Males" couldn't be more pertinent here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the behavior of  some women in society and their ability to abuse power just seems to be out of control and getting worse. I live in Alberta and had to put up with a Premier (Allison Redford) who clearly demonstrated what kind of cocktail you get when you mix an x chromosome , divorced lawyer, power and access to a lot of money. (who also attended Builderberg meetings btw.)
       </p>
       <p>
        In some cases, the price of fame can be too high, as Robin Williams likely illustrated, especially when it appears that most of his fortunes were likely spent by his ex- wives and divorce lawyers. Tragic loss.

        I think Robin's problems may have gone far beyond being despondent over costly past divorce settlements and a recent reduction to a television sit com that  failed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As it has been said, "no one knows another man's deeps".
       </p>
       <p>
        This suicide kind of reminds me of the late Del Shannon who did the great early sixties 45', 'Hats off to Larry'. I loved that song and burned the vinyl off that piece of hard rubber when I was a kid. I was shocked and disappointed to hear that he joined the long list of Californian celebrities that committed suicide over reportedly being despondent about not making the 'Rock and Roll' hall of fame.
       </p>
       <p>
        The life of " ease and luxury" can often distant ourselves from God. And when that happens we become a slave to our professions and addictions.

        I just read the comments about Robin Williams...I am stunned. The man's politics should
        <br/>
        be irrelevant. He was obviously a very funny guy...Good Morning Vietnam...He was also
        <br/>
        a very fine actor...Dead Poets Society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where is the common sense and sense of proper decorum in this terrible situation.
        <br/>
        Much of the comments were mean spirited, insensitive and to some extent incoherent. People have evidently changed. Robin's daughter shut her social media account down due to upsetting comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is it Henry with people today? They act and sound like heartless savages. I have
        <br/>
        theory as to the why...Hollywood, video games, pornography, prescription drugs,
        <br/>
        and to much affluence, etc. etc. They sound and act like spoiled, hard hearted, selfish, empty shells of what human beings once were like.

        Henry, I'm too old for Williams.  To me he was just an overly intense, cheap copy of Johnathan Winters and not nearly as original or funny.  Winters himself was not very funny sometimes with his off-the-cuff skits.  Plus Winters never designed his skits to push his political beliefs.  So sick of that.  Williams' passing to me is just the end to another round of ultra juvenile "entertainment."

        Robin Williams, poster boy for alimony related death?
       </p>
       <p>
        Listen:  Williams was a self confessed bipolar manic depressive.  He exceeded the average life expectancy for men with his disorders by 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Has anybody noticed that he died during the 'Supermoon' over LA? *
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        According to his lawyer, accountant, and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet Williams was solvent.   Don't say he killed himself because of alimony - please don't.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll grant you that depression may not be the answer either.   Williams was chronic depressive, but he was used to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Still,  I wasn't surprised to hear them say Robin Williams committed suicide.   It was when I heard he'd cut his wrist, then hung himself, I was unconvinced.   I'm always suspicious when a wealthy celebrity that has access to painless euphoric drugs is reported to have have suicided themselves with knives, guns, jumping off buildings or hanging.  Those are awful ways to die.
       </p>
       <p>
        Real suicides I've known used to talk about how great it would be to go to sleep and not wake up - and that's exactly how they died. I think they always give friends clues how they'd do it.

        boo hoo, he had to go back to work to make millions acting like a coked up idiot. i dont want to talk about the dead but he was a typical leftist, untalented (subjective i know) and lucky to work at all considering this lack of talent and the many struggling, especially artists and non-illuminati entertainers. sure he had a good movie or two, but overall, its the same stupid character. never was a fan, and have little sympathy for people having to go to work basically just acting like an idiot.

        having been in the high life and homeless and everywhere in between, and had to go from waking at noon for breakfast in bed and caviar to working as a janitor and landscaper, what en ego it must be to be insulted you have to lower your artistic (hmmm) standards and do a sequel or a tv show.

        I feel terribly for Robin Williams, and have great respect for his contributions.
        <br/>
        Tragically, he alienated his loved ones with the use of drugs and with infidelity. Once you break up your family due to infidelity, it cannot be undone.
        <br/>
        I mean no disrespect or argument with the facts, but many times men who do this find themselves later in life with a great deal of regret and sorrow, though I have no idea what he was feeling, but I wish he and his family members the best.
