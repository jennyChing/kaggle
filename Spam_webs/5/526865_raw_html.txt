            Wars are costly in terms of lives and resources  so why have we fought them throughout human history? In modern times, states may fight wars for a number of complex reasons. But in the past, most tribal wars were fought for the most basic resources: goods, territory, and women.

           These reproduction-enhancing resources prompted our ancestors to fight in order to pass down their family genes. With war as a driving force for survival, an interesting pattern occurred, according to a new study. People with certain warrior-like traits were more likely to engage in and win wars, and then passed their warrior genes down to their children, which  on an evolutionary timescale  made their tribe even more warrior-like. In short, humans seem to have become more aggressive over time due to wars essential benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
           In their study, Stanford University scientists Laurent Lehmann and Marcus Feldman have presented a model showing that aggressive traits in males may have evolved as an adaptation to limited reproductive resources. Because tribal war serves as a method for appropriating territory and women, war may have driven the evolution of these traits.
          </p>
          <p>
           The scientists use the term belligerence to refer to a trait that increases the probability that the persons tribe will attack another tribe. Likewise, bravery refers to a trait that increases the probability that the persons tribe will win a war, whether they have attacked or are being attacked.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lehmann and Feldman demonstrate in their model that belligerence and bravery continue to genetically evolve through the male line. When one tribe conquers another, males in the conquering group mate with females in the conquered group, and pass the warrior traits to their male offspring.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suppose that for some reason or another each individual in a population is committed through genetic or cultural influence to go to war with probability 0.5, Lehmann told
           <i>
            PhysOrg.com
           </i>
           . Now in one group, an individual appears that is willing to go to war with probability 0.6, which, statistically, will increase his group to go to war. The genes or cultural variants causing individuals to go to war with probability 0.6 may then invade the population (because their bearer and their group members will produce more offspring and send more genetic or cultural variants in the next generation than individuals expressing the probability 0.5 to go war, and on average they will transmit to their offspring the tendency 0.6 to go to war), but this will take several generations, especially if belligerence or bravery is genetically determined.
          </p>

           <ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-format="auto" data-ad-slot="5350699939" style="display:block">

           </script>
          </div>
          <p>
           Once the probability 0.6 is fixed in the population, a value of 0.7 is more likely to invade than a decrease to 0.5. So it is true that there is gradual, step-by-step evolutionary process causing the increment in the tendency to go to war, but this might take a long time. Our model is a bit less idealized than this, but it works approximately like that.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, as you might expect, there is a downside to belligerence and bravery. While both these traits offer advantages during war for a tribe, both traits are also considered high-risk social behaviors. An individual possessing the traits has a greater chance of dying, which means the tribe not only loses a warrior, but the death also opens a spot for another male to appropriate the first males reproduction-enhancing resources.
          </p>
          <p>
           This trade-off leads to another question: if an individual himself does not benefit from belligerence and bravery, but only his tribe, why would humans evolve this altruistic trait? The scientists explain that the answer is kinship: a human will take the risk of dying for close relatives since they carry very similar genetic material, and will pass that genetic material on for him.
          </p>
          <p>
           The mathematical analysis in fact shows that the selective pressure on belligerence and bravery is substantially driven by the benefits of conquest that accrue on the relatives of the belligerent and/or brave males within their group, showing that kinship ties shape warfare in our model, Lehmann said. Evolutionary biologists refers to this as indirect transmission of genes because the individual expressing the trait does not reproduce (it's in fact costly for him), but other individuals from the group who survive may indirectly benefit from the behavior of the possibly dead brave male.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lehmann added that the genetic relatedness concept stems from the late Bill Hamilton of Oxford University, one of the greatest evolutionary biologists of the 20th century. Prior to Hamilton, the British geneticist J. B. S Haldane also hit upon the idea in a famous anecdote. When asked by a friend at a pub whether he would risk his life to save a drowning man, Haldane scribbled some notes on a napkin and answered, No, but I would do it for two brothers or eight cousins."
          </p>
          <p>
           The same idea holds true for the altruistic traits of belligerence and bravery, but Lehmann and Feldman were surprised to find just how large a group could show the kinship connection.
          </p>
          <p>
           [The greatest significance of this study is] showing that the selective pressure on belligerence and bravery may remain substantial even in groups of large size (approximately 50 males and 50 females), Lehmann said. This is interesting because it is usually assumed that individually costly, altruistic traits (of which belligerence and bravery are only particular examples) would only be able to evolve in very small-sized groups, like the nuclear family or something only slightly bigger. The demographics behind warfare may explain the evolution of altruism in larger groups than have usually been assumed in more standard biological scenarios aimed at understanding the evolution of altruism.
          </p>
          <p>
           Among other interesting results of the model is the finding that bravery is even more highly desired than belligerence, since bravery has advantages when tribes are on both the offensive and defensive sides. On a different note, even though the model describes genetic inheritance, the scientists say that these traits could also be inherited culturally (through nurture rather than nature).
          </p>
          <p>
           Todays modern wars between large states, as opposed to tribal wars, dont follow the same model. Rather, one of the most common explanations is that modern wars are fought when the benefits outweigh the costs, in a fairly rational way. But do the results of this study, showing that we are all offspring of conquerors, suggest an underlying primitive explanation for why we fight rational modern wars? Though it may be an intriguing idea, Lehmann doesnt think so.
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't think that our study helps in one way or another to understand war between states, but there are many interesting and relevant theories for understanding such wars that have been developed by economists and political scientists, he said.

            If you look at societies not much has changed, they've simply grown in size.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So instead of having a small tribe of my surname or the location we're from, I have a huge tribe of "Americans." So instead of tribalism you have nationalism. Same thing, larger group.

            The ancient Incas had a ritual called "tying back the sun"  they did it to prevent the eventuality of the earth spinning closer and closer to the sun over the next millions of years.  they thought they could effect a change for the better and save the earth a few years, without any thought to whether it was their fault that it was slowly being sucked into the suns gravitational pull.  who really cares if it is warming, cooling, our fault or natural?  why not just clean up the mess?  surely everyone can agree that pollution is a bad thing.  not one person has ever tried stopping me from mopping the floor - not my scientist husband or my religious mom.  lets all agree to less mess.

             <br/>
             <br/>
             What do those numbers represent? Can you provide source?

            <br/>
            <br/>
            Do the math. CO2 is at max absorption of IR within 10 meters of it's source at a concentration of 280 ppm.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The distance from the earth to the tropopause is 16km at the equator and about 8km at the poles.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since CO2 has a logarithmic relationship you can double the amount of CO2 and it will only absorb 50% more IR per concentration. Conversely if you half the amount of CO2 it will travel twice the distance before being absorbed.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So for IR to be able to orginate at the earth and escape the troposphere without being absorbed, the concentration at the equator would have to be less than 0.0038 ppm. At the poles less than 0.0076ppm.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You get these numbers by dividing the amout of CO2 by 2 until you reach a distance of absorption of 16km at the equator or 8km at the poles. Since human kind can only be attributed with 0.3% of the total CO2 in the environment then removing the 0.3% will reduce absorption by about 3 dm, that's it.

            You said 'do the math'. Would you care to mention what exactly are the physical tehories and mathematical equations behind your assertion? I have hard time understanding what you mean, but that may well be because english is not my first language.

            According to satellite observations of outgoing IR radiation, the greenhouse effect has intensified:

            All this humans v.s. animals fighting wars debate is pretty silly. Don't try to impose human morals on animals, you might not like what you find. Cannibalism of the young (even in "higher" creatures). Preference for killing the old, sick, and the young over the healthy strong males able to fight back and run fast.
            <br/>

            Nature is incredibly vicious and HAS NO SENSE OF MORALITY. It doesn't make any judgements, or hold any war crimes trials, or care about genocide. It simply is what it is.

            Oh and as someone living close to Yellowstone park I can tell you that wolves don't tolerate competition. Within two years of the Gray Wolf introduction into the park the coyote population was down at least 50%, this was due to competition AND predation. In fact there were dens of coyotes found with all the pups dead but NOT eaten. A clear case of killing for a reason other than wanting a meal if I've ever heard of one.

            Gmurphy: CO2 levels in the 70's were 260ppm. CO2 levels now are 280ppm. That is not 1/3. Man made CO2 has a 1/3 of a percent contribution to the total atmostpheric co2. 99.7 % of CO2 is created by rotting plant matter, volcanic eruption, and other normal Earth processes.

            Rute: The math above follows the laws of IR absorption as measured by the UN IPCC and confirmed by infrared spectometrists according to the laws of IR energy absorption lain out in Chemistry, Spectomotry, and Physics.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Also your article doesn't measure the whole equation. If the Earth's visible light albedo rose then you would see a marked decrease in IR due to the fact it is not being produced. You're also discounting the fact that CO2 doesn't absorb IR across all ranges, only across 3 small increments. So your article is not in-depth enough to prove anything as it doesn't find a cause for the lack of IR detected. It creates the supposition that it must be CO2 and it must be man-made with no underlying reason. That makes it opinion, not fact.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Rute again: Every territorial pack animal in existance wages war agaist it's competition. All predators do for the most part as long as the cost is not high enough to preclude the fight.

            <br/>
            Fighting the CO2 global warming fight is a losing battle for you guys, the science doesn't support CO2 as the perpetrator of AGW.

            Now do I believe that the planet is warming, yes I do. Do I believe humanity is responsible, no I don't. We're too small to make that great a change on an environment that has endured far greater stress and duress than the human race could create.

Yes, rotting plants exhale CO2, but without that process we wouldn't have practically any CO2 in the atmosphere, because all of the plant CO2 would form deposits in the ground.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Volcanos produce fossil CO2, but there haven't been enough large eruptions lately which would explain the steady cumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Actually there have been relatively few volcanic eruptions in the 20th century.

            Ok so I'll do the math for you then:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            280 ppm = 10 m/absorption.
            <br/>
            The relation ship between CO2 levels and absorption is logarithmic so as you double co2, it reduces distance by 50%. Conversely if you cut CO2 in half you double the distance of absorption saturation. So cut co2 in half
            <br/>
            140ppm=20m
            <br/>
            70ppm=40m
            <br/>
            35ppm=80m
            <br/>
            17.5ppm=160m
            <br/>
            continue the trend until you reach 16km and that is the CO2ppm you need at the equator for IR to escape the tropopause without being absorbed.

            Right, but it doesn't include past cloud cover, past landscape albedo, concentration increase, concentration increase of the supposed AGW components and the relationship to the IR.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            They are observations without experimentation. Our atmosphere is far more complex that "Hey we see more IR it must be AGW."

            Where did they measure it, from inside the atmosphere? From a satellite located on the exterior of the tropopause? What was the ionizing solar activity like during the measurements? There is no substance to their statement.

             Do the math. CO2 is at max absorption of IR within 10 meters of it's source at a concentration of 280 ppm.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The distance from the earth to the tropopause is 16km at the equator and about 8km at the poles.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Since CO2 has a logarithmic relationship you can double the amount of CO2 and it will only absorb 50% more IR per concentration. Conversely if you half the amount of CO2 it will travel twice the distance before being absorbed.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So for IR to be able to orginate at the earth and escape the troposphere without being absorbed, the concentration at the equator would have to be less than 0.0038 ppm. At the poles less than 0.0076ppm.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             You get these numbers by dividing the amout of CO2 by 2 until you reach a distance of absorption of 16km at the equator or 8km at the poles. Since human kind can only be attributed with 0.3% of the total CO2 in the environment then removing the 0.3% will reduce absorption by about 3 dm, that's it.
            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You don't understand the issue, yes the level of CO2 is such that all IR radiation emitted on Earth's surface is absorbed by CO2 in the atmosphere before it reaches the space.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Thats true but that doesn't mean that increasing CO2 does not increase Earth's temperature.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The mechanism of greenhouse effect of CO2 is that increasing CO2 concentration leads to infrared energy (=heat, emitted by black body radiation of objects on Earth's surface) being absorbed closer to Earth's surface, and the closer absorption occurs the longer (more cycles of reemission and absorption) it will take that energy to escape into space.
            <br/>
            The longer it takes, the less effective Earth's cooling and the higher its temperature.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Seriously if you want to debunk something make sure you first understand it, otherwise you only spread disinformation and theres too much of that already.
            <br/>

            Not true. From the Volcano Hazards Program of US Geological Survey:
            <br/>
            "Scientists have calculated that volcanoes emit between about 130-230 million tonnes (145-255 million tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (Gerlach, 1999, 1991). This estimate includes both subaerial and submarine volcanoes, about in equal amounts. Emissions of CO2 by human activities, including fossil fuel burning, cement production, and gas flaring, amount to about 27 billion tonnes per year (30 billion tons) [ ( Marland, et al., 2006) - The reference gives the amount of released carbon (C), rather than CO2, through 2003.]. Human activities release more than 130 times the amount of CO2 emitted by volcanoes--the equivalent of more than 8,000 additional volcanoes like Kilauea (Kilauea emits about 3.3 million tonnes/year)! (Gerlach et. al., 2002)"

             You're joking right?
            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            No I'm not. As the US Geological Survey page points out, there would need to be about 8000 additional Kilauea volcanoes to produce the amount of CO2 humans do per year.

              You haven't shown any math yet, just some separate numbers. Tell me about the mathematic formula of a theory which you base your assertions on.
             </blockquote>
             Ok so I'll do the math for you then:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             280 ppm = 10 m/absorption.
             <br/>
             The relation ship between CO2 levels and absorption is logarithmic so as you double co2, it reduces distance by 50%. Conversely if you cut CO2 in half you double the distance of absorption saturation. So cut co2 in half
             <br/>
             140ppm=20m
             <br/>
             70ppm=40m
             <br/>
             35ppm=80m
             <br/>
             17.5ppm=160m
             <br/>
             continue the trend until you reach 16km and that is the CO2ppm you need at the equator for IR to escape the tropopause without being absorbed.
            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            I repeat my question: what is the physical theory and exact formula that you use to make that assertion?
            <br/>
            <br/>

               You're also discounting the fact that CO2 doesn't absorb IR across all ranges, only across 3 small increments. So your article is not in-depth enough to prove anything as it doesn't find a cause for the lack of IR detected.
              </blockquote>
              <br/>
              That's not true. The article clearly states that the decrease of IR radiation has specifically been observed on the wavelengths which the anthropogenic greenhouse gases absorb it.
              <br/>
             </blockquote>
             Right, but it doesn't include past cloud cover, past landscape albedo, concentration increase, concentration increase of the supposed AGW components and the relationship to the IR.
            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            Are you saying that changes in ground use and cloud cover would produce similar changes in the wavelength of outgoing IR radiation as increased levels of CO2, methane and ozone?

            That's not what they say at all. The peak IR absorption wavelengths of CO2 have been measured in laboratory.

            Do you think chimps make war on each other? If you do then your definition is flawed...they don't kill each other in large numbers with respect to us. This issue by it's very nature is relative, thus you're treading very closely to a strawman argument here.

            That pretty much fits the definition I have of animal war, thanks. However, I haven't heard of dingos, fishes or gorillas behaving similarily (has to do with the original claim of Velanarris). That is not to claim they don't 'wage war', it's just that I'd like to see some documented cases of it.

              Do the math. CO2 is at max absorption of IR within 10 meters of it's source at a concentration of 280 ppm.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The distance from the earth to the tropopause is 16km at the equator and about 8km at the poles.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Since CO2 has a logarithmic relationship you can double the amount of CO2 and it will only absorb 50% more IR per concentration. Conversely if you half the amount of CO2 it will travel twice the distance before being absorbed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So for IR to be able to orginate at the earth and escape the troposphere without being absorbed, the concentration at the equator would have to be less than 0.0038 ppm. At the poles less than 0.0076ppm.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              You get these numbers by dividing the amout of CO2 by 2 until you reach a distance of absorption of 16km at the equator or 8km at the poles. Since human kind can only be attributed with 0.3% of the total CO2 in the environment then removing the 0.3% will reduce absorption by about 3 dm, that's it.

             <br/>
             <br/>
             You don't understand the issue, yes the level of CO2 is such that all IR radiation emitted on Earth's surface is absorbed by CO2 in the atmosphere before it reaches the space.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Thats true but that doesn't mean that increasing CO2 does not increase Earth's temperature.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The mechanism of greenhouse effect of CO2 is that increasing CO2 concentration leads to infrared energy (=heat, emitted by black body radiation of objects on Earth's surface) being absorbed closer to Earth's surface, and the closer absorption occurs the longer (more cycles of reemission and absorption) it will take that energy to escape into space.
             <br/>
             The longer it takes, the less effective Earth's cooling and the higher its temperature.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Seriously if you want to debunk something make sure you first understand it, otherwise you only spread disinformation and theres too much of that already.

              You don't seem to understand that the amount of CO2 that humans produce is far and away inconsequential in regard to the perceived warming of the planet.

             Not true. From the Volcano Hazards Program of US Geological Survey:
             <br/>
             "Scientists have calculated that volcanoes emit between about 130-230 million tonnes (145-255 million tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (Gerlach, 1999, 1991). This estimate includes both subaerial and submarine volcanoes, about in equal amounts. Emissions of CO2 by human activities, including fossil fuel burning, cement production, and gas flaring, amount to about 27 billion tonnes per year (30 billion tons) [ ( Marland, et al., 2006) - The reference gives the amount of released carbon (C), rather than CO2, through 2003.]. Human activities release more than 130 times the amount of CO2 emitted by volcanoes--the equivalent of more than 8,000 additional volcanoes like Kilauea (Kilauea emits about 3.3 million tonnes/year)! (Gerlach et. al., 2002)"

             <br/>
             No I'm not. As the US Geological Survey page points out, there would need to be about 8000 additional Kilauea volcanoes to produce the amount of CO2 humans do per year.

               You haven't shown any math yet, just some separate numbers. Tell me about the mathematic formula of a theory which you base your assertions on.
              </blockquote>
              Ok so I'll do the math for you then:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              280 ppm = 10 m/absorption.
              <br/>
              The relation ship between CO2 levels and absorption is logarithmic so as you double co2, it reduces distance by 50%. Conversely if you cut CO2 in half you double the distance of absorption saturation. So cut co2 in half
              <br/>
              140ppm=20m
              <br/>
              70ppm=40m
              <br/>
              35ppm=80m
              <br/>
              17.5ppm=160m
              <br/>
              continue the trend until you reach 16km and that is the CO2ppm you need at the equator for IR to escape the tropopause without being absorbed.
             </blockquote>
             <br/>
             I repeat my question: what is the physical theory and exact formula that you use to make that assertion?
            </blockquote>
            Now you're being silly. Chemistry and physics determine the saturation levels and Earth observation presents the distance.

                You're also discounting the fact that CO2 doesn't absorb IR across all ranges, only across 3 small increments. So your article is not in-depth enough to prove anything as it doesn't find a cause for the lack of IR detected.
               </blockquote>
               <br/>
               That's not true. The article clearly states that the decrease of IR radiation has specifically been observed on the wavelengths which the anthropogenic greenhouse gases absorb it.
               <br/>
              </blockquote>
              Right, but it doesn't include past cloud cover, past landscape albedo, concentration increase, concentration increase of the supposed AGW components and the relationship to the IR.
             </blockquote>
             <br/>
             Are you saying that changes in ground use and cloud cover would produce similar changes in the wavelength of outgoing IR radiation as increased levels of CO2, methane and ozone?
            </blockquote>
            Absolutely. If the sun's rays aren't able to contact the Earth then the "black body" radiation output will vary greatly. IR will have huge difference between winter and summer in areas that receive heavy cloud or snow cover.

             That's not what they say at all. The peak IR absorption wavelengths of CO2 have been measured in laboratory.

            That's a poor definition.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            War is classically defined as a contest of force between 2 or more groups. Typically over resources or territory. Two groups of 5 would constitute two tribes. If they engage in skirmishes to control territory or mating rights that is a war, which all of the listed species engage in regularly.

            Or prefacing your statements that there have not been concentrations of CO2 at 512ppm or higher in recorded history, of course there haven't been "known" concentrations, we didn't start measuring it until the 60's. Which means we have 48 years of data, some of which is highly questionable. We don't know what is causing global warming, we don't know if it's man made, we don't know if this is part of the natural cycles we've seen documented in the past, and we certainly shouldn't be doing anything without a knowledge of whether we're helping or hurting the situation by interfering.

            I'm not basing my facts on "AGW rhetoric". I just happen to know some basic things of Earth science. As I already mentioned, the biological processes are unable to add or substract CO2 from the mantle and abiotic crust (nearly free of 14C). Are you denying that?

            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            Yes, but the CO2 balance of plants is negative, that is, they take up more CO2 than they release into the atmosphere.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            Of course, but rotting plant material is unable to change the relative amounts of the mentioned isotopes. You need CO2 which hasn't been a part of the biosphere for thousands of years to make the 12C/13C concentration rise relative to 14C as observed. That's because 14C, which is formed in the upper atmosphere, is an unstable isotope and decays over the course of thousands of years and is therefore not present in high amounts in the fossil fuel reserves and Earth's mantle.

            Lehmann and Feldman have gone out with preconceived ideas and manipulated the data to prove their preconception.
            <br/>
            Their results are bullshit.
            <br/>
            One of the oldest surviving cultures on earth is the Kalahari Bushmen.
            <br/>
            Theirs is a most non-aggressive culture.
            <br/>
            Then you look at the stone age New Guinea natives.  Some of these are still cannabalistic.
            <br/>
            Most of their "wars" are more ritual than real.
            <br/>
            They will put on a very noisy and showy performance and the most impressive wins the less impressive yields.
            <br/>
            Occasionally a few are killed.  If it was a real war as we "civilised" societies know war there would be hundreds of dead.
            <br/>
            Their wars are more like the confrontations between animals for superiority.  Rarely is an opponent seriously injured and even less often is an opponent killed.
            <br/>
            The animal or what we term the uncivilised way relies more on posturing and or a show of force or power and far less on actual killing.
            <br/>
            We do not appear to acquire the lust for killing until we become "civilised".
            <br/>
            Leaving thousands or even millions dead is a measure of our degree of civilisation, the more we kill the more advanced we are.
            <br/>
            These half-witted academics should stop making excuses for our barbarism.
            <br/>
            In what we term as primitive societies and animal groupings we find that adults protect the young, yet we have to protect our young from our own species.
            <br/>
            I think Lehmann and Feldman need to rethink their whole approach and to reassess their starting values.
            <br/>
            Of course there are, as there always will be the odd exception to this norm, i.e. Siamese Fighting Fish and of course Modern Civilised Man, i.e. Pol Pot, Adolph Hitler, Churchill, Mugabe, Stalin, Mao, and the list goes on.  Apart from the Siamese Fighting Fish all of these others seem to be us.

            I think this is just white people that follow this pattern because they evolved in colder climates. Whites see everything and everyone as enemies or things to be exploited. Other races generally are not wired this way. The aggression of whites is clearly demonstrated by the violent culture of the US, where whites still comprise 60% of the population. Whites have not evolved as much as other races because they have not existed as long as other races. Will race-mixing temper this aggression of whites enough over time to prevent nuclear holocaust? I doubt it. Why? Because the most aggressive people no longer have to kill themselves for their kin to survive. They have all the money in the world and can make sure their genes are passed directly on to their offspring. The masses of people over time mellow out but the elite get worse and worse for the reasons stated in this article. If we are to save humanity we must destroy the elite. Drastic times call for drastic measures. If we don't they will continue manipulating and poisoning us from afar while we argue over whether Democrats or Republicans are right, when they are both owned by the sick elite. The elite are doing things this very second to destroy your mind and your physical well-being. It's like the wind. You can't see it but you know it's there because you can feel it and you can see its effects.
