		&lt;h3&gt;General&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Welcome to FanNation, an interactive fantasy sports service where account holders (&quot;Owners&quot;) may participate in drafts (each a &quot;Draft&quot;) to form rosters (&quot;Rosters&quot;) of players (&quot;Players&quot;) from professional or collegiate baseball, basketball, football, hockey or other sports teams (each a &quot;Team&quot;) and compete in various fantasy sports contests (&quot;Contests&quot;) based on professional or collegiate games (&quot;Games&quot;). FanNation is operated and provided by TopLine Game Labs, LLC (&quot;TopLine,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Your use of our services, including participation in the Contests, is governed by these Rules, &lt;a href="https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/html/legal/SI/fanapp/gameterms.html" target="blank"&gt;TopLine's Terms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/html/legal/SI/fanapp/pp.html" target="blank"&gt;TopLine's Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			TopLine may, in its sole discretion, modify these Rules, including the types of Contests offered, from time to time with or without notice to you upon posting to the Site. It is your responsibility to review the Rules periodically. You agree that if you access or use FanNation after such notice or posting of changes in the Rules, you will be bound by all such changes and these Rules.
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			All defined terms used in these Rules and not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms.
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="eligibility"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Contests can either be entered for an entry fee to play for cash prizes (each a &quot;Pay Contest&quot;), or without an Entry Fee and without prizes (each a &quot;Free Contest&quot;). Certain eligibility requirements apply to participation in the contests, including:
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;AGE&lt;/u&gt;. Except as otherwise provided herein, Pay Contests and Free Contests are open only to Owners of Accounts who are at least eighteen (18) years old (or the of age of majority within your jurisdiction, whichever is older).
			&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;PLACE OF RESIDENCE&lt;/u&gt;:
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Free Contests are open to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States or the District of Columbia.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;PAY CONTESTS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO PARTICIPANTS IN CERTAIN STATES (PERMITTED STATES); PARTICIPATION IN PAY CONTESTS IS &lt;u&gt;NOT PERMITTED&lt;/u&gt; IN CERTAIN OTHER STATES (RESTRICTED STATES).&lt;/strong&gt;  FOR ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION, AND CURRENT LISTS OF PERMITTED STATES AND RESTRICTED STATES, PLEASE SEE THE &quot;ELIGIBILITY&quot; SECTION OF THE &lt;a href="https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/html/legal/SI/fanapp/gameterms.html" target="blank"&gt;TERMS&lt;/a&gt;.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="contests"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Contests&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				After creating an Account and obtaining an Owner ID (as described in the &quot;Account Registration&quot; section of the &lt;a href="https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/html/legal/SI/fanapp/gameterms.html" target="blank"&gt;Terms&lt;/a&gt;), you may participate in various fantasy sports Contests in which you compete against random opponents who are also Owners (an &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Open Contest&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;), or invite friends who, once they become Owners, may join a Contest in which only you and your friends can participate (an &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Invite Contest&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;).
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Contests may vary in duration from start to finish and may last one (1) day, one (1) week, or other durations, as determined by TopLine.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				All Contests may be posted as they become available for participation. Postings may vary depending on Game times and days.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Each Contest may contain certain restrictions, including restrictions on the number of Owners who may participate. Owners are accepted to Contests for which they are eligibile on a first-come, first-served basis.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				All Contests will consist of players' results from two (2) or more Games.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Contests are designed to close and Rosters are designed to lock at the scheduled start time of the Contest (which is the scheduled start time of the first Game involved in the Contest).
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				You can enter as many Contests as you want, so long as you have sufficient funds in your Account (your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;) for the Entry Fees, if any.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Contests that do not get filled with the required minimum number of Owners prior to the scheduled start time of the Contest may be cancelled by TopLine in its sole discretion. If TopLine cancels a Contest, it will credit Entry Fees back to the Wallets of the Owners that had already joined the Contest. Contests that are filled with the required minimum number of Owners prior to the scheduled start time of the Contest will be played.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				To create an Invite Contest, select the &quot;Challenge Friends&quot; option after creating a Contest, and select which friend(s) you would like to invite to join. An invitation will be sent to each friend (via the method you select) with a link to accept the invitation and join the Contest. Once an Invite Contest fills, no other invitations for that Contest can be accepted (it's first-come, first-served). Invitations must be accepted prior to the scheduled start time of the Contest in order to join.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="rosters"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Rosters&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				You may Draft a Roster and enter it into a Contest at any time prior to the scheduled start time of the Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				In Head-to-Head Challenge games, you may not revise your roster after you enter it into a Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				In Multiplayer games, you may revise your initial roster at any time prior to the scheduled start time of the Contest. Revisions after the scheduled start time of the Contest are not permitted.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				You may Draft a Roster by selecting among the list of Players available in the Player pool for each applicable Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				The list of Players available in the Player pool for any given Contest may vary on a daily basis, based on real-world sports news.

			&lt;li&gt;
				If you are accepting an invitation to a Head-to-Head Challenge game Invit Contest, you will not be able to select any of the same Players as the Contest creator.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				If you are Drafting a Roster in a Multiplayer game, it is possible that you may end up with overlapping Player(s) with other Owner(s) in the Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				The Roster you Draft must be complete in order to save it or to use it to enter a Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Your Roster shall include Players from at least two (2) Games.

	&lt;div class="player-projection"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Player Projection&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				You may Draft your Roster from the Player pool, where you can see the projected points shown for each Player (each, a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Player Projection&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;).
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Each Player Projection is based on the projected statistics for such Player, as predicted by our third-party data provider, and multiplied by the relevant scoring modifiers.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Once Contests open for a given time period, Player Projections will be locked in and will not change.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="roster-projection"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Roster Projection&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Once you Draft your Roster, the Roster is given a total projected points (your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Roster Projection&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;), which is calculated as the sum of the Player Projections for each Player on your Roster.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Changing your Players while Drafting may result in changes to your Roster Projection.
			&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="fantasy-line"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Fantasy Equalizer&trade;&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When a Contest begins, Owners' Roster points are adjusted, based on the difference between Roster Projections, and are creferred to as &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy Equalizer Points&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				The Owner whose Roster Projection is the highest will be awarded zero (0) Fantasy Equalizer Points.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				All other Owners' Roster Points will be awarded the difference between the highest Roster Projection and their Roster Projection.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				For example, in a 3-entry Contest, if Team A has a Roster Projection of 120, Team B has a Roster Projection of 110, and Team C has a Roster Projection of 70, then Team A will receive 0 Fantasy Equalizer Points, Team B will receive 10 Fantasy Equalizer Points, and Team C will receive 50 Fantasy Equalizer Points.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				For clarity, each Owner's Fantasy Equalizer Points may be visible before the Contest begins, although it should be noted that the adjustments may change if Owners change their Rosters, which is only possible in Multiplayer games.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="entry-fees"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Entry Fees&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When configuring a Contest to join, you may find that the various Contests have different Entry Fees.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				The Entry Fee, if any, is deducted by us from your Wallet once you join the Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				If your Contest is cancelled for any reason, your Entry Fee, if any, will be credited back to your Wallet in full.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="game-play-h2h"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Game Play - Head-to-Head Challenge Games&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Joining a Contest is designed to permit other Owners to review your Player selections and Roster Projection prior to the scheduled start time.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				You may not make changes to your Roster after you enter a Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				During the Games, Owners in a Contest can track Contest progress by using the live scoreboards that update Player and Roster point totals as well as the Owners' standings in the Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="game-play-multiplayer"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Game Play - Multiplayer Games&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Joining a Contest is designed to permit other Owners to review your Roster Projection prior to the scheduled start time, but not your Player selections.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				You may make changes to your Roster at any time prior to the scheduled start time of the Contest, after which your Roster will be locked.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Once the Contest starts, you will be able to see the Player selections of the other Owners in the Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				During the Games, Owners in a Contest can track Contest progress by using the live scoreboards that update Player and Roster point totals as well as the Owners' standings in the Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div class="suspended"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Suspended, Postponed, or Cancelled Games&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If a Game is suspended, statistics will count from that Game, up until the point it was suspended.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				If a Game is postponed beyond the contest time period or cancelled for any reason, no statistics will count from that Game, and all Owners involved will receive zero (0) points from the Players involved.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				If Game suspensions, postponements, or cancellations result in there being only one Game left in a Contest, then the Contest will be cancelled, and your Entry Fee, if any, will be credited back to your Wallet in full.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				It is the Owner's responsibility to be aware of potential Game suspensions, postponements, and cancellations.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="winning"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Winning&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				After the Contest ends, the final Player and Roster point totals are calculated (including any Fantasy Equalizer Points), and checked against official Game box scores. Owners are ranked by Roster point totals to determine final standings.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				After TopLine has received the official statistics for all applicable Games in the relevant Contest, the Contest shall be considered final. Thereafter, TopLine will award any applicable prizes.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				There are no tie-breakers for any Contests. Owners will split the Contest prize assigned to the specific place(s) evenly in the case of a tie. If the entire Contest is a tie, then the Contest will be ruled a complete tie, and all Entry Fees will be fully credited back to Owners' Wallets.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="score-revisions"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Scoring Revisions&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				In the event that the leagues or stat providers revise the box scores after the official Game box score has been released, TopLine will not update Player or Roster point totals, and prize settlements will not be revised.
			&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
				Note that this is not the same situation as a case where a correction needs to be made after prize settlements due to a problem with the data feed or the settlement process. In these cases, the settlement process (including payment) may be reversed and Contests resettled correctly.
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="prize-schedules"&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Prize Schedules&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Only Owners participating in Pay Contests are eligible to win prizes.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The Prize Schedule for each Contest shall be published during the applicable Contest. It is also indicated within each Contest, once you join a Contest.
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Except as otherwise noted, or as prohibited by applicable law, the Total Prizes shall be awarded to the Contest winner
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;

		Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
	&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		Our Sites, Apps and Services are meant for adults and are not designed to be used by or collect any personally identifiable information from children less than 18 years of age.

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;
		Third-Party Websites and Interest-Based Marketing
	&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		Links. There may be a number of places on the Site or the Apps where you may click on a link to access other websites that we do not control and that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personally identifiable information, from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites, their owners or operators

	&lt;p&gt;
		Internet-Based Marketing. We may work with third-party service providers to serve our advertisements to you when you visit the Site, the Apps or other third-party websites or mobile applications across the Internet. These advertisements may use tracking technologies to collect information about your visits to the Site, the Apps or these third-party websites or mobile applications. In either case, the purpose of the
		sharing is to provide advertisements about goods and/or services that may be of interest to you, analyzing and improving the effectiveness of ads and e-mails, and improving and enhancing the Site, the Apps and their content.
	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		For example, we have implemented the following Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising: Remarketing and Google Display Network Impression Reporting. We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Our third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (for example, the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (for example, the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site, and to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Site.

	&lt;h4&gt;
		CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
	&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;DMCA&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;) if you believe in good faith that any content on the Services infringes your copyright, you may send us a notice requesting that the content be removed. The notice must include: (a) your (or your agent's) physical or electronic signature; (b) identification of the copyrighted work on our Site, Apps or other Services that is claimed to have been infringed (or a representative list if multiple copyrighted works are included in one notification); (c) identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, including information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the content on the Site, Apps or other Service; (d) your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available); (e) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the content in the manner complained of is not authorized by you or your agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you or your agent is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, you may send us a counter-notice. You may read more information about the DMCA at &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.loc.gov/copyright&lt;/a&gt;.

	&lt;h4&gt;
		GOVERNING LAW
	&lt;h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		These Terms and all the terms herein will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. Any such controversy will be submitted exclusively to Federal or state courts in the State of New York. You consent to personal jurisdiction in any applicable court for purposes of any such litigation. Any right to trial by jury with respect to any claim or action is hereby waived by all parties to these Terms.
	&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;h4&gt;
		FORCE MAJEURE
	&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		TopLine is not and will not be liable for any losses caused directly or indirectly as a result of causes or events beyond the control of TopLine, including natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism actions or decrees of governmental bodies, exchange or market rulings, failure of the Internet, communication lines or utility systems, equipment and systems failures, unauthorized access, and theft (each, a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Force Majeure Event&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;). 
	&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;h4&gt;
		SEVERABILITY
	&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;h4&gt;
		NO WAIVER
	&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		Our failure to insist at any time upon strict compliance with any term of these Terms, or any delay or failure on our part to exercise any power or right given to us in these Terms, or a continued course of such conduct on our part will at no time operate as a waiver of such power or right, nor will any single or partial exercise preclude any other future exercise. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
