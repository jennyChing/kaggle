       We're about to enter the peak 
        of the hurricane season. Any day now, you're going to turn on the 
        TV and see a weather person pointing to some radar blob out in the 
        Atlantic Ocean and making two basic meteorological points:
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       (1) There is no need to panic.
       <br/>

     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Yes, hurricane season is an 
        exciting time to be in Florida. If you're new to the area, you're 
        probably wondering what you need to do to prepare for the possibility 
        that we'll get hit by "the big one."
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Based on our experiences, we 
        recommend that you follow this simple three-step hurricane preparedness 
        plan:
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       STEP 1. Buy enough food 
        and bottled water to last your family for at least three days
       <br/>
       STEP 2. Put these supplies into your car.
       <br/>
       STEP 3. Drive to Nebraska and remain there until Halloween. Unfortunately,
      </font>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       statistics 
        show that most people will not follow this sensible plan. Most people 
        will foolishly stay here in Florida. We'll start with one of the most 
        important hurricane preparedness items:
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE:
       <br/>
       If you own a home, you must have hurricane insurance. Fortunately, this
      </font>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       insurance is cheap and 
        easy to get, as long as your home meets two basic requirements:
       <br/>
       (1) It is reasonably well-built, and
       <br/>
       (2) It is located in Nebraska.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Unfortunately, if your home 
        is located in Florida, or any other area that might actually 
        be hit by a hurricane, most insurance companies would prefer not 
        to sell you hurricane insurance, because then they might be required 
        to pay YOU money, and that is certainly not why they got into the 
        insurance business in the first place. So you'll have to scrounge around 
        for aninsurance company, which will charge you an annual premium roughly 
        equal to the replacement value of your house. At any moment, this 
        company can drop you like used dental floss.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Since Hurricane George, I have 
        had an estimated 27 different home-insurance companies. This week, 
        I'm covered by the Bob and Big Stan Insurance Company, under a policy 
        which states that, in addition to my premium, Bob and Big Stan are 
        entitled, on demand, to my kidneys.

        SHUTTERS:
       </b>
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Your house should have hurricane 
        shutters on all the windows, all the doors, and -- if it's a major hurricane 
        -- all the toilets.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       There are several types of 
        shutters, with advantages and disadvantages:
       <br/>
       Plywood shutters: The advantage is that, because you make them yourself, 
        they're cheap.The disadvantage is that, because you make them yourself, 
        they will fall off.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Sheet-metal shutters: The advantage 
        is that these work well, once you get them all up. The disadvantage 
        is that once you get them all up, your hands will be useless, bleeding 
        stumps and it will be December.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Roll-down shutters: The advantages 
        are that they're very easy to use, and will definitely protect your 
        house. The disadvantage is that you will have to sell your house to pay 
        for them.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Hurricane-proof windows: These 
        are the newest wrinkle in hurricane protection:
       <br/>
       They look like ordinary windows, but they can withstand hurricane winds! 
        You can be sure of this, because the salesman says so. He lives in Nebraska.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Hurricane Proofing Your Property:
       <br/>
       As the hurricane approaches, check your yard for movable objects like 
        barbecue grills, planters, patio furniture, visiting relatives, 
        etc.. You should, as a precaution, throw these items into 
        your swimming pool (if you don't have a swimming pool, you 
        should have one built immediately). Otherwise, the hurricane winds 
        will turn these objects into deadly missiles.

        EVACUATION ROUTE:
       </b>
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       If you live in a low-lying 
        area, you should have an evacuation route planned out. (To 
        determine whether you live in a low-lying area, look at your driver's 
        license; if it says "Florida," you live in a low-lying area).
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       The purpose of having an evacuation 
        route is to avoid being trapped in your home when a major storm 
        hits. Instead, you will be trapped in a gigantic traffic jam several miles 
        from your home, along with two hundred thousand other evacuees. 
        So, as a bonus, you will not be lonely.

       </b>
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       If you don't evacuate, you 
        will need a mess of supplies. Do not buy them now!
       <br/>
       Florida tradition requires that you wait until the last possible minute, 
        then
      </font>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       go to the supermarket 
        and get into vicious fights with strangers over who gets the last 
        can of SPAM.
       <br/>
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       In addition to food and water, 
        you will need the following supplies:
       <br/>
       23 flashlights At least $167 worth of batteries that turn out, when the 
        power goes off, to be the wrong size for the flashlights.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Bleach. (No, I don't know what 
        the bleach is for. NOBODY knows what the bleach is for, but it's traditional, 
        so GET some!)
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       A 55-gallon drum of underarm 
        deodorant.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       A big knife that you can strap 
        to your leg. (This will be useless in a hurricane, but it looks cool.)
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       A large quantity of raw chicken, 
        to placate the alligators. (Ask anybody who went through Camille; 
        after the hurricane, there WILL be irate alligators.)
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       $35,000 in cash or diamonds 
        so that, after the hurricane passes, you can buy a generator 
        from a man with no discernible teeth.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
       Of course these are just basic 
        precautions. As the hurricane draws near, it is vitally important 
        that you keep abreast of the situation by turning on your television 
        and watching TV reporters in rain slickers stand right next to the ocean 
        and tell you over and over how vitally important it is for everybody to 
        stay away from the ocean.
