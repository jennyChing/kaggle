       Since launching the Musicbed Community, we have interviewed dozens and dozens of filmmakers and artists from all around the world. Weve flown to Paris. Weve Skyped to South Africa. Weve GChatted to Spain. And during all that time, wed like to think weve not only gotten better at interviewing people, but that weve learned a few practical lessons along the way. Weve written them down here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before we get into it, though, just a quick note about why were so into interviewing in the first place. It boils down to this: We think what other people have to say is oftentimes a lot more interesting than what we have to say. Given the choice between talking about what we know about filmmaking and hearing what Eliot Rausch knows about filmmakingwell, the better option seems pretty obvious. We interview because were curious, because talking to amazing people opens up our minds, surprises us, challenges us  and honestly, its usually a lot of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The types of interviews we lean toward (and so, the types of interviews the lessons below are relevant to) are usually a bit more rambly, the kind that take twists and turns, that unfold, that linger a little longer on a subject than people otherwise might. In other words  theyre conversations. And while there is certainly a time and place for a more straightforward Q&amp;A kind of interview, thats not the type of thing we get very excited about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres everything we know about interviewing.

        A story in its purest form is somebody saying this happened, and that led to this next thing, and that led to this next thingone thing following another.The Power of the anecdote is so great. No matter how boring the material is, if its in story form, theres suspense in it: It feels like somethings going to happen.

      <h3>
       Be Yourself
      </h3>
      <p>
       Its weird how this happens, but sometimes when you sit down for an interview, you can suddenly become someone else. You become Larry King or Ira Glass. You ask the types of questions you think
       <em>
        those guys
       </em>
       would ask, and you pretend to be interested in the things you think
       <em>
        those guys
       </em>
       would be interested in. And what happens then is pretty devastating: The interview gets really, really boring. Have confidence! Be yourself! Its only when you ask the questions youre actually interested in that youll get interesting answers. If you dont care where somebody grew up, dont ask. If you dont care what it felt like when the person won an Academy Award, dont bring it up. Be yourself and an interesting conversation will follow.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h3>
       Dont Overprepare
      </h3>
      <p>
       This goes along with being yourself. Before we interview someone, we dont overprepare. We dont learn every little fact about someones life and work. We learn
       <em>
        just enough
       </em>
       about the person to want to learn more. We learn
       <em>
        just enough
       </em>
       to ask intelligent questions, but not so much that we already know the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great way to kill the energy of an interview is to already know what you want to hear. Be open to surprises! Surprises are what conversations are all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, before we talked to character-building master David Corbett, wed only read the introduction to his book, just enough to guide the conversation and keep us asking questions.
       <a href="https://www.filmandmusic.com/articles/the-art-of-character-with-david-corbett/28">

      <h3>
       Make Your Subject Feel Smart
      </h3>
      <p>
       Great interviews happen when the people youre interviewing feel confident, when they feel like theyre saying intelligent things and youre genuinely interested in what they have to say. In some of our best interviews, we hardly ask any questions at all. Maybe four or five questions total over the course of an hour. A good interview/conversation should roll like a boulder, with you just course-correcting here or there to keep the thing on track. A bad conversation is like you trying to push a boulder up a hill. Zero momentum. A lot of times this lack of momentum comes from your subjects not feeling confident about what they have to say. They answer in a word or two. They, Dont know. Suddenly you find yourself doing most of the talking, trying to put words in your subjects mouths, and leaving with nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go out of your way to make your subjects feel smart. Ask them easy questions at first (we usually spend a good five minutes talking about where the subjects are from) and be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       interested in their answers. Affirm them. Just simple enthusiasm for their responses can go a long way to opening them up, making them feel comfortable  No way!
       <em>
        Youre
       </em>
       from Long Beach?! I
       <em>
        grew up
       </em>
       in Long Beach! or You know, I never thought of it like that. or You know what, thats a really good point. The better your subjects feel about themselves, the better your conversations will go.

      <h3>
       Dig Around for The Big Ideas (Go There)
      </h3>
      <p>
       An interview usually doesnt feel complete unless you go there. Readers or viewers can feel this too, even if theyre unaware of what exactly is missing. For us, going there means not ending an interview until weve dug around for The Big Idea. Usually this happens toward the very end of the interview, and its basically us just wondering right along with the subject: What does this all mean? What are the implications of what youve just said? Its this moment when the conversation zooms out a little bit and we talk about filmmaking as a whole, or (further out) creativity as a whole, or
       <em>
        (way far out)
       </em>
       humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We dig around for The Big Idea and we keep digging until we find it. Without this moment, an interview can feel like a random series of observations, scenes, recollections, ideas  which, while great, are usually unsatisfying without a moment of clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our conversation with
       <a href="https://www.filmandmusic.com/articles/a-conversation-with-eliot-rausch/27">
        Eliot Rausch
       </a>
       was a great example of this. The conversation moves from the particulars of Eliots story to ideas about intuition versus competency and finally to the true meaning of creative purity. A slow and steady zooming out. Same is true for our film on Adam Taylor. He begins by telling a very granular story and shows how it has defined his entire world.

      <h3>
       Let Silences Get Awkward
      </h3>
      <p>
       There is a natural human tendency to fill silences, to keep conversations moving forward, to do
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       necessary to keep things from getting
       <em>
        awkward
       </em>
       . When youre interviewing someone, silence can feel particularly devastating. Its tempting to immediately step in, ask another question, make a comment 
       <em>
        move things forward
       </em>
       . But this is the wrong thing to do. After someone has answered a question, let her answer hang for just a few seconds too long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the silence linger. What usually happens is the subject speaks up
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       .
       <em>
        She
       </em>
       fills the awkward silence, and she fills it by reaching a little bit deeper into her answer, saying something she might not have otherwise said. Be patient. Wait for those moments. Often the thing a subject fills the silence with is a unique and much more personal observation than her initial response.
      </p>

      <h3>
       Give Yourself Time
      </h3>
      <p>
       Finally, and very practically, make sure you schedule plenty of time for your interviews. If you want to get down to the good stuff, if you want to hunt around for The Big Ideas, if you want the conversation to twist and turn like a good story should, then youre going to need more than 20 minutes. Oftentimes the very best things we hear from people come at the very end of the conversation, right at the one-hour mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes time for people to get comfortable, for the conversation to find its form. You cant rush it. When we schedule interviews, we always block off at least 45 minutes, but we usually end up talking for well over an hour. Give yourself plenty of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example of this, check out our interview with
       <a href="http://community.musicbed.com/articles/conversation-true-mvmnt-four-four?q=true">
        TruMVMNT
       </a>
       . It wasnt until the very end of the interview that Wes told us hed survived cancer during college. It changed the whole conversation.

       So there you go. Thats pretty much everything we know about interviewing. Its not rocket science, but it is an art. If you have some wisdom of your own to share, please share it below. Wed love to hear what youve learned.
