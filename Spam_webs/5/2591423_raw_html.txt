             Humans are good at a lot of things, but putting time in perspective is not one of them. Its not our faultthe spans of time in human history, and even more so in natural history, are so vast compared to the span of our life and recent history that its almost impossible to get a handle on it. If the Earth formed at midnight and the present moment is the next midnight, 24 hours later, modern humans have been around since 11:59:59pm1 second. And if human history itself spans 24 hours from one midnight to the next, 14 minutes represents the time since Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
             To try to grasp some perspective, I mapped out the history of time as a series of growing timelineseach timeline contains all the previous timelines (colors will help you see which timelines are which). All timeline lengths are exactly accurate to the amount of time theyre expressing.
            </p>
            <p>
             A note on dates: When it comes to the far-back past, most of the dates we know are the subject of ongoing debate. For these timelines, its cumbersome to put a ~ sign before every ancient date or an asterisk explaining that the date is still being debated, so I just used the most widely accepted dates and left it at that.

               This. exactly. This is my ONLY nightmare. This is why I cant sleep at night. This is why trying is futile, why in the end, nothing matters anyway. The only consolation is being able to see at least a sliver of the universe, even though as soon as I die, that wont matter, and nobody and nothing will be changed by that fact.
               <br/>
               Now, back to distracting my mind by attempting to understand a foreign language and failing miserably.

                 Thats is not true, Bob. Every life matters. The impact you leave on this planet can be lasting beyond your own years. Take a look at scholars, artists and scientists. We still speak of them even though they are no longer living. They have made impacts on our lives today and will for many years to come. The notion that your life does not matter beyond your existence sounds quite selfish because it means you are only living for you right now. And if that is the case, then you are right. I implore you to do something bigger than yourself. Perhaps you will find more joy and value in life knowing that youdid something big in that short slice of time you were here.

                 The only people that feel that nothing matters are the ones who only care about what other people think or remember of them. Its important to try to better the world, to better humanity (we certainly need it), and if you get remembered for that, good. But if the only reason things matter is through the lens of whether or not youll be visible on a timeline, then you really should be rethinking things, because the reason *everything* matters is because everything you do affects at least one person  you. Very likely more. By affecting others, youre changing them. Everything you do matters.

                 I couldnt disagree with the first repliers notion of Bobs thoughts being selfish. Quite the opposite, I think this kind of feeling is the height of selflessness. In that same light, projecting that every life matters almost seems a bit selfish to me.. if not perhaps egotistical.

                 Think about what you just said, and the infograph. Everything we do matters because were changing people, and hes being pessimistic because he doesnt feel hell be remembered? Did you see the part of the infograph where THE UNIVERSE DIES? In the long run, your views on The Human Condition are just as arbitrary as his or mine, because eventually life is going to fizzle out. Our actions make no difference whatsoever in the grand scheme because therell be no more grand scheme to contemplate.

                 Bob, like you I have had insane days of contemplating this my self. Often followed by thoughts of suicide (sad but true). The fact is: That butterfly who changed the world thousands of years ago didnt know it, just like youre going to change the world and dont know it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Being completely transparent: I dont matter, you dont matter, no one here matters. Dont you see the paradigm shift there? Were all equal, which is the same as saying that everyone matters. So which is it bob? Is the the glass half full or is it half empty?

                 Bob, Given the enormity of space; the vast number of species on this planet; and the historical conditions and lack of conveniences in the past  the odds of a given spark of life occurring such that it experiences air conditioning; electricity; readily available food; entertainment; freedom to choose ones own profession and mate; and so on so astronomically slim  that it is as if we have won a galactic lottery.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are no Vikings raping and pillaging in most places. We dont have to chop wood so our families wont freeze during the winter. We dont have 13 children and only 5 or 6 them live to adulthood. Kings of old wore powdered wigs because they had fleas and lice to the extent that most of their hair fell out. We have Doppler radar (so we know when storms are coming). We understand germ theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 WHY ISNT WINNING THE LOTTERY ENOUGH?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why is it difficult to appreciate the amazing gift of life on this planet  for what it is? Why arent we all celebrating every moment just for the sheer improbability of being alive in this space and time?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why do we feel we need more to be significant?

                 Dude, dont agonize over the fact that you wont be Julius Caesar or Buddha. In fact, if given a choice, I would choose a small life because I DONT want the weight of the world on my shoulders. We should enjoy and appreciate the time we have here because it may be all there is! Turn off your computer, learn guitar, go out with girls, write stories, play softball, go fishing

                 I went to see a move at the theater last month. I bought my ticket, fully understanding that in 90 minutes, the movie would be over. I went to a party once. I knew the party wouldnt last forever. I still went. Whys stuff gotta last forever? Just enjoy the ride. Life wont give you a meaning. If you want meaning in your life you have to find one and bring it into your life.

                   I agree with those thoughts Chris, Do something , any thing  that takes some of your time and effort,. The one thing you will always have is memories, good or bad, and if you dont do anything you will regret just

                 Heres another thought. One life  my life, your life, anyones life  may be insignificant to the world, to the universe, etcetera. But it can be the most significant thing in the world to another person. We simply cant be significant to all, its too big a thing. But we can make a difference in someone elses life, and that difference is everything. Gandhi had it right: BE the change you wish to see in the world. You never know who will catch a dream from you.

                 Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope.

                 Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith.

                <p>
                 Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love.

                 We also know that we are part of the historical continuum, so we should leave the place at least as good as we found it, and ready for the next person.

                 I dont know why that would keep you up at night. The fact is that nothing matters. Absolutely nothing.

                <p>
                 We are specs of nothing on a tiny blue ball, as Sagan put it, in a shaft of light in a wayward arm of a distant galaxy of billions of galaxies in an infinite universe. Our whole of existence has occurred on this nothing of a spec of rock and nothing that ever has or will happen here is of any relevance to the vastness of the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even on that little spec, absolutely nothing has long-term meaning.

                 In a few decades, well be dead and the only ones who remember us will be those that were alive and lived with us. A few decades after that and nobody will be alive to knew us to remember us. The offspring of those who knew us (grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc) might think of us twice in their life time, referring to some tale their parents once said about these people who are long dead and never met them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In a century, almost no musicians, writers, actors, artists, or politicians alive today will be remembered. A few of them and a little bit of their work will be remembered and consumed and discussed by die hard enthusiasts and academics focused on those areas of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In a couple hundred years, only a single digit percentage of anything from today will be remembered or discussed and most will have fallen into oblivion. Not just not part of common knowledge or interest, but literally wiped from existence. Only the most massive historical events or persons will be remembered.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In a thousand years, maybe Shakespeare and Hitler will be remembered and commonly known. Beyond that, itll all become nothing. Nothing from today will mean anything more to anyone in a thousand years or so than any of us know or care about generally from the eighth or ninth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The worst villains who have evilly murdered millions will be lost to time and so will the greatest and most important and virtuous human beings. Normon Borlaug is known to have saved over a billion and counting with his agricultural advances and almost nobody knows him today. With time, nobody at all will and nothing he ever did will be of any consequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So think of everything you and I do. Or ever have done. Or ever will do. If the greatest events and people in all of existence mean nothing on this little planet, which means nothing in this vast universe, then what does anything we do? Any harm we do to others, crime we commit, life we save, good we do, love we express, years we add to our lives, books we read, great works we create, pain we inflict, pain we suffer, or massive fame we accumulate is absolutely and irrefutably irrelevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And this is powerful. What is the point of regretting for the rest of my life that stupid thing I did when I was a little kid or the bad relationship when I was a teen or the abortion we got when I was seventeen? What is the point of feeling grief that I wont be able to write the great novel or build a massive successful company or have sex with the most amazing woman ever? I can even go to the dentist and suffer awful dental pain and not give a damn, because it doesnt matter. It will hurt at the time, linger for a day or two, and be lost to the infinite time on either end of our current timeline.

                   I am pretty certain The Beatles would be a third candidate of the few names as influential as Shakespeare and Hitler. They were just as influential, if not more so in some ways, than both of them.

                 Bob, I think I feel close to how you do about this. Its overwhelming to think that I was taught from the beginning of my life that I matter, that everyone matters, that my actions in life matter  and they do to the extent that I will affect other people and things that I connect with while Im here  but as this infograph points out, in the end  human kind will cease to exist, Earth will cease to exist, our galaxy, and this entire universe will, eventually, cease to exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Its so scary and awe-inspiring that we are, for some reason, communicating and living now as humans, but one day it wont be so.

                 It doesnt matter what happens after we die. What we do matters because it is happening right now. Who cares if what you do doesnt affect the universe in the long run? You have been given the freedom to do what you love the most! You dont need to be the savior of humanity or the universe to feel like your life is fulfilling, and you certainly dont have to be any of that.

                 Anonymous from September 16, 2013 at 11:10 AM, I have to say that was an excellent read. Really helps to put things in perspective. If the future continues on in the same manner as it has in the past, then I agree completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What happens, however, if sometime in the near future (say a few hundred years or so), technology advances to the point where we can live forever? We may or may not get to keep the same physical bodies, but what if our consciousness can survive for millions of years?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Some imaginative guesses:
                 <br/>
                 Within 100 years:
                 <br/>
                 -Start taking monthly pills of nanobots that will rid your body of everything unhealthy and reverse aging effects.
                 <br/>
                 -Get all our energy needs from solar power.
                 <br/>
                 -Many products become dirt-cheap due to desktop-sized molecular assemblers (nanofactories).
                 <br/>
                 -Get a mind-upload process done and, if you want/need it, a transfer to a new physical body.
                 <br/>
                 -Artificial intelligence becomes smarter than man. After that, who knows. Technology advances much too quickly (at its own exponential pace) for humans to keep up. Hope youre an optimist for that part.
                 <br/>
                 -Everything is free due to robots doing all the physical work we used to do. Virtual worlds exist that interface directly to your brain (and after you dont need your physical brain your mind-file will do), keeping you entertained in whatever ways you want for as long as you want. Call it Heaven?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Within 500 years:
                 <br/>
                 -Terraform Mars to support life again. Wont have to rely solely on Earth to sustain humankind.
                 <br/>
                 -AI solves most other problems (moving us out of the solar system, etc)
                 <br/>
                 -A significant amount of matter from the solar system (and eventually the universe if the faster than the speed-of-light problem can be overcome) will be converted to computing medium (computronium) which supports the ever-advancing knowledge of the AI(s) and of course runs the virtual world(s) most of us spend the majority of our time living in.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For now:
                 <br/>
                 -Think its infeasible within that timeframe? Googling Ray Kurzweil will get you started.
                 <br/>
                 -Hope you live long enough for it to become reality. Im an optimist and thats all I need.

                 The term paradigm shift rattles my cage everytime I see / hear it.
                 <br/>
                 Paradigm is change (according to marketing); shift implies change. Isnt this kinda like rise up ??
                 <br/>
                 I, on the other hand, believe one of these marketing wizards added an i to the 2nd word of this term.

                 quite some time ago, the Dalai Lama was in the mountains somewhere in North America (I forget where) he was sitting in a diner and was asked by the waitress the one question that no-one had yet dared ask, yet the one question that all sentient beings must contemplate: What is the meaning of life? He replied almost immediately the meaning of life is happiness he made it sound as if it were a simple question, as if she had asked him what day of the week it was. find what makes you happy and follow that
                 <br/>
                 For all of us, there is something which will make us happy. You could interpret that as a hedonistic philosophy of the pursuit of pleasure for the sake of pleasure but I believe that long term happiness requires a relatively clear conscience. We all have a built in moral compass which is fundamental to how we act. The satisfaction from knowing that we have made the world a better place, that we have helped to make just one persons life that bit better is what makes life worth living. There are so many different ways to go about this I cant tell you what is the right path for you. No-one can but yourself. A good start, however, is to be mindful of others around you, to find what is wrong with the world and how you can help. This can be overwhelming but focus first on the small stuff: the quiet girl who just needs a friend to be there; the homeless guy on the street in need of something so simple as a cup of coffee. World peace can wait; no one can do that on their own but it may be that you can do your bit to help. By doing this, you will have made a difference, you will have mattered, your name may not be remembered for eternity, you may not be thanked directly by those whom you help but every one of us can make a difference, however small. Yes, everyone will still die. Yes, eventually all sentience will still be wiped out. Yes, people will still suffer but while those whom you affect are alive, their lives will be better and that matters. That affect may well last for the rest of human history.

               You got TVs for public consumption wrong. Many people dont consider the first TV home reception to have occurred until 1928 and even then it would be years after that tV became popular. You may have mistaken it with radio

                 To the OP, you are way off. The first television was introduced at the 1945 Worlds Expo. I dont know how you are getting 1928, and the chart says tv becomes popular in the late 1940s (which it does). The majority of US households have a television in the house by 1955.

               Love the timeline graphs! I also like an asteroid being described as dickish. Although I think calling them an ass might be more appropriate.

               It can be a powerful thing just to have a visual perspective rather than just knowing some numbers.

               I wrote an app can show you graphs of your tasks with a graph similar to the ones above. You can use it for whatever time you want to track by just dragging cards in a program called Trello. You can find my app at reportsfortrello.com.

               There is also another option. The universe will fall back onto itself and a new big bang will happen, just as the previous one could have happened as the end of a previous universe

                 Best current knowledge says that cant happen  the universe isnt dense enough. The WMAP measurements indicate that the universe is flat (about 0.4% margin of error), which implies that its also infinite in size. Those measurements and observations of the most distant objects we can see seem to indicate that the *rate* of expansion is increasing, which would mean theres something with negative pressure pushing everything (presumably dark matter). If thats correct, then expansion will continue forever (an undefined scientific term of art :).

                 Too many people think of OUR universe as being THE universe.  Thats not necessarily the case.  Its certainly possible that our universe is merely a one pixel-wide speck on the timeline of the universe, or of whatever everything, ever consists (or consisted, or will consist) of.  For that matter, its no certainty that time as we know it is in any way applicable to the universe in its totality.

                 Actually, according to our best knowledge, the universe is not flat, but slightly curved. Check out Universe may be curved, not flat by Ron Cowen in the journal Nature. The previous conclusion that the universe was flat had some errors, but the newer, more precise Planck probe found that in fact the cosmic microwave background is slightly curved, like a saddle, rather than flat. But even this finding they arent 100% sure about and so they need to do more research on it. Im not a physicist, so I dont really understand what a flat or curved universe may mean in the big picture, but it still is interesting.

                 True! However, at this moment all these atoms have come together and agreed to be me for awhile and allow the pleasures of family, friends, sunsets, etc.
                 <br/>
                 I have had the good fortune to observe the shadow of the moon sweeping across the earth in the 1979 solar eclipse and live with the awareness of that visual of the speed with which I am spinning.
                 <br/>
                 Perspective is a good thing.

               Wow, the perspective this provides is quite humbling.  At the same time I wholeheartedly appreciate the humor youve added, particularly the bit about the T-Rex and Justin Bieber.  Hehehe.

               Also, you probably already know that the heat death of the universe is only one possibility, and it really all depends on the shape of the universe.  Id like to believe the alternate theory that it will eventually hit an end point of expansion and just collapse in on itself, starting another Big Bang.  But my understanding of all that is less than rudimentary, relying on very simple explanations by very smart people

               Nice illustration, but you dont understand evolution when you write that our digestive system evolved before we started breeding wheat  because with this you imply that our evolution stopped at some point. This is not the case. Those humans who could digest all kinds of stuff better than others (whether wheat or dairy) were more likely to survive and procreate than those who didnt. Easy as that. Evolution doesnt stop.

                 I think he means;  evolved into the digestive system with which we are familiar today, in modern humans.
                 <br/>
                 We all know what he meant. Stop being picky.

                 Your stomach has a unique set of bacteria in it, thats created and molded by the things you eat. When you change your diet, that culture of bacteria that more or less exist to help you digest your food changes as well. Thats one of the reasons a vegan if they try to eat a greasy burger after many years often gets stomach pains or wants to throw up. I believe I have also read that mothers often pass this down to their kids.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So in a way, your stomach is in fact evolving

               Maybe the universe will continue to expand into nothingness until all heat and energy die off and it realizes that it is, in fact, a single point singularity and the blown mind that ensues will be the next big bang.

               Humans are not descended from apes but instead from a common ancestor shared with apes. And another thing: the Heat Death theory means that there will be no more free energy in the universe! This will be the effect of enthalpy in the extreme long run.

               what if we were to discover that there was more then one universemuch like we at some point discovered that there was more than one galaxy. And rather then a heat death, we absorb or get absorbed by another universemaybe there are lots of them out there. I was just wondering if Im the only one that thinks about that.

                 no, my first thought (besides the interpretive judgments regarding our demise, which seems to confine it all to the physical realm, but in actuality seems to be a lot more mysterious and complicated than can be explained in such simplistic terms with simple, 2-dimensional, or even 3-dimensional, graphs &amp; stuff)  although i can appreciate the humor  because there are still so many unanswered questions string theory dark matter even metaphysical perspectives that are used to try to help explain certain unknowns or unexplainables, etc all (or maybe not all?) rooted in the physical world, and many hinting at possibilities of other inter-connected realms/universes  besides, i dont believe energy can really be lost into a sea of nothingness, i think it is simply transformed, is exchanged somehow, gets transposed elsewhere whatever: to me it seems that anything that ends in vanishing is illusion (including your own sense of insignificance in the face of the macrocosm were all a part of this incredible creative energy source/s, and it is a part of us, too)  thanks to all, fun to read this &amp; participate

                 I dont see why it matters. Ill be dead in a few decades and since I wont exist, nobody that exists today will matter a damn to me. People that may or may not actually be alive in tens of billions or even trillions of years having to face the end of existence certainly dont even register on my give-a-damn-ometer.

                 As a physicist whose work (as of late) focuses on M-theory, I am fascinated by the potential scale of how much more there might be beyond our own universe. Realizing the vastness of the universe we inhabit is just the first step. Imagine the possibility of an infinite number of universes, each with its own peculiar characteristics. What if intelligent life is the unusual quirk of this one?

               Awesome!
               <br/>
               Could you please kindly add/change 2 things?
               <br/>
               1. Remove the fucked word. You poster is absolutely great and Id love to show it to children, but I obviously cant due to the above word
               <br/>
               2. Add the point were the World is believed to be created by God (like 6k years ago, right?)  Would be good to have it in perspective too.

                 Not everything has to be for children.  Besides, youd be better off teaching your children that theres no such thing as a bad word, just bad intention.  Really, grow up, and help your children evolve instead of being trapped by silly things like bad words.  If its that important to you, dont ask the artist to change his work.  You censor it yourself.

                 I think her point is to demonstrate the difference between the scientific age of the universe and when Christianity says God created the universe.  If anything, it just helps to demonstrate the stupidity of creationism.

                   If anything, acknowledging creationism in a scientific article provides a scientific gloss to creationism  which is precisely what the creationists want.

                   It never ceases to astonish me that anyone can believe the two Genesis accounts are literally true when they cant even be logically resolved to each other.

                   Moreover, the Genesis mythology is just some rehashed earlier Sumerian mythology, but the creationists would dismiss THOSE older creation stories as manifest bullshit.

                 I am glad God is not here. The issue with bringing God will be whose God? Allah, Jesus, Krishna, Shiva, Buddha whom you want? Every religion has its own timeline and that would have taken away the neutrality and objectivity here.

                <p>
                 In this timeline, at least people agree on most of the events having taken place  if you grad in God  you would open a Pandoras box.

                 Food for thought 
                 <br/>
                 Some omnipotent power had to be there during that whole spectrum of what was illustrated above (outside of time) and will always be there. Think about how all this could have come about from NOTHING and how we seem to be the luckiest living organism (with all this limited intelligence) that got everything perfectly and accurately aligned (ozone, oxygen, distance from sun, earth rotation, gravity, the complexity of an organisms biology etc to name a few) to be surviving on this spec of a place called earth. Now put THAT into perspective. You may then draw your own conclusions if something just appears out of nothing and the existence of an omnipotent being.

                 More food for the thought  the author points out that he doesnt understand the big bang, which is a sensibly humble position. The rest of us should try it sometime. To ask the question of whether something can come from nothing is rife with implicit, unfounded assumptions about the nature of time and space. And nothing is an extremely poorly defined word, that likely only represents a platonic concept in our brains, with little connection to the physical world. Positing the existence of a deity creates more problems than it solves  the who creates the creator infinite regress. The only scientifically reasonable answer is who knows; but I bet well figure out more as we observe more. Anything else is just hubris.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would also suggest that to imagine that everything had to align perfectly for intelligent life to come into being, is to misunderstand the very sense of scale that this article conveys. It seems much more plausible to me that life would evolve in almost any medium with a few basic characteristics conducive to the formation of matter, given sufficient time  and 15 or so billion years is a *long* time.

                 That came across a bit more harshly than I intended. More than anything, I just wanted to point out that the question is not as simple as implied, and that sometimes I dont have enough information to judge is the only reasonable answer.

                 Some estimates say the universe has around 50 sextillion (thats 5 with 22 zeros after it) Earth-like (possibly habitable) planets. This is obviously nothing short of a wild, but semi-educated guess. Those 50 sextillion possibly-habitable planets are but a fraction of all planets. Hell, they think theres around 100-200 billion planets in the Milky Way alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Is it so hard to believe that theres a 1/50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance that something went wrong on one planet, and over the course of the past 4,500,000,000 years, that something eventually grew into a bigger mess?

                <p>
                 In other words, Im putting the odds of a god coming out of nothing and creating the universe in 7 days and the odds of the conditions being juusssst perfect for life to start accidentally at around 49,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000:1 each.

                 And we get fucked anyway. How does that fit into your perfectly aligned so an omnipotent being must have set it up just for us scenario? We probably wont last until the fucked part anyway. And what was the omnipotent being doing for the first 9.2 billion years after the big bang but before the solar system formed? Hmm Ive drawn my conclusion. No omnipotent beings.

                 Keep in mind that the Big Bang produced mainly hydrogen (H), helium (He), and a little deuterium (D)  hardly any of the heavier elements like carbon (C), nitrogen(N), phosphorus (P), etc. that are essential for life as we know it. The heavier elements had to be cooked up inside stars that processed the primordial H, D, and He. But those stars live for billions of years, and dont release their products back into the universe until they die. So you know its going to take billions of years until you have enough stuff to make life, or for that matter, planets. Apparently it required several generations of stars, with younger stars forming from the debris of the older ones, to get the abundance of C, N, P, etc., that we need, and also the even heavier things like iron that make life more interesting. The long time allowed the rate of supernova explosions to dwindle away, too, which is a good thing, since supernovas tend to sterilize their environments out to a large distance. So 9 billion years actually seems to be just about right. So Mr. Omnipotent Being just had to be patient, I guess. Maybe theres a faster way to do things, but none come to mind right now.

                 Hey its the food for thought guy again  I see you all have some well thought out points. I dont doubt that some of your theories may have taken years of personal contemplation and deep thought (or did it?) Perhaps its something to consider based on a little more food for thought
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just to put it all in perspective, I will humbly explain 2 simple analogies for you all to take home based on your collective thoughts 
                </p>
                <p>
                 Infinite Regression  Lets assume that there is a sniper who has to take a shot (an action). He confirms to his superior that his target is locked and he is awaiting command (a decision). Suppose the snipers superior cannot make that decision and he needs to confirm with his superior and this goes on and on and on which would result in no decision. Will the sniper ever take action? Someone HAS to make a decision in order for the trigger to be pulled or in other words for the action to occur or it would result in an infinite regress. This is why you cannot use the but then who created the creator? argument because it would go on and on and on forever which results in an infinite regress and nothing would exist. Think about this carefully and apply it to everything that exists/ever existed and more importantly the first thing that existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What are the Odds?  Lets assume you decided to take a stroll in the vast Sahara desert. We all know how big the Sahara is (I hope ). While you walk the abundance of sand dunes, your foot strikes a familiar item. You look down and youre amused to find a Samsung S4 or iPhone 5s sticking out of the sand. (For fellow cynics in the audience lets also state that nobody walked this path ever before and accidentally dropped it. Even from a plane). Now would you at any moment think or come to the conclusion that sand and the elements in the Sahara could have caused glass and plastic to form/mold into silicon and complex circuits which resulted in this super smart phone (that makes calls and does wonderful things) even over lets just say 4.5 billion years without any outside force or intelligence? We all know it takes more than that to build one and thats just a smart phone. Now imagine our human biology and all other organisms or life forms that are far more complex than a smart phone. Again, think about this carefully and apply this thought process to earth, the colossal nature of its complexities to sustain life in all forms for all of its inhabitants.

                 You may draw your own conclusions on if an external force/omnipotent being (call it whatever you want) should exist or not based on the above examples. IF however you do come to the conclusion that you are a tiny part of creation, then ask the simple question, why would you not be given the answers by this external force that caused all this? Also remember that when you are ready, there is clear information out there to address the I dont have enough information to judge conundrum (if only one spent their time humbly and looked for it). The sheer scale of all existence that we experience, which some of you seem to confuse as why such a long wait? is yet another clue from this external force to display capability, grandeur and magnificence (if only you realized)

                 @Zach Waldman  according to the author the timeline is also aimed at parents and educators, so your line about some things not being for children is as irrelevant in this case as it is inane. Moreover, your precious admonition to a stranger to grow up by adhering to your unsolicited pearls of parenting wisdom is also an indicator that youd be better off following your own advice.

               I am actually acutely aware of the magnitude of time and to be honest I was surprised that the presence of mammals on Earth is significant in the picture that represents the Age of the Universe (13.8 billion years).

               The date for fire is much too late.  400,000 is a widely accepted date for the use of fire by H. Erectus, and there are a number of reports of evidence for earlier use, as much a 1 million years ago.

                 I read a number of reports saying that the hideous H. Erectus had fire as far as 400,000 years ago.  But also a number that said that theory as dubious and that widespread fire usage has no evidence before about 125,000 years ago. When in doubt I played it safe.

                 When is the word fuck going to graduate into the big-leagues, where all the real words get to play?  For a word that is so flexible, so expressive, it sure has to take a lot of abuse.  I say we all stop picking on fuck and just recognize it for the valuable contributions it has made to human communication.  And to those who continue to harass it, to try to hide it, and pretend it doesnt exist, I say: Jokeem if they cant take a fuck!

                 Christ isnt and was never a god. Christ was a person, born by the will of God. If you try to convert people, at least get it right.

               The whole graph is insignificant when compared to eternal life for all who will believe in Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God the Father of us all, and ask Him into your heart.  Hard to believe?  Just ask Him to show you if He is real.  Then comment.

                 Cheryl, I did precisely that and Ram said, all religions are same  different people interpret it differently and call it differntly. In the process they also found it convenient to call me by different name.

                 I beg to differ.  Odin is the Allfather; Christian mythology is just ridiculous.  If you doubt me, just ask Christ who nailed him to the cross  it was Thor using his mighty hammer, Mjlnir.

                 Its very sad &amp; disconcerting to discover that, although there is plenty of space on this graph to do so  just prior to the Roman empire &amp; after the Pyramids at Giza are mentioned  there is no mention whatsoever of the first greatest monotheistic religions birth  JUDAISM  the religion that is still here with us &amp; vibrant today; the religion that the other TWO religions mentioned were DIRECTLY born out of &amp; from. Is this yet another example of religious bigotry &amp; racism being displayed?  by the creator of this timeline?

               To be pedantic, not only is Obamas presidency out of scale, but the 21st century began not in 2000, but in 2001, so Bushs presidency should reach almost completely to the left.

               This actually mean we do matter and a lot  all those things, those million of little twists and turns in history that had to go wrong or right at just the right time, happened with us as a result. With the good and the bad that we know (though I would go for more bad than good as we lose our humanity as time goes by).
              </p>
              <p>
               Its a wonder, a miracle (if I would be a believer of any imaginary fatherfigure watching over us) that were here today  sharing thoughts across this planet that is at once so small and so large depending on which way you view it from.
              </p>
              <p>
               We should be taking care of the only thing that matters: us  instead of merrily massacring and destroying whatever we put our hands on. Each and every one of us has not only the chance to be here, alive and thinking, but also the chance to be able to grasp the chart above and understand what it means, even if the figures are so astronomical and beyond everyday use.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whether we screw it up or not lies entirely in our hands for once (asteroids, aliens and other cataclysms excluded of course) where in those billios of years before us we underwent the change we can now, in part, steer it ourselves. How amazing is that?
              </p>
              <p>
               Unfortunately, even more amazing, is that we use to no great purpose at all except for a few people who try to push that little gray mass of cells inside our skull to try and see beyond tomorrow, next year, the next decennia.

               Heat death can be explained.
              </p>
              <p>
               Every thermodynamic event (speaking physics), such as the friction that occurs when two surfaces rub one another (creating a force), the flowing of air (from one pressure level to another), heat exchange (such as a melting ice cube, or cooling the surrounding air) all causes some potential energy to be lost. For example, see this potential energy as the work you can do by popping or deflating a balloon: pressurized air inside can be used to make the balloon fly, or create a loud bang. When that event ends, the air that used to be in the balloon is mixed with the outside air and is now all of equal pressure. The energy that used to be in the balloon, has been used up. This energy cannot be regained, unless you re-inflate the balloon  but this will cost MORE energy than you will get out of it (due to friction and stuff).
              </p>
              <p>
               This potential energy can be more strictly defined as the amount of orderliness versus chaos at the molecular level. This is what physicists call enthropy. Everything that is orderly will naturally move towards a situation where chaos is maximised.
               <br/>
               If you have an empty space, and you put a large number of molecules inside it, they will spread out until they are evenly spread out in that space (equal pressure). This is maximised chaos: if it were your bedroom, your stuff would be chaotically spread out all over. Compare this to a situation in which all of the molecules would be placed in one tiny corner of the space, with vacuum in the rest of the space. This is a very orderly situation: all molecules are stacked up in one place, nothing around it. It would be a very neatly organised bedroom indeed. But those molecules will start moving, and they will quickly start spreading out  because theyre stacked in one place, while they tend to move towards maximised chaos (in this instance, equal pressure). Energy is produced through the spreading out across the room  similarly, it would take a lot of energy to force all molecules into the corner to start with.
               <br/>
               All these processes end up with a more chaotic nett final state. Some potential energy will have been used up.
              </p>
              <p>
               Heat death occurs when THE UNIVERSE as a whole has reached equilibrium, or maximised chaos. The entire universe will be a cloud of molecules, all evenly distributed, same temperature, same pressure. There will be no wind because there is no reason for the stuff to move anywhere else. Water on earth flows downwards because that expends its potential energy (which it got through gravity), producing a more chaotic state. But if theres just a mass of stuff of equal pressure, theres no potential energy in that stuff for anything to flow anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
               To summarize it in one big analogy: when you pour milk into a cup of coffee and stirr, it will start out looking quite neat and vivid with moving blobs, lines, swirls, etcetera. But it will slowly become more and more mixed, and eventually, all will be completely mixed into one optimally chaotic cup of coffee. It will cool down until its the same temperature as the air around it, and then the coffee wont even move around any more. There will never again form a white milky line in there, if left alone. Nothing will happen.
               <br/>
               Thats our universe when it reaches heat death. The black-white boundaries and swirls that you can see in the coffee, thats every event that occurs in the universe. When its mixed and temperature stops changing, thats heat death. Nothing else will ever happen in that universe, unless interfeared with from outside of it. No interaction is possible inside it, no life, no explosions, nothing. Just boring equilibrium forever.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thats heat death.

                 Thanks for this explanation.  And although it makes sense, isnt it still true to say that gravity, one of the weakest forces also has one of the greatest ranges?  If this is so and would were to consider the shape of the expanded heat death universe and a very very large sphere-ish shape* with scattered cold matter throughout it, wouldnt it still have an average centre of gravity (just like any structure or formation)?  And if so, over a very, very, very long time, wouldnt that tiny force coax matter towards it, ie back towards the average centre?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I guess the bit I dont understand about heat death frozen equilibrium state forever is how do you dispense with the notion of an average centre of gravity for all mass distributed across the entire universe?  Because if you dont, even the slightest gravitational misalignment is an unbalanced force.  An unbalanced force will lead to acceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                 *So about the shape of the universe. If it has originated from a single point then rather than a sphere logically it would be more akin to a hollow spherical shell with an outer and inner boundary between which all the matter is moving outward.  The thickness of this shell I suppose is somewhat defined by the length of time the big bang was emitting matter.  Anyway..

                 Thermodynamics is the study of statistics. There is a reason that molecules cramped in a corner tend to spread out: theyre moving, en masse, in so many directions we can only look at the big picture and say theyre moving at random. Statistically speaking, they will bump into each other more frequently on the higher pressure (inside, more densely populated) part of the molecule blob, and less or not at all on the vacuum that surrounds them. Thus a growing number of particles will statistically speaking be moving towards the vacuum, in effect spreading out. This will continue until the particles are statistically speaking evenly spread out, at which point they will still continuously collide, but there wont be statistical changes in pressure any more. Each particle collides randomly just as statistically often as the particles around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So when I say equilibrium, even in the context of heat death, that does not mean that nothing moves. Lots of stuff moves. Everything moves. All molecules will still be moving, bouncing around, bumping into each other. But on the larger scale, statistically speaking, they will bump into each other equally often on all sides. So there will be no macroscopic movement within the cloud of molecules (or atoms, or whatever).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now of course, all mass causes a gravitational force on all other mass in the universe. And if were speaking of one cloud of mass in thermodynamic equilibrium, then that cloud  considered as one whole  will have a center of gravity. Mass will be slowly pulled together into one cloud, the particles in it will bump and bounce around. Gravity will pull the outer particles towards the center, causing a slight (statistical) inwards pressure from the outside edge of the cloud. Inside the cloud itself, statistically speaking, there will be a few more collisions (because theres matter on all sides, as opposed to near the edge of the cloud). That pressure resists the outer particles from actually coming in. All in all, as many particles will get bounced into the center, as there are particles that are bounced out of it. Its a statistic equilibrium.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So youre right about forces causes accelleration, but the thing to understand is that heat death is a *thermodynamical* and *statistical* concept. You fundamentally cannot wholly understand or explain thermodynamical interactions by looking at individual particles, on which forces are excerted, which collide, and accelerate. The thing is that the cloud is very much moving constantly, but the movement is so equalized throughout the cloud that there are no more imbalances of any kind. No density imbalance, no pressure imbalance, no temperature imbalance Its all in equilibrium. So statistically speaking, save for the constant movement of all (tiny) individual particles, nothing happens any more. Life is not possible because it requires thermodynamic processes, and nothing occurs at that scale any more in the situation of heat death. Theres just tiny collisions of tiny particles in one big cloud that doesnt move, theres no weather in it, nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 About the big bang: not everything may have jetted out at the same speed, making your geometry claims not necessarily correct (but either position would be highly speculative), and 85% of the matter in our universe is either missing, invisible or unknown to us (dark matter). I try not to say or claim too much about the big bang or the structure of the universe, because I think we basically dont really know quite enough to be making such claims. Nice to think that everything came from nothing at a point when time wasnt even formed yet, but why that would have happened and why that something couldnt happen again are questions that arent answered.

                 Re: Gravity pulling everything back together: If there is anything left to pull back together that can be, than that isnt heat death yet. When they bump into each other and stop moving, thats heat death. If theres too much of that stuff, it goes into a black hole, which will eventually radiate away as hawking radiation  that radiation can never pull itself back together because under normal circumstances gravity can barely bend the path a bit.

                 Plus, theres not just gravity out there. Theres dark energy  a force that pushes the universe farther and father apart. An isolated photon will never ever find anything else to hit and is effectively time-dead. (Dark energy will create an event horizon that keeps gravity from ever reaching that time-dead particle.)

               Fantastic infograph! Unfortunately, the take away from this is a feeling of waste. Why? This graph clearly demonstrates that time is not a renewable resources  it depletes  a fact that reinforces the old wisdom that what we need to make the most of time. Yet the graphs shows that however great our achievements in space of time will vanish with time. So why worry in life? Perhaps we should just have to eat and sleep away and varnish with time someday! No waking to run to the office or working late to meet the target date for that report. yepeee!!!!!

               This graphic is bogus after is passed Written History at 3,500 BC. How in the world do they know what happened before then?  Sillies.  Read your Bible and you will see the true history is in Genesis.  Stop believing non-believing atheistic scientists.  Instead, believe the Written Word of God and the believing scientists who believe His Word.

                 eFUSION, need I point out the obvious flaw in your logic?  You believe Adam and Eve lived around 4,000 BC. Thus, by your argument and words, Genesis is sillies and unknowable.

               A thought  sure, earth-based life is limited to about another 800 million years or so  but just from this chart  the Universe itself could foster life for about another 100 trillion years or so (presuming 100 trillion years to when Star Formation ends, and that even then youd have new stars that just formed).
              </p>
              <p>
               So if were at about 20, 21 billion years from the Big Bang to the end of the earth  that cycle could repeat 50 times in a trillion years, or 5000 times in a hundred trillion years.
              </p>
              <p>
               Plenty of time for humanity to colonize other worlds and hop around from star to star.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, instead of ended it at the Well, were fucked point  you could show a range for life is possible in the Universe, which, granted, would show our current time is a very small slice.  But it would also show that there is a ton of time left yet for almost endless solar systems to be created, and for life to evolve.

               It took all that time to produce human beings who could know so much about all that had gone before, and then contemplate and reflect on it.  If that doesnt make you feel significant, then youre looking at it wrong.  The universe bent over backward creating you, your brilliance, your flaws, your silliness, your greatness, your odd smell, your orgasms, your pain, your addictions, and your love.  Its not THAT you are that mattersits WHO you are.

                 I want to agree with you, philosophically, that we are not the rubbish some people portray us as, that intelligence is remarkable and may be the whole point of Earth life, to get to this point, for Earth (maybe seen as a Gaia) to expand its genetic heritage outward. But, I am not so sure that life is as exceptional as you imply. What if life is a normal process in the universe? We only feel alone because its a big universe and weve only been technological for one centurya minuscule amount of time. What if there are millions of homeworlds like ours in this galaxy alone? Ill let Star Trek take it from there

               On 9/13, comments were fantastic, written by intelligent, engaged people with a firm grasp of their  our  place in time, whether gloomy because of the farthest future, or happy because of the wonders that exist here and now.  I loved the 9/13 comments.

                 Its funny how people bow in the awesomeness of a scientific chart that says we knew nothing before 3,500 years ago and then goes on to explain everything that happened before then in great detail.

                 I can imagine a universe with a God. I can imagine one without any deity. Can a Christian? If you cannot, then you are incapable of having an intelligent conversation with someone with a different opinion, and are therefore incapable of communication beyond your intellectual borders. Food for thought. Is it possible to write an argument in favor of your beliefs without quoting from your beliefs? Are you capable of imagining how others feel when you exclude them from your idea of heaven? What is that point of view called, sociologically? To illustrate, how would you feel about a political party that behaved that way. What do you call a party that has no room for any other opinion or view? Its called Fascism. Even if youre right, as you believe, you have no right to tell others that they are wrong. To do so is to hate Jesus Christ who commands you to love one another.

                 I am prepared to believe there is an animating principle to the universe we do not, and perhaps cannot, understand.  I am not prepared to believe that it listens to us or cares.

               Just my little palaeo nerd comment here, but the Australian animals thing is kind of wrong; Australia was still part of Gondwana for a long time, and thus connected to Africa, South America, India and Antarctica right through most of the Mesozoic; our animals didnt start getting weird until we broke off from Antarctica around 40 million years ago. There are fossil platypuses from South America from the Cretaceous, which is well after the 200 million year figure given.

               @eFUSION, you write, How in the world do they know what happened before then?
              </p>
              <p>
               Its called forensics.  Its how detectives figure out how the crime occurred and who is at fault.  You trust *them* to use scientific methods and seek the truth, right?  And you trust the result, right? Then trust the scientists, who use similar methods to arrive at their conclusions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lemme tell ya about Lord Rutherford, a physics professor.  Now, silver-iodide-brushed plates of glass were used for photos before film.  Rutherford had a stack of these, wrapped in black cloth, on his desk waiting to be used.  On top of the stack was a piece of pitchblende, a uranium ore.
               <br/>
               When hed taken a photo and developed the top plate, he saw an image of the bottom of the piece of pitchblende.  He soon realized that some kind of powerful light-like energy was coming out of the rock in order to produce its image on the plate, and that the energy was stronger than light.  So strong, in fact, that it shot through the lightproof black cloth that had wrapped the plates.
              </p>
              <p>
               He called the phenomenon radioactivity.  He then thought about it and realized that something must be causing the radioactivity: the breakdown of the uranium atoms in the rock, into lead and helium.  He realized that a certain percentage of the uranium must have been producing helium for all the years that the rock existed, probably at the same rate.
              </p>
              <p>
               So he cracked open the rock, in order to find out how great a percentage of the rock was helium, and deduced its age.
              </p>
              <p>
               A few days later, Rutherford walked up to a geology professor and asked him how old the earth is.  The geology prof hedged that, while they really couldnt say for sure, current thought (in the 1890s) was that it was between one and two million years of age.
               <br/>
               Rutherford dropped the pitchblende into the geologists hand and assured him, I *know* that this bit of pitchblende is seven hundred million years old.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now contrast Rutherfords research with some deep thoughts by Augustine, one of the greatest of the Christian philosophers, on a subject for which he had done absolutely no research:  the other side of the Earth.
               <br/>
               As to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets on us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours, there is no reason for believing it. Those who affirm it do not claim to possess any actual information; they merely conjecture that, since the earth is suspended within the concavity of the heavens, and there is as much room on the one side of it as on the other, therefore the part which is beneath cannot be void of human inhabitants. They fail to notice that, even should it be believed or demonstrated that the world is round or spherical in form, it does not follow that the part of the earth opposite to us is not completely covered with water, or that any conjectured dry land there should be inhabited by men. For Scripture, which confirms the truth of its historical statements by the accomplishment of its prophecies, teaches not falsehood; and it is too absurd to say that some men might have set sail from this side and, traversing the immense expanse of ocean, have propagated there a race of human beings descended from that one first man.

               There was a basic difference between Rutherford and Augustine.  Where Rutherford researched in the here and now, Augustine made assumptions based on an ancient book.

              <p>
               Next time someone quotes Saint Augustine to you, remember that he didnt think it was possible for Australians to exist!

                 Yeah Stan, Im not talking about Augustine.  You want to take faith in Mr. fallible-human Rutherford, but I will take faith in the revealed Word of the Almighty Creator God who was there at the beginning.  Science and His word do not contradict.  But us feeble humans do mess up interpreting the evidence quite often.

                 Wait what?  You mean we cant believe a chart that says we knew nothing beyond 5,500 years ago and then explains everything that happened beyond 5,500 years ago?

                 ZoroastrianismPre-catholic Romans, Greeks, ancient Egypt, Druids..and thats just off the top of my head. And all of them are equally as valid as your Christianity. The fact that you are a christian speaks more to where and when you were born than to the truth of a particular religion.

               Interesting comments on this post. Two thoughts:
              </p>
              <p>
               1) Thanks for pointing out little errors or things that werent clearwill do a fix of those things soon.
              </p>
              <p>
               2) As for the this makes me feel insignificant concept, I think what reflecting on all this does for me is A) makes me treasure my unlikely little moment of insignificance existence and feel grateful to be alive, and B) makes me not want to sweat the small stuff at ALL. It also makes petty human emotions like hate and greed and envy seem VERY silly.

               Im sure that many like me see in this fine presentation (Thanks!) how it took this long for Cosmos to evolve a sentient being capable of putting this chart together. As if we, as microcosms, are now given the opportunity to begin to understand the Vastness of That which brought us to this point.
               <br/>
               In these last moments of the 12:59:59 type models, how cool that our self-reflectivity can take another ratchet turn within by gazing upon the fabric of our own consciousness, with the Advent of the entheogenic Sacrament. The birth of Acid should be on the timeline!
               <br/>
               The Christian is right to feel a connection to an awesome divinity. The Science wonk is right to feel amazement and humble awe before the Great Thread of Time and Expression.
               <br/>
               The Skeptic gets left out of the best parts of Cosmos: feeling connected and unafraid to be reabsorbed back into the Ocean.
               <br/>
               Turn on, dive in, and find your true Self in the Great Mind that expresses Itself through you! Its only a step or two from ape to silly religionists or silly scientists. This rift can be healed. Theres much more for us to discover in Consciousness.
               <br/>
               Do Good, help others, resist crazy greedy mofos, and enjoy the fucking ride!

               Nothing happened before the big bang. The big bang created time and space, and nothing can happen before theres such a thing as time. Its like asking who was winning the race before the starting gun went off.

                 Every cause has an effect, every effect has a cause.  If the Big Bang was a cause, then its effect was the creation of the universebut logically, it also has to have been an effect.  It couldnt just have happened on its own, which therefore means that SOMETHING had to happen, or at the very least exist, before; otherwise how did the Big Bang come to occur?

               Sorry folks, but getting of the defeatist materialist, separated view of everything does NOT require religion over science.  Time is not what you think.

               Quantum physics (most proven and used theory ever) includes the observer.

               Brilliant. I loved the commentary throughout the graph as well. Made me laugh out loud! I loved reading everyones comments afterward as to how studying the graph made them feel. (i.e., significant vs. insignificant). I would like to add my two cents to this by offering a very simple analogy a grain of sand. Yes, we are but a grain of sand. But put millions and billions of grains of sand together and what do you have?  A beautiful beach. Likewise, the energy that one human being has unites with the energies of others in order to CREATE! To LOVE! To propel each other forward along this time continuum which will surely morph into some brave new world, I am certain.

                 They both exist, and can exist quite well together.  However, small minds on both sides will, probably out of insecurity, try to attack, or somehow undermine the other side.  But to believe that there are sides is fundamentally misunderstanding them both.

                 Yes, theyre equal and proof is irrelevant. We can get along. Or at least, thats how we have to act until 9/10 of the population becomes atheist. Then we can start being honest and insisting on therapy and medication for the nutters if they want to keep living in normal free society, like we do now with people who are schizophrenic. Id give it 200 years.

                 It doesnt take insecurity to attack the other side just a loss of patience. I, for one, am tired of religious dogma and the excuses for greed, killing, etc.,  Its not good enough  sorry folks  but it isnt  I wrote a lot more then deleted it as Im wasting what little time Ive got left on . other folks

               Its hard to believe that we were created by some higher being.  Its also hard to believe that we just evolved from monkeys.

                 My sentiments exactly.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Based on the commentary, why are people that believe in God or an omnipotent being foolish or stupid or believing in fantasy?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Doesnt the chart clearly state that 3,500 BC marks the beginning of us knowing anything  about history?
                </p>
                <p>
                 It then lists everything that happened in pretty good detail for the previous billions of years. Further it lists when man controlled fire, 125,000 years ago. ( Id like to see the proof of that  go ahead bring the evidence, Ill put my boots on.) Then of course when we started harvesting wheat (Again Ill put my boots on for that evidence.) But God is fantasy, religious people are ignorant, and all of this came from a nothing that suddenly exploded for no apparent reason into the entire universe. This is all because of our extremely accurate fossil record, which despite the over 25 million categorized fossils has yet to produce a single missing link besides a weird peach fuzz bird thing. I think with such quality evidence, we should make fun of God and religious people some more. Oh yeah, did I mention the part about the chart mentioning not knowing anything beyond 3500 years ago, and the whole belief that nothing exploding into everything? Sorry, but Ill stick with the belief in an omnipotent being.

                 Adam and Eve must be completely fabricated too, then, because they supposedly lived 4,000 BC. Obviously there are bigger problems here than just logic and reason.

                 You can take your boots off now. Now where is the evidence that your god exists? Why not the Buddhist, Greek, or Egyptian gods? Your belief in your god (and non-belief of all others) says more about the time and place where you were born, than whether any particular religion is valid.

               To all the people saying that the graphic says we know nothing about what went on before 3500 bc, thats not what it says.  It says that 3500 bc marks the beginning of us knowing what went on in history, and its clear that its implying HUMAN history.  Of course we know a lot about what went on in natural history before writing.  Geology is an entire field of science and the last 5,000 years is about .0001 percent of what that science covers.  Scientists KNOW that the Earth is billions of years old as much as they KNOW why it rains and how a volcano works and what the boiling point of water is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its perfectly fair to believe in an omnipotent being, but not at the expense of proven facts.  Wise religious scholars know that science and religion dont need to conflict.  And wise religious scholars typically accept evolution as fact.  That doesnt make them any less religiousit just means theyre being more sophisticated than believing that the Bible, which was written by men, holds the truth about god.  They believe in god as fully as anyone else, but they dont reject blatant scientific fact in doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a SPECTACULAR infographic and believers, agnostics, and atheists should all be discussing the fascinating walk through history the graphic takes us on.  Thats it.  If you want to discuss the graphic and everything within, this is a perfect forum to do so.  If you want to come to a blog that clearly believes in the science of evolution and spout out comments about how science is bullshit, all youre doing is provoking and taking the conversation off subject.  Its no better than an atheist finding a forum about the Bible and commenting about how hes sure its written by menthat would be obnoxious, and so is coming here to deny science.

                 Yeah my thoughts exactly. The existence of god is not the topic and no one should be attacking anyone else on either side about that on this particular forum.

                 Instead, can someone please better explain what a singularity is and how time can start at the Big Bang and why Im sorely misunderstanding physics when I continue to think, but what was happening..before.the Big Bang?

                 Time is change, right? If at the smallest divisible instant directly before planck time (basically a term meaning impossible for us to measure a smaller instant because of the laws of physics) there was no movement at all, just one big solid block of energy, then that was by definition the first moment. There was no time before that. In fact, if you were to pretend that there is time before it and could explore it from an omnipresent view, it would still be that same perfectly solid unchanging block of infinitely compressed energy no matter how far back you go.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No change, no time. The start of the universe. No before. Plus, almost no space at all for it to happen in.

                 We are confounded by time because we were made for eternity, without time. Time per se only exists here on earth, so all that time when nothing was happening is but a twinkle of an eye, a thousand years..350million years..doesnt matter, because its all eternal then and now and forever.

                 This is a very fine answer, although the way to understand what was happening before the Big Bang is even simpler than that. We define time by means of the changes and events that take place as time passes, right? A good (kind of simplistic, but good) way to grasp this concept is by imagining a completely void box or room, without a single atom of matter in it. Nothing ever takes place inside that box, so, if you come to think about it, the concept of time has no meaning in there, theres nothing to define time by. Now, the events that help us define time and its progression occur because of the laws of physics and their effects. The Big Bang theory proposes that the universe originated from a very small area of infinite energy, temperature and pressure. Our laws of physics, the cause of everything we consider an event, have no bearing there;we cannot possibly imagine how things inside this gravitational singularity would work. Therefore: no conceivable events before the Big Bang, as the laws of physics that help us define events are not in effect, so no time. The same applies for the question What is the universe expanding into, as our understanding of space follows the same principle. Its a rather charming explanation really, no need for math or specialised knowledge to grasp the answer

               I like this a lot and I would love to show something like it to my 6th grade science class but there is a certain amount of not-appropriate-for-middle-school language that would get me in trouble if I used it as-is.  Do you have a more kid-friendly version of this presentation?

                 Good English? Aint and nothing in the same sentence? Besides, good English doesnt use the word aint. If you are going to comment, you should at least correct your own grammar first.

                 anyone ss all one wordand you missed off the possesive apostrophe.  The word you were looking for is anyones.  Also, the syntax of your first sentence leaves a lot to be desired.  A better way to put it would have been:

               With all due respect (and I enjoyed every bit of this) please, before you make this available for teachersremove the word Fucked so they can share the article with their students.  Thanks!  It was great to read.

               Fortunately most people who read this wont really grasp the significance of it, or should i say the insignificance of life. were people to grasp this concept en masse it could spark anarchy as nothing would really matter. However, it is lucky that most people still believe there is a point to life and that it should be nurtured and protected for the short time it exists. We all deserve to have our slice of time on this planet, however short or insignificant it may be.

               Bro, back in my day we wouldnt let just anyone be a jockey. You had to come from a very wealthy background and your fathers father had to be the best jockey of his time for you to even be considered.

               This is a great thing, I hate to be a little selfish about two things though.
               <br/>
               1) You have Jesus and Mohammad, but you missed at least Abraham, and maybe at least the founding of Jerusalem, without Abraham, there would not have been a Jesus or Mohammad.
               <br/>
               2) Id love to have a Canadian version of this to use here in Canada.

                 1)I think that it would be better to leave off any religious time frames as those are not important to civilization. They are just negative human distractions that have lead to violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 2)Basketball was invented in Canada but it would be good to throw in some Hockey stuff too.

                 Agreed. I would remove all reference to any religious or quasi-religious event  because of the idiocy this arouses. As a Brit I smiled (!) at the Americanism of it but accepted that the creator is American (lol) and if I wanted anything different I should make one of my own  which, I note, answers a few such comments here.

                 And I feel fairly sure the Canadian person was alluding to the same of thing, hence the irony of 2).     Also I was almost moved to check such stuff as tv invention (which is NOT what is put on the graph) but what for  its not the point of the thing to nit-pick nationalism, religion its to do with Time Perspective  the clues in the title.

               The meaning of life part 1:
              </p>
              <p>
               1st of all, if Gold and Lead were formed in the middle of stars, and the Sun, its life is estimated to be about 10 billion (1010) years, and stars about 0.25 times the mass of the Sun to last for about one trillion (1012) years according to stellar evolution calculations, while the least-massive hydrogen-fusing stars (0.08 solar masses) will last for about 12 trillion years, Then the Universe is likely over a Trillion years old. Must be something missing in their equation.
              </p>
              <p>
               What if Creation?
               <br/>
               Pre-Big Bang: Imagine all the people, sorry. Imagine all of the energy in the universe inhabited by souls. They could imagine anything and everything, yet nothing was real and they already knew everything. As a collective, they came together for one moment and create all of the matter in the universe from energy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ever since the big bang, they have inhabited all live across the Universe and all energy. Imagine what it would feel like to be part of a star? To experience every life form in the Universe, plants and animals of every kind, to be able to learn and live without knowing everything (real life). Imagine that these soles have an infinite memory bank and record all life memories across space and throughout time. Imagine if souls/life forces, were not bound by time, on the outside looking in, and could be anywhere throughout the Universe at the same time (time travel outside of the body).
              </p>
              <p>
               Human Life: Everyone must find a reason for living before they can actively start living. A foundation for them to build their life around (religion, science, etc.). Imagine if a souls/energy took ownership of a body(s) and guided them through life, living, making mistakes, and learning. Imagine if souls had all of the knowledge in the Universe and that love is the greatest knowledge. Imagine if one lost control of a body and it did terrible things.
              </p>
              <p>
               After life: looking back on ones life with the ultimate knowledge of the universe. Are you proud of what you learned, of the difficulties you overcame, of the things you created, and the good you did? Are you ashamed or horrified by the things you did, did you hurt the ones you love? What are you going to do about it, in your next life?
              </p>
              <p>
               As energy/mass cannot be destroyed, one the process of the Universe has completed, it will likely start over again.

               Minor quibble: Television wasnt really commercialized until around 1947-48, although it may have been technically possible as you show it in the 1920s. Anyway, the commercialization of TV in the late 1940s was instrumental in shaping the modern era insofar as that matters!

               As a geologist, I am as well aware as I can be of the long passage of time from the Big Bang to the present.  I see signs of old age  things that have been around for a long time  on the beach (horseshoe crabs) and in the yard (dawn redwood).  Its good to be reminded of these things.

               This is a great piece. I was boon in 1961 and by my late 20s was realsing just how close to WWII I was born even though my perception was being part of the space age and colour TV, not Spitfires and Path newsreels!

               Could you do something similar for distances? Perhaps one of the biggest barriers to many people really understanding science (and clinging onto contradictory religious texts) is their inability to comprehend beyond human scale. Just like time distance is similarly difficult. What is the difference between the size of virus or bacteria cell and a molecule or a neutrino? How far away is Voyager compared with the centre of our galaxy and the centre of the universe? It would be great to see it treated similarly.

               A small correction to consider (apologies if this has already been pointed out, too many comments to read but searching didnt find it!): the lifespan so far of the worlds oldest living person should be slightly less than half (115 of 237) of the time since 1776.

               This timeline is riddled with errors due to its euro-centric, imperialistic conception of time and the universe as lineal and bound.  This is erroneous because time is cyclic and the universe is in fact composed of unbound multiverses.  This anomie is tied to the development of agriculture and rise of social stratification and patriarchy as well as the alienation of de-melanated humans from their hue-man ancestors.  It produces much fear and negativity because it reflects a cultural worldview rooted in a fixation with domination of the superior self over the inferior other.  Lineal time of the individual lifespan is imposed over the devalued cyclic time of nature and the collective. Nature is held to be inferior and humans are set not just outside the framework of nature but against nature itself, which must be dominated, and this arises in part due to the alienation of humans in the Northern Cradle from the Southern Cradle of humanity during the Ice Age, which begot trans-generational and inter-ethnic ritual violence linked to a shift in consciousness from spiritual knowing to materialistic fear of the unknown due to changes in levels of the hormones affecting consciousness and corporal hue, which are linked through the pineal gland.

                 The colonizers were alienated from their ancestral knowledge, so now they must violently strip away that knowledge from all the worlds indigenous peoples who know their cosmology.  Of course the colonizers would have it that the future be abysmal. What is the point of resisting their domination if all is doomed anyways?

               Just a few notes on what Ive been reading here.
              </p>
              <p>
               Add David Bohm to the list of physicists who have recognized something beyond the confines of current science.
              </p>
              <p>
               Memorize Ernest Shrodingers observation (in 1944):
               <br/>
               Consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember that science is a work in progress.  Science a thousand years from now (is we survive) is likely to be as unrecognizable to us as our current science would be to Aristotle (though I think Pythagoras could probably get his mind around it.)

               For everyone who is understandably depressed by the cold hard facts presented here (wonderful infographic by the way), here is a flash of hope and optimism:
              </p>
              <p>
               Our own facts and body of knowledge are based upon our own limited tools and methods of observation at our *present* disposal. What we can see of the universe based on these observations is not necessarily the true or even complete picture, by far! Rejoice in that!
              </p>
              <p>
               Other kinds of matter in the universe may yet come to be discovered, other patterns and energies and forces at play! What looks like a cold end and an inexplicable beginning are just the edges of our own present deductive ability, our scientific lens, and our data arsenal.
              </p>
              <p>
               In many ways, we are just sentient infants. And infants cry a lot. 
              </p>
              <p>
               And so, have hope and do not despair just yet, because we are not DONE learning and discovering. As we expand our ever-growing Big Picture, we just might discover that things are far less bleak than they seem now.

               Forgot to mention, small nit  the infografic has a couple of typos. The word envelope is a noun, and since you use it as verb (as in, engulf or envelop something), it should be envelop without the e.

               while we live, while we do, while our civilization endures, then everything matters.  When its all over, then it doesnt matter.  We are concerned about eternity because we are now alive and though we consider ends, we do not REALLY grasp ending.  As long as one is in life, life is all one knows, really.
               <br/>
               AND that is ok.  Live while you live. When you end, you may have a perspective that you cannot have now.  Its ok not to be eternal. When a play ends and you go home, you remember the action, you remember that you laughed or cried but on the whole you are ok that the play ended.
               <br/>
               This from someone who does deal with human mortality, with endings. In moments of foggishness I am scared and depressed, at other times, not so much. Be well and love.

               I loved your graphs and the blurbs are great.  I personally embrace the insignificance of humanity.  Religion and spirituality only serve to inflate the ego and teach you the concept of eternity which is not constructive at all.  If we all just accept the ephemerality of all things, it teaches you to appreciate your life even more.  Have fun, bring enjoyment to others, and dont be afraid to take risks.  Theres no reason to be afraid of anything because youre just a tiny flash in the pan and death is coming soon, so what the hell?

               This is fantastic and mind-blowing. I love the humor added to it. I wouldnt change a thingbut three other things are surprising in that they seem ancient but are really recent in the sense that I actually know living people whose lives they effected: It wasnt that long ago that Slaves were freed in the United States and the Civil Rights Movement happened in my lifetime. Women were given the right to vote in the United States only recently (in my Aunts lifetime). Not long ago blacks and females had been considered uneducable. I had a student who told me she had applied to MIT in her youth (in the 1920s), went to her first day there, and was told oh, youre a female, you cant be admitted here.  You listed the enlightenment and that implied the birth of  Science.  Science is fairly new (even in the first half of the 20th century Doctors were often just guessing at cures).

               i just cannot understand why at the depressing end its not as simple as: all matter gets sucked into one ginormeous big black hole, the universe around it is empty and still and non moving, (ergo, does it even exist?), but relativity sort of dictates that matter will never dissapear, as it exists ( following the logical that 1 cannot become zero and energy does not just dissapear, it is still in that tiny dot) , so will that one single point where all matter/energy has collided into not spark a new big bang? that maybe only on that one millinanosecond when all comes together  a critical mass is created to spark a bang?  because around it there is noting and in it everything which cannot be stable anymore? why the freaking feck not??? boggles me as it seems so logical.

               The last diagram is somewhat useless. You write that you dont really get what was going on before the Big Bang. The question is not useful, since there is no Time that is separated from Space. Hence the whole timeline thing is something that is not useful for anything before the Big Bang (or after the end of the universe).

               These sorts of graphs and charts illustrate exactly why I think global warming/climate change is such a scam.  I dont deny that its happening, but the notion that we humans can affect such a change after only 100 years is ludicrous.  The earth is cyclical.  It has warmed and cooled before even without us evil humans and itll happen again despite whatever nonsense we come up with.

               I am pretty sure that the very concept of putting time in perspective on graphs like these is eventually based on an incoherent human concept of time. Time might turn out to be something quite different.

               Not only is your chin and your computer and whatnot made up of stuff from that cloud from which our Sun and Earth and all that formed, its even better than that: the fact that we have complicated atoms here on Earth and in our solar system (that is, more complicated than the simple stuff like O and He) means that before our system formed, somewhere in this general area of our galaxy a supernova went BANG in our neighborhood and injected our cloud with those atoms, and possibly accelerated the star formation in that accretion disc that led to our Sun and planets. (We see similar processes in other star forming regions with very young suns, such as the Orion nebula.) It takes the force of a supernova to create such atoms. Thats right, another sun died so that you and I exist. And yeah, this means we are truly made of stardust.

               To everyone who thinks the eventual heat death of the universe is depressing, consider this: even with our limited modern knowledge of physics, we have already begun to understand spacetime as a single continuum, as opposed to 3 dimensions of space + 1 dimension of time. Time can even pass at different rates, depending on how fast one is moving. Perhaps an important philosophical implication of this understanding is that we ought not place so much emphasis on what the eventual fate of the universe will be. If time is no different than any of the other dimensions of space, then why should what happens at one arbitrary interval in time, such as the distant future, be any more or less important than what happens at another, such as the present day or even the first few picoseconds of the universes existence? Food for thought.

               There is no year 0 because the concept of zero didnt come into common use until around 900 a.d. in India.

               Indian mathematicians developed the numerical zero, and the number first appeared in Europe in the 13th century.

               keep looking into history as well as cosmology and eschatology. remember there are and have been many points of view. youve got a lot of facts that i wouldnt be so sure about, be careful that youre not grounding a life philosophy in potentially false conclusions (which are based on others still). for starters, 160 years is in no way ancient good luck!

               If for a moment we imagined that to say 1) we are totally insignificant or 2) we are totally significant are two statements which are simultaneously both true and false, we might see that the moment we are occupying is exactly the SAME moment that proceeds and follows it, and that experience as we know it, might actually be less of a biological manifestation of the individual and more of a guiding principle that is constantly re-creating the universe. There is a SPECTACULAR amount of connections, not just from the past collapsing into the result of YOU but in all directions, and they are interdependent! How miraculous?! If we were to really grasp the deepest sense of who we truly ARE, as individuals, we would see that we are in fact a function of the entire universe, which is constantly looking at itself through our eyes, probing, creating, traveling, loving, destroying, forgetting, distracting, transforming, always. Breathe in deeply, look around you, every ordinary thing is imbued with ecstatic beauty! You are awake in the middle of a brilliant dream where you can create ANYTHING! You become stronger when you recognize the deepest senses of yourself, THE OTHER! I see myself in you and vice versa and together we can make the beautiful place right here and right now! Dream your world alive! The key to immortality lies in otherness. There are no enemies! To say I am better than you so I will destroy you is like the stomach trying to kill the liver! We only succeed in destroying ourselves. So have a glass of wine with your neighbor, be good to one another! Its a beautiful life.

                 Craig, glad you enjoyed! I derive most of the inspiration here (and in general) from Alan Watts, Thich Nhat Hanh, Amit Goswami, and Joseph Campbell. Thich Nhat Hanh once said: We should live each day like two astronauts rescued from the moon. If you can imagine for a moment, you crashed on the moon, and you had mere hours to survive. Looking at earth, all you would want to do is walk outside and feel the breeze. Now imagine again, magically you were rescued. When you returned to earth, every single thing you see would be a pure miracle. An utter heart-breaking joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We must learn to live like astronauts who have been rescued from the moon, and are living in the miracle of life here on earth.

               There are two main paths scientists I have talked to about the very far flung future.  The first is everything dies (what you have presented) and the second is that everything collapses back to the pinpoint of light only to explode once again in a never ending cycle of birth-life-death.  We know so little that either is possible.

               as the old (well relatively) song says:
               <br/>
               The best things in life
               <br/>
               to you were just loaned

               So how can you lose
               <br/>
               What you never owned?
               <br/>
               Life is just a bowl of cherries.

               During the AD era (actually since around 500 BC) humans knew the world was round, the error was placing that round earth at the centre of the universe. Id rewrite thinking the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around it as simply thinking the sun revolved around the earth
              </p>
              <p>
               We know a little bit about history prior to the development of writing in 3500 BC, since we have evidence from archaeology  statues, agricultural tools, remains of buildings etc. Thats how we know that wheat cultivation started around 9000 BC. Id rewrite the beginning of us knowing anything about what went on in history as the beginning of us knowing much about what went on in history

               I think there are a lot of people commenting on this about errors, debating theology, geology, zoology, biology, and so many other things forgetting that this was made by a person. No one is perfect, I think everyone can agree. In my opinion, everyone should use this as just a general reference, or a helpful tool, or maybe even just something to get your mind thinking about more than just yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
               Perhaps there are factual errors. So what.
              </p>
              <p>
               For me, Im thankful to have seen these bc of the thought processes that come from it. There IS much more than just a single human life, but then again, a single human life can affect so many others, who affect others, and so on and so on. (butterfly effect)
              </p>
              <p>
               All in all, obviously there was considerable effort in making these timelines. Its sad to see there are so many only criticizing and complaining about them. For me, I just say thank you for making them.

               Bobs original post is the right one for this thread, I think.  As Lucy once said in a Peanuts strip, Now that I know that, what do I do?  What stuns me about contemplating this perspective is how we ended up being a species that cares about meaning  one way or the other.  I believe evolutionary theory, but I cant comprehend how its evolutionarily necessary for us to be that way.  You look at this timeline and also consider that were the first on this timeline to SEE this timeline, so far as were able to understand.  The question of meaning and purpose and whether and how we matter is the whole enchilada.  Religious or spiritual narrowism may be wholly insufficient, but I cant rule out the spiritual impulse as a reasonable reaction to seeing and trying to comprehend all this.

               Its cool (but depressing ? ) to see that life on earth is just the same as the life of the universe : you dont know what happened before your birth, you evolve nicely to some point, and years after years, you get older, decaying, and finally theres no more energy in your body to let you be alive.

               All of you have it wrong. Our universe has the higher probability of being a computer simulation.
              </p>
              <p>
               But guess what? It still doesnt matter. Im still conscious and am able to grapple with the idea of my own existence and that is significant. What I do affects other conscious beings and that is greatly significant. We are all made of the same stuff and connected at a quantum level (simulation or not) and that is of the utmost significance.

               If you want to read something really mind-boggling on the subject of the big bang and the future of the universe, I recommend Roger Penroses Cycles of Time. I dont fully understand it but he argues that when you take the future of the universe to infinity it resembles the start of the big bang and that, therefore, you can have one universe (or epoch) after another and theyre all infinite. Its so well-written that youll think youre understanding it for a brief moment and that brief moment is a lot of fun.

               (2) things needed to happen exactly as they happened.  (I assume youre talking about the existence of language-using beings with consciousness, rather than the trivial transfer and modification of DNA down through the ages.)  No.  We know that things happened this way on this planet.  Its a chaotic process, and we cannot know which changes would have had large effects, and which wouldnt.  Similar results likely have happened on other planets that well never know about due to our inability to go there, or communicate with them, in any useful way.

               (3) the facts of reality are just too intense.  No.  Nothing beyond the next 120 years really matters to anyone seeing this message.  Unless theres some medical (and economic) breakthrough, well all be dead and gone.

               In your Animals graph, you speculated that had the asteroid not hit, it would be dinosaurs taking their kids to violin lessons. Years ago, I read a scientific paper which said that very same thing. So perhaps the writers of V had it right

               So the time before the Big Bang was confusing and resembled a gay pride flag?
              </p>
              <p>
               That doesnt really matter.  What does is what happened before the Big Bang, and what will happen sometime in the era of the Big Chill, trillions of years in the future.
              </p>

               String theory lends itself to membrane theory and multiple, parallel universes, none interacting with the other, but all somehow able to share the same space-time, but in different dimensions with different laws of physics.  Other theories state that these multiple universes occupy a bubble very, very far apart, so they can expand and we can never reach across the void to another universe.  But it is possible for two universes to touch, causing strange events, including matter exchange.  The membrane theory takes the parallel universes and flattens out their space-time for illustration purposes.  Each universe does its own thing, and the membranes maintain relative separation.  Even if a universe completely dies, the matter and energy are there somewhere.  A theory states that sometimes two membranes get too close, causing a dead universe to regenerate matter in a new big bang of sorts.

               The trick is living that far as a species, or as evolved.  There is no way to ever travel the vast distances, or is there?  In the traditional sense, in order to travel it, you need to go faster than light.  Mass expands too much and energy requirements are massive, plus time dilation happens, so even if you traveled close to light speed, a 20-year round trip to many stars would take hundreds or thousands of years on Earth and poses an interesting paradox.  Faster than light would seem to allow you to go back in time, and an apparent violation.  But warp bubbles solves all those problems.  Your ship doesnt really travel in space-time, but your area of space moves with you, and can do it incredibly fast.  Since you dont move in space-time, you can travel the same 20 years in 20 years with no time dilation.  Problems solved.  And newer theories state that you can even make the trip FASTER than light, so we could explore the entire galaxy in a matter of decades, given enough ships.  We could make the trip to other galaxies in a lifetime if we wanted.
              </p>
              <p>
               And if technology expands our lifespans as some promise, we could be the first generation not to die of natural causes, so we could make these incredible trips ourselves.

               One thing that seems never to be mentioned when people talk about finding intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, is the incredibly brief time that weve had it on earth compared to both the life span of planets and the time (for particles at least) to travel across it. We may find evidence that some form of life existed on Mars  only we missed it by huge multiples of our own existence.

               To address the unknown and confusing parts of time, life and death there is a book that offers a new and different explanation of the truth that makes sense, search for Truth Contest in Google and click the 1st result, then click on The Present and read what it says. This is truth you can check.

               This is all well and good, very forward thinking, looking out 10^10^^120 years or so.  However, it begs the question, What happens after that?  More importantly, when are they going to make a movie about it?

               The internet was a Big Bang.
               <br/>
               And look at how much we create out of nothing every day.  Something is in our brain and then somehow we make it physical and real.
               <br/>
               This stuff is so much bigger than we will ever understand.  When I look at the acceleration of technology and knowledge that graph, I think, it will only be a relatively short amount of time before we leave this planet.  Then I think, how can anyone see these charts and think that we are the only intelligent life form to ever exist???
               <br/>
               We may not matter in the long run.  Or we might in the sense of good v. evil; light v. darkness;  But what does matter for sure is how you feel.  Because happiness, sadness, and pain are very real.  Control your own life and make it a happy one.

               Sweet, sweet stuff. Cant say Im thankful for the reminder though. Thoughts on matters such as this always bring on more or less intense episodes of panic.

               This is pretty cool, and Im going to confess I didnt read every comment nor did I notice every detail, but why use the phrase the time since Christ as a historical milestone? No matter how scientific, inspiring, or profound something may be, using a religious period to describe a point in time is absurd when youre sending out a message to the entire world.

                 Christ is just used as a generic name for Jesus, who did exist. Whether he was divine or the son of God is a religous topic and another story, but the physical human lifeform definately did exist.

               I consider myself aptly humbled by gazing at the night sky and understanding that I am seeing much more than pretty twinkling motes of light in a dark sky, and that in the reverse direction, I am not even conceived of.  When I hiked the Appalachian trail, I was well aware that my utter amazement at what I saw from each hard earned mountaintop will have gone totally unnoticed or cared about by anyone or anything other than myself.  But that hardly mattered.  And I know that from my socio-economic perspective, there is nothing good I could accomplish that would ever (short of maybe having a EUREKA moment and perhaps, say, coming up with the formula for faster-than-light propulsion) match the utter evil perpetrated (and thus remembered) by the likes of Hitler or Khan, which, yet again, hardly matters.  I am who I am.  I will have come, I will have gone, and beyond the next generation (if Im lucky), no one will remember I was ever here.  And when the universe collapses upon itself and explodes forth once again, my having been here or not will not have mattered one bit.  I can handle that.  No one needs to try and convince me otherwise, but if it makes YOUR existence mean something more for having tried, then knock yourselves out.  Whatever makes you happy

               Thanks for the tour.  I remember Carl Sagan standing on a calendar of a year, marking time since the Big Bang, and showing our own history takes up something like ten seconds of the last day of the year.  But hey, thats when everyone gets to kiss, right?
              </p>
              <p>
               But really, I was surprised at how long one could see the 90 year-olds life.  That recorded time would be covered by 55 people living to be a 100.  Makes me feel young or something.

               As for Confusing/Depressing, I remember a professor giving a quote that went something like, Life is a brief vale of tears set between two eternities of oblivion.

               But in some way it does matter.  Pick up a scared puppy and care for it and it doesnt matter that theres no Puppy Space Explorer Empire or any other vanity of man.  Theres just compassion and getting through this together.

              <p>
               Thanks for this incredible graphic presentation. I think that a number of my friends, whom are biology teachers, would like to use it (in France).
               <br/>
               So Id like to know if there is a way that I can have the source files to translate them myself, or even if I can help you with the translation in French.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks again and have a nice day. Or year. Or billion years.

               Food for thought 
               <br/>
               Some omnipotent power had to be there during that whole spectrum of what was illustrated above (outside of time) and will always be there. Think about how all things could have come about from NOTHING and how we seem to be the luckiest living organism (with all this limited intelligence) that got everything perfectly and accurately aligned (ozone, oxygen, distance from sun, earth rotation, gravity, the complexity of an organisms biology etc to name a few) to be surviving on this spec of a place called earth. Now put that into perspective. You may then draw your own conclusions if something just appears out of nothing and the existence or non existence of an omnipotent being.

                 Hey its the food for thought guy again  For all you cynics out there I will humbly explain 2 simple analogies for you all to take home based on following key points 
                </p>
                <p>
                 Infinite Regression  Lets assume that there is a sniper who has to take a shot (an action). He confirms to his superior that his target is locked and he is awaiting command (a decision). Suppose the snipers superior cannot make that decision and he needs to confirm with his superior and this goes on and on and on which would result in no decision. Will the sniper ever take action? Someone HAS to make a decision in order for the trigger to be pulled or in other words for the action to occur or it would result in an infinite regress. This is why you cannot use the but then who created the creator? argument because it would go on and on and on forever which results in an infinite regress and nothing would exist. Think about this carefully and apply it to everything that exists/ever existed and more importantly the first thing that existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What are the Odds?  Lets assume you decided to take a stroll in the vast Sahara desert. We all know how big the Sahara is (I hope ). While you walk the abundance of sand dunes, your foot strikes a familiar item. You look down and youre amused to find a Samsung S4 or iPhone 5s sticking out of the sand. (For fellow cynics in the audience lets also state that nobody walked this path ever before and accidentally dropped it. Even from a plane). Now would you at any moment think or come to the conclusion that sand and the elements in the Sahara could have caused glass and plastic to form/mold into silicon and complex circuits which resulted in this super smart phone (that makes calls and does wonderful things) even over lets just say 4.5 billion years without any outside force or intelligence? We all know it takes more than that to build one and thats just a smart phone. Now imagine our human biology and all other organisms or life forms that are far more complex than a smart phone. Again, think about this carefully and apply this thought process to earth, the colossal nature of its complexities to sustain life in all forms for all of its inhabitants.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You may draw your own conclusions on if an external force/omnipotent being (call it whatever you want) should exist or not based on the above examples. IF however you do come to the conclusion that you are a tiny part of creation, then ask the simple question, why would you not be given the evidence/answers by this external force that caused all this? Also remember that when you are ready, there is clear evidence/information out there to address the I dont have enough information to judge conundrum (if only one spent their time humbly and looked for it). The sheer scale of all existence that we experience, which some of you seem to confuse as why such a long wait? is yet another clue from this external force to display capability, grandeur and magnificence (if only you realized)

               As a teacher, for the nearer history, I find this helpful. I get a bit frustrated with the over-emphasis on American History in this country. Helps to show how short a time Europe-colonized America has been around. We Americans make so many mistakes in diplomacy because we dont understand world history and global culture. However, I tend to agree with another poster about our inability to understand time on the wider scale. Because we human creatures are limited to time, and to our particular time, it is incredibly difficult for us to understand time. Im not sure that we can say that we know that time marches along in a particular way, with particular results if we were not there to see them. How do we know everything is so linear? What if processes at some times speed up beyond what we currently know, or slow down? I think its always important to recognize that as much as we think we know, there is so much we dont know. We look back at earlier times and laugh at how primitive people were as though we are so enlightened and all-knowing now? How much do we not know?

               I enjoyed this a lot except of course the Paleo plug for wheat entering the diet 9,000 years ago. Why put such a blatantly false and poorly researched piece of propagandized nonsense into the middle of an otherwise really neat piece of work? Cereal grains have sustained healthy human populations all over the world for over 100,000 years. Wheat, rice, (bread), potatoes, corn, squash, beans  none of these cause diseases of affluence, now called Non-communicable diseases. Some basic food for thought:

               I think this is really beautiful. And I also think that our universe is one of many, perhaps infinite numbers of universes. String Theory is a popular theory of everything  that involves the existence of extra dimensions, some curled up inside the five we can experience. If so, our universe is inextricably tied to other ones, even though we cannot see or understand them. To me, this is so extraordinary and meaningful. I am Buddhist, and believe existence is eternal, and although our short lives may not seem to have any impact on anything big or important that we can see, we are connected to all things in the same small ways that led the apes to become creatures who created music and art and tacos and have the ability to love and sacrifice. The universe is full of SOUL, that is its purpose and its meaning, to be soulful and beautiful just as it is and to be enjoyed.

               Wonderful depiction in chronological order of the universe in retrospect of time.
               <br/>
               In our lives, we normally are least bothered about what happened in past and only struggle for better present and future.
               <br/>
               This presentation clearly shows that human life is really a very smal fraction of universe life.
               <br/>
               It is really too small to discover universe facts and mysteries. Thats why we require to cascade research and learnings generations over generations, no matter related to science or society to elevate human race.
               <br/>
               Fortunately, we have words of divine to structure lives and civilzation as an alien aid to accelerate facts findings and uncovering mysteries.
               <br/>
               What has been done by modern man history has to be dupplemented by contemporary scholars and scientists to have better tomorrow as an outcome of this learning curve.

               I dont really get why people despair when they read things like this. Yeah, ultimately everything is going to die and the universe will collapse, but we knew that already. We all die one way or another. And yeah were insignificant in the scale of things, and given the size of the universe, it would be incredibly shocking if other, better, less stupid civilisations didnt exist and make us look bad.
              </p>
              <p>
               But weve got a life on this planet. If nothing ultimately matters, thats not a reason to get depressed. It just takes the pressure off. Who cares if you earn loads of money? Who cares about status symbols and accepted beauty and social pressure? Thats the stuff that doesnt matter.
              </p>
              <p>
               What this should make you realise is that none of it matters, so have fun with the time youve got. Go do whatever you feel like, so long as youre nice to other people. Because thats the only important thing we really have is other people. Our lifespan is too short to do much to the universe, so we may as well do as much as we can here. Forget all the pressure, dont get depressed about how tiny we are; go and make the world a better place.

              <p>
               The opportunity to live as a sentient being is shared by such an infinitesimally small portion of the matter in this universe, that to spend even a second of it in any state except pure joy, is not only a crime against humanity, it is a crime against all existence.

               Do we die? This seems final.
               <br/>
               Or, can we / do we return to the state we were in BEFORE we were born? Certainly, there was an entire Universe to be born into  nobody seems to have any trouble with such a state. This individuality thing has gotten slightly out-of-hand.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are all cast from the same mold. DNA studies confirm this. Man is slowly changing; so much remains constant ( did the cave man squint at the morning sunrise? You better believe it!).

               It would be better: 3500 marks. us knowing SOMETHING because we know very little of the period between 3500-2500 BC. We just know that people left a very few tablets of writing. And to make things worse, people at that time did not registered things for posterity  they preferred oral tradition. What we can found is some useless accounting and tax declaration documents that at random were burned and turned in ceramic. The Sumerians used clay to record stuff, but they did not burn the clay, in fact they even recycled the tablets. They could be writing much time before that mark

               What i do not realize is actually how you are now not actually much more well-favored than you might be now. Youre very intelligent. You understand therefore considerably relating to this topic, produced me personally consider it from a lot of numerous angles. Its like men and women are not fascinated except it is something to do with Lady gaga! Your individual stuffs great. All the time handle it up!

               I believe you slipped up on that gastronomical figure 10^10^120, which should have been 10^120 years from now if it were the correctly written time of heat death.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also believe the heat death ends way before 10^10^120, when everything gets so bored that they behave in reverse, and 10^10^720 is actually the year that celebrates reincarnated Newton discovers apple when gravity collides with his cranium.

               Your statement about millennia and centuries starting on the one, rather than the zero, is quite incorrect.
              </p>
              <p>
               To understand why, we have to look at what, exactly, the AD calendar purports to date from.
              </p>
              <p>
               The AD calendar was invented as a calculation method for the date for Easter (a major controversy in the early church) by Dionysius Exiguus in the early 6th century.
              </p>
              <p>
               Easter dates needed to be set based on a 33 year cycle from the date of the Incarnation (when Mary putatively got knocked up by the Lord). After a review of history as he understood it, Dionysius Exiguus assigned a date for the Incarnation at 754 AUC (ab urbe conditia, the Roman calendar). He then assigned 1 AD to be the *next* year, 755 AUC, ie. the first anniversary of the Incarnation, 2 AD the year after that, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let me say that again. 1 AD is the *second* year in the AD calendar. 0 AD is implicit in the system; the Easter date would be determined by modulo 33 of the year in AD.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now whether Jesus birthdate was calculated correctly, or if he even existed, is irrelevant to this point. Whats relevant was that 2000 years from the start of the calendar is 2000 AD, not 2001.
              </p>
              <p>
               The misunderstanding comes from a mistake in the formation of the BC calendar, which occurred at the hands of a French astronomer in the 17th century, well after mathematical zero had entered the European canon. Though prior references to pre-Christian dates using the Christian calendar, such as those of Bede, had accepted the implicit zero in the AD system, when the BC system was formalized, 1 BC was tacked on where 0 AD should have been.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fast forward to the 1899 time period, when people who were generally educated, but understandably ignorant of the arcane details of the calendar of Dionysius Exiguus, made the leap there was no zero back then, to the AD calendar starts on 1, to the new century starts in 1901!  a conclusion based on false premises. This then grew into a snobby distinction between educated people, who incorrectly knew the century started in 1901, and the rabble, who correctly celebrated it in 1900, and was perpetuated a century later with elite  but misinformed  opinion around the millennium.
              </p>
              <p>
               So while it is true that there was no zero in European math when the AD calendar was devised, this does not mean that that the the calendar starts at 1 AD. The first year of the first century was 754 AUC, a year before 1 AD.
              </p>
              <p>
               And the millennium really was, as the rabble celebrated, on midnight 1/1/2000.

               The Faculty of IES Academy helps the students to complete the full syllabus
               <br/>
               before the exams well in advance, so that there would be enough time
               <br/>
               for the students to make the revision of the syllabus.

               Okay, I knew you said youd be using just some of the accepted theories and presenting them this way, but Is it really believed that humans took so long to develop language? Excuse me for being sceptical. Language is such a universal thing, with our enormous brains I cant believe we never formed a complex language until so long after the evolution of our big minds. I can very well imagine the societies were far simpler then, so they wouldnt have had need for many of the words we use today (like I dunno phone, sofa, emperor, bacteria, magazine, etc), but they must have surely had enough words to convey complex thoughts and emotions, no? Communication has always been a necessary part of cohabitation, more-so in increasingly complex societies.
               <br/>
               This makes me wonder when we started believing in a higher being or beings. Since religion appears in virtually every civilization, it must be something deeply ingrained in the fabric of our humanity. We seek answers, and it is the easiest answer to explain what was unexplainable. Hmm
               <br/>
               Also, you present the heat death of the Universe hypothesis as a fact, when it is only one of several hypotheses. (My favourite is that the gravity of everything in the Universe will be strong enough for it to contract until it once again reaches the pre-Big Bang state and then expands again, and does this over and over. Im wondering what the effect of the gravity of dark matter has on the likelihood of either of these possibilities.)

                 You are looking at language evolution after it all happened Imagine day 1 for humans where all you have are some grunts and mumblings. You got to get others to understand your sounds, not easy when you have no reading, no writing, no way of recording down progress, and you have to achieve all this in a 25 year average lifespan any progress that you do make in your lifetime is basically reset, until a breakthrough or genius hits the scene.

               Why cant we recalibrate our calendars using the beginning of earth as reference point instead of using religious event as reference(Birth of Christ)? I beleive it could help in brining a tremendous change in mindset. Imagine if the current year is counted as 4.5 Billion + 14 years..something like that.

                 Since the uncertainty in the age of the earth as of now is about 100 million, I think it would be a better idea to pick an arbitrary point in time close to now as the reference point, like was done for Unix time.

               A comment on comparing the lifespans of a 30 year old to a 90 year old todayI was noticing the section in parenthesis labeled real world.
              </p>
              <p>
               My father would have been turning 90. Most of his world was real. He related his experiences growing up on the West Side of Chicago in the 20s and 30s. A kid he knew was born with 6 fingers on one hand. That was that, he said, back then. Sink or swim. When a family member died they were layed out in the front parlor of his home(!). His Grandmother lost 4 of her children before age 3. His Mother lost 2. There werent a lot of street signs to stop cars from running into horses, or people. Immunizations were still a newfangled invention so families were quarantined with diphtheria or some-such-thing. Kids werent all expected to make it. Life wasnt all that hospitable. Because of this, Id say the real world parenthesis would span a much bigger segment of the 90 year olds life than the 30 year olds comparatively pampered life. Not that you care, maybe. But, some of us have longer childhoods nowadays. Before the real world needs to be dealt with. Just saying.

               So it still remains to be seen that no one knows the origin of life prior to the Big Bang. Just as no Christian knows the extent of Gods works before Genesis 1:1. I find these points to be amazing in their own right. Both science and religion still need to hold onto the same foundation and the foundation is faith. You need to believe something came from nothing on each front. Its an amazing place we live in and yet so much of us (including myself) get caught into the ways of the world and everyday life. I thank God for each day hes giving me and everyday that I will get to experience and I hope that one day when my time is up here; I can learn everything is to know about the universe.

                 The thing is, we know to that point you know, that doesnt require faith. The rest is speculation.

               Nice update. I was inspired by the comment on how someone born 55BC and who died in 35AD would have experienced much of what we now may consider important world events. I then looked at my own life in terms of personal milestones and important events and noticed that some years had clusters of BIG important events while other years were seemingly long, uneventful years of drudgery or perhaps mild boredom. Perhaps its all to do with what planets were doing at the time. I dont understand why modern sciences dismiss planetary influences when we can see what the Moon does to us every single month. Anyway, I think this sort of reflection may be useful for those people who are committed to living in the past and using events of 3000 years ago to govern their actions in the present. Damn fools.

               This is awesome, perspective of time put in the most clear, understandable way. So many events in history look more clear to me when placed in time like this. Human life span is so small compared to the events preceded in history.. Written and recorded history continue to marvel me about out achievements till date..

               The 90 vs. 30 year old example reminds me of something Ive been pondering for quite some time now, but rather than triple the lifespan, throughout my lifetime, Ive thought about what it means to double my life so far.  I think about how all the years leading up to now have felt like eons, and Im possibly about to endure them again.  Thats a-whole-nother X amount of years on top of the entire lifespan already lived.  I say, Im no where near middle aged yet.  I could live to be 120, so I wont even be middle aged until I turn 60.  If youre not close to middle age either, think of the prospect of doubling your life (13 to 26, 26 to 52, 39 to 78, 52 to 104, etc).   And you probably dont remember anything at all about the first 5 years of life.  Maybe in older years, memory will be elusive, too.  Nevertheless, most of us reading articles like this realize how fleeting life is, but the actual experience seems to take so long.  Whether long or short, the time were given is too precious to spend bogged down in negative shit.  With this illumination, were appreciating quality rather than quantity and reconsidering how best to spend our moments.  Older age or the next half of life is fraught with its own set of suckage, so might as well go into it without the extra layer of the first halfs suckage.

               Thank you for fascinating read! It might have helped to put some things into perspective, even as Im reading I get a baffled over the large time scales or what really isnt a very long time at all when it comes down to it. Ive only read this and the fermin paradox, but I have enjoyed them both very much. This is exactly the kind of site Ive been looking for and I will continue my exploration of this site.

               The new image is so huge that it doesnt render properly  I guess the best option would be to consider chopping it up into individual images for those using a non-mobile browser.

               Amazing post, thank you so much for writing this up! As far as I understand however, the collision with Andromeda isnt really a collision. It will be an amazing sight for anyone there to witness it, but as both galaxys are mostly vacuum, few (if any) objects will actually collide.

               I really liked this way of presenting data. It shows, visually to scale, how long a period of time really is, unlike simply writing down numbers. It seems like many people could quickly group one century, one millennium, one million years and one billion years into a single category called a really long time, without really understanding the difference. These graphs actually show that 200,000 years is ONE HUNDRED times longer than the time since Christ, making him an infant. Similiarly, it shows that as seemingly long as 200,000 years would be, it is microscopic when compared to how long life has existed on Earth.
               <br/>
               Another way to put time into perspective is to use the metric system, and set one millimeter equal to one year:
               <br/>
               On this scale, 1,000,000,000 millimeters equals the distance from Boston to Toronto and a century equals ten centimeters. Christ was born two meters ago, pyramids were built 4.5 meters ago.
               <br/>
               Modern humans, quoting the estimate of 200,000 years, have existed for a 200 meter sprint
               <br/>
               An old person, by todays standards, has lived ten centimeters. Think of all the human race has accomplished in such a tiny period of time!
              </p>
              <p>
               The fault with my system is that long distances can be hard to visualize, it is easy to visualize a millimeter or a  meter, but trying to visualize Boston to Toronto is much harder. However, I do give great thanks for the inventor of the metric system, since trying to do this with inches and miles would be impossible (it is 5,280 feet in a mile right?)

               the century starts at year 0, not at year 1.
               <br/>
               you dont born at 1 year old. your first year is between the born moment, and 1 year after that. completing 1 year makes you 1 year older.

               after 100 years, you are at year 100, not at year 101.

                 WRONG!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Your analogy isnt valid because in our calendar there IS NO YEAR ZERO.  Our calendar goes from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Think about it.  You are born and your age is 0.
                 <br/>
                 You live one year and your age is 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our calendar was born at age 1.  So after one year its age is 2.  So after 100 years, its
                 <br/>
                 age is 101.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It all depends on where you start counting.  If you start counting at 0, then yes, you would be correct.  But we dont start counting years at 0, we start counting at 1.  So the last digit of the first year of a century or millennium is a 1.  The VERY FIRST century began with a 1, thus every subsequent decade/century/millennium must also start on the 1 year.  Otherwise, you lose a year somewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look at it another way.  What is the name of the current century in which we are living?  Thats right, its the 21st century, not the 20th century even though our counter for centuries says 20.  Again, this is because we begin counting centuries starting at 1.  There was no zeroth century.  We started with the first century.
                </p>
                <p>

                 said, similar: a ruler. the first centimeter is from 0 to 1.  This is true but only because you began counting at 0.  Instead start counting at centimeter 1 and measure ten centimeters. Where do you end up?  You end up at 11.  When you start counting at 1 (which is how we do it with years), the first centimeter is from 1 to 2.  The tenth centimeter is from 10 to 11.  Thus the beginning of the next ten centimeters begins at 11.  The eleventh centimeter goes from 11 to 12 and the rest so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is the same problem most people have when starting to learn programming, especially when dealing with arrays.  An array that has 100 members would be defined by indexes 0 through 99.  Most beginners will try to access the last member in the array by writing array[100] because the array has 100 members.  This seems logical, however this logic will throw an error because the last member of the array is array[99].  array[100] is not defined.  The same goes for the first member of an array.  The first member of the array is array[0] not array[1].
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thus
                </p>
                <p>
                 Print YEAR[0];  // returns 1
                 <br/>
                 Print YEAR[10];  // returns 11
                 <br/>
                 Print YEAR[1900];  // returns 1901 (this is the 19th hundred year)
                 <br/>
                 Print YEAR[2000];  // returns 2001 (this is the first year of the new millennium)
                </p>
               </div>

                   oh damn thats so wrong, please take your time to think about the first centimeter goes from 0 to 1. the first year (of course there is not year 0, or centimeter 0) is considered until reaching the end of year one. this is like this in everything. you cant skip stuff. sadly.

                    <p>
                     AGAIN, the first centimeter goes from 0 to 1 because YOU STARTED at 0.  The first year goes from 1 to 2 because YOU START at 1.  It really is that simple.

                     Do you remember seeing a number line in elementary school?  Remember how it went -2, -1, 0, 1, 2?  Our calendar DOES NOT do this.  It goes 2 BC, 1 BC, 1 AD, 2 AD.  The first year BC goes from 1 BC to 1 AD.  And the first year AD goes from 1 AD to 2 AD.  So after 10 years (a decade), the new decade starts at 11 AD (same thing for centuries and millennia).
