      Famous Men on Golf
     </h1>
     <p>
      Winston Churchill: Golf is like chasing a quinine pill around a cow pasture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jack Benny: Give me the fresh air, a beautiful partner, and a nice round of golf, and you can keep the fresh air and the round of golf.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lee Trevino: You can make a lot of money in this game. Just ask my ex-wives. Both of them are so rich that neither of their husbands work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unknown: Golf is not a game, its bondage. It was obviously devised by a man torn with guilt, eager to atone for his sins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hank Aaron: It took me seventeen years to get 3,000 hits in baseball. I did it in one afternoon on the golf course.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lee Trevino: Columbus went around the world in 1492. That isnt a lot of strokes when you consider the course.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lee Trevino: Im not saying my golf game went bad, but if I grew tomatoes, theyd come up sliced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sam Snead: These greens are so fast I have to hold my putter over the ball and hit it with the shadow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paul Harvey: Golf is a game in which you yell fore, shoot six, and write down five.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tommy Bolt, about the tempers of modern players: They throw their clubs backwards, and thats wrong. You should always throw a club ahead of you so that you dont have to walk any extra distance to get it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tommy Bolt: Putting allows the touchy golfer two to four opportunities to blow a gasket in the short space of two to forty feet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jimmy Demaret: Golf and sex are about the only things you can enjoy without being good at.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jack Lemmon: If you think its hard to meet new people, try picking up the wrong golf ball.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lee Trevino: If youre caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unknown: Seventy years ago, 100 white men chasing one black man across a field was called the Ku Klux Klan. Today its called the PGA Tour.
     </p>
     <p>
      John Updike: Golf appeals to the idiot in us and the child. Just how childlike golf players become is proven by their frequent inability to count past five.
     </p>
     <p>
      Silk Stockings TV Show: The people who gave us golf and called it a game are the same people who gave us bagpipes and called it music.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gerald Ford: I would like to deny all allegations by Bob Hope that during my last game of golf, I hit an eagle, a birdie, an elk and a moose.
     </p>
     <p>
      P. G. Wodehouse: The least thing upsets him on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of butterflies in the adjoining meadows.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bob Hope: If Im on the course and lightning starts, I get inside fast. If God wants to play through, let him.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ken Harrelson: In baseball you hit your home run over the right-field fence, the left-field fence, the center-field fence. Nobody cares. In golf everything has got to be right over second base.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chi Chi Rodriguez: The first time I played the Masters, I was so nervous I drank a bottle of rum before I teed off. I shot the happiest 83 of my life.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chi Chi Rodriguez: After all these years, its still embarrassing for me to play on the American golf tour. Like the time I asked my caddie for a sand wedge and he came back ten minutes later with a ham on rye.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tommy Bolt, toward the end of one of his infamous high-volume, temperamental club-throwing rounds, asked his caddie for a club recommendation for a shot of about 155 yards. His caddie said: Id say either a 3-iron or a wedge, sir. A 3-iron or a wedge? asked Bolt. What kind of stupid choice is that? Those are the only two clubs you have left, sir. said the caddie.
