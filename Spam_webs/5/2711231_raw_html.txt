        One of my favorite moments occurred in Ft. Lauderdale, circa 1979.  It was a wet t-shirt contest at I believe

Penrod's or The Candy Store.  A

woman strolled out, with the most hugest breasticles I have ever seen. Rick James' song
        <b>
         "Give It To Me Baby"
        </b>
        started to play, and she grabbed her mammalia and swung them back and forth to the

beat.  I just stood there... absolutely speechless.  I love that memory.

        Rick was another poster boy for excess. He came complete with a 1994 stint in

prison for keeping a woman hostage and burning her with a crack pipe (as you do)

in the Argyll Hotel on the Sunset Strip.

        Okay, I stand corrected. According to a

friend of Findadeath, " He was NOT found guilty of burning a woman with a crack pipe.......he was found innocent of that offense and did not do time for that.  Plus the 'so called' crack pipe incident did not occur at the Argyle hotel.  Just to get facts straight.....he went to prison for 2 things 1) cocaine possession (duh) and 2) for assaulting a woman at the Argyle hotel (different woman).  The woman and Tanya were fighting over some bullshit and the woman kicked Tanya in her stomach....Tanya was 8 months pregnant with Taz at the time.  Sooooo.....Rick lost his mind on her and admits he probably wouldn't have to that extent if he weren't high.  But he basically just punched her in the face a few times for what she did.  He's no angel, but holding someone hostage &amp; burning her with a crack pipe is a pretty insane thing to get dubbed for doing.  Punching someone is, I suppose, fairly 'normal aggressive behavior!' Whatever, it just pisses me off when I read shit and I'm sure you got the info from something you read."

        James suffered a stroke after his release from prison in 1998, months after he had hip replacement surgery.

He was also diabetic, and had a pace maker. He was honored in June at the 17th annual Rhythm &amp; Soul Awards. As he surveyed the smooth glass surface of the award, he said, "Years ago, I would have used this for something totally different.

Cocaine's a hell of a drug."

He moved out of his house because he was renting it and the owner decided to sell -- and Rick didn't want to buy that house.  He was having a very hard time finding a house to buy so he stayed in some hotels and then went to the Oakwood in the meantime.

He was probably there for about 6 months or so.  The last couple of months he was there, Jamie Foxx was going to produce a realty show on him and was helping him look for a house in Beverly Hills that he could live in and use for the show.

        <br/>
        Thursday 8/5 he was going to sleep -- he said he was going back on the road with Teena Marie in a few days and needed his rest.  He got under the

covers, and died some time that night. He was found in bed. Officially he was last seen alive by his assistant in the afternoon of August 5, 2004.  At around 9:30 the next morning she tried waking him, and found him cold and unresponsive.  She called the paramedics and he was pronounced dead at
9:52 a.m.

        A "female friend" reported to a tabloid

that she spent the previous evening with Rick, and that he was "high for an

entire week straight prior to his death." She also said that Rick

told her that his "stroke gave him a twitch that only cocaine could

ease."

Rick's system, as well as proof that Rick did indeed eat his vegetables. According to

Sheridan sends us this:

One of the funniest things I have ever heard was either on the "Grammy's" or the "American Music Awards" in the mid-80's.  Rick James was a 'presenter' with the 'ever-scary' Grace Jones. Grace had on a hat? that could only be described as ......looking like a toy that was around in the 60's.....looked like a propeller inside a 'hula-hoop' that was tossed around like a 'Frisbee'. Mr. James looks at Grace (RJ is obviously high)......then looks down into front row of the audience and says "Hey Stevie, you should see this!" Gasps mixed with laughter as the camera cuts to Stevie Wonder.

Thanks Paul. One of these days I'll tell you about an interesting evening

I had with Grace.

Oh oh, I did meet Tanya Hijazi (Rick James' ex-wife) ... Pretty funny, we were

lamenting the assholes that are our baby daddies, but she never let on who

hers was. She was showing soccer pics of Taz all proud-like and it all seemed so

familiar to me. Hmm. So I googled her when I got home. She's beautiful in

person, but seemed rather troubled. I guess being convicted with the Superfreak

for burning a chick with a crack pipe will do that to you.

          I have been a big fan of your page since the

    early days. You are a beautiful queen for doing this. I wanted to know

    if you were aware that Rick James was the nephew of Melvin Franklin (the bass

    singer of the Temptations--yeah, I saw thelink to his pagesoI

    guess you do) but in the song "SuperFreak" near the end he

    shouts out "Temptations Sing!" and that's really them! He also did

    their comeback song "Standing on the Top" and shouts the same

    thing in the first chorus. You really have to do a story about the

    Temptations, since four out of five of them are dead. The miniseries was a

    trip and Leon was a dead ringer for David Ruffin.

            Many people thought that

      legendary singer and bass player Rick James would be giving out millions

      of dollars after his death. "CJ" has Rick's will and exclusive

      details on what he left behind.

           Classics like "Super

      Freak" made the late Rick James the phenom of funk, but despite

      selling millions of records, it turns out the man born James Ambrose

      Johnson, Jr., a.k.a. Rick James, left an estate worth less than $250,000

      according to court records.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Nonetheless, attorney Steffeny Holtz, who once represented James and is

      now the lawyer for Ty James, one of the singer's three children, told

      "CJ" that Rick's music will generate lots of income for his heir

      for decades.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "You can't just look at that

      number," Holtz insisted of James' estate. "That's a number

      that moves all the time. Every time they play 'Super Freak,' it

      generates income for the estate."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And there's even more music to come, Holtz revealed: "Rick was

      working with some artists right before he passed away. I know Kanye West

      was working with Rick."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Who knows what a combo of rap star Kanye

      (known for "Through the Wire") and Rick might have produced?

      "There's a lot of music still that's going to come out," Holtz

      confirmed. "And you'll hear it, and it is good stuff. There are some

      surprises in store."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The future may look bright, but sources tell "CJ" that Rick's

      legal problems are what depleted his estate. James reportedly paid $1.8

      million to a woman who sued him after he pleaded no contest to assault,

      and he struggled in other ways. The coroner's report listed cocaine, meth,

      Valium and Vicodin in his system, concluding that James died from a heart

      attack.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "He had heart issues and medical

      problems, so he may have turned to some of those prescription-type drugs

      and other things to help him with the pain," Holtz admitted, but

      insisted that, while James did struggle, the huge crowd that turned out

      for his funeral shows he was rich in the most important ways: in

      friendship and in spirit. "He was one of the most generous people
      I've ever had the fortune to meet. And he's up there laughing at us

      all because he got every penny out of his life. The legacy goes on."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Holtz says a foundation is being considered in Rick's memory and that he

      even wrote a book that will soon be released. The title? "Memoirs of

      a Super Freak."
