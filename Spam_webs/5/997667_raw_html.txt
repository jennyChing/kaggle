           An off-grid homeschool family of 12 in rural Kentucky was raided, the mother arrested, and the 10 children seized simply because the government disagrees with their lifestyle and their educational choices, family members and friends say.
          </p>
          <p>
           Until Wednesday, Joe and Nicole Naugler lived with their 10 kids in a cabin on 26 acres in Breckinridge County, about an hour southwest of Louisville.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are an extremely happy family, family friend Pace Ellsworth told
           <em>
            Off The Grid News
           </em>
           .

           Acting on an anonymous tip about the familys off-grid lifestyle, sheriffs officers entered the property and home Wednesday, and even blocked the access road to the family property, the family says. Joe and eight of the children were away, but Nicole  who is five-months pregnant  was home with the two oldest kids. Sheriff deputies then seemingly allowed Nicole and the two children to drive away but they got only a short distance before deputies pulled them over and took the two children away from the mom, who was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. (She says the arrest took place after she did not passively allow deputies to take the children.) Nicole was able to contact her husband and have a brief conversation.

           Later, the sheriff ordered Joe to turn over the other children by 10 a.m. or be arrested for felony charges, the family says. He complied.
          </p>
          <p>
           Deputies also threatened to impound the car, although a friend of the family convinced the deputies to allow Joe to have it back, the family says.

           The family may be off grid, but they arent anonymous. In fact, they have Internet, as well as a Facebook page dating back to 2012 where they frequently post pictures and videos of their children, animals and their off-grid life. A May 5 post showed a video of a toddler, Mosiah, learning to walk. An April 24 post showed a happy family, gathering around a campfire, roasting marshmallows.
          </p>
          <p>
           They also post pictures alluding to their faith. Their

            Facebook page

            which has nearly 2,000 likes  is called My Blessed Little Homestead.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ellsworth believes the arrests took place because of their simple way of life that some would call backwards  and because of the way they homeschool. The familys Facebook page calls it a back to basics life. They have a garden and raise chickens and goats. Deputies apparently were concerned about whether the childrens needs were being met.

          </p>
          <p>
           In an official form the family posted online, Kentuckys version of Child Protective Services said the children were not living in appropriate conditions and not enrolled in school. Another official form even complained there was no fence around the pond.

           In unschooling, there is no set curriculum and the education is based on each childs strength.
          </p>
          <p>
           You let your kids decide the curriculum, Ellsworth told
           <em>
            Off The Grid News
           </em>
           . In unschooling, education doesnt take a backseat. Its listening to what theyre interested in and fascinated in.

           This is the natural way to live, he said. Its actually a growing movement. They want to have a personal education and not a factory education.

           Ellsworth called it whole-life homeschooling.

             That country needs their pants sued off!!!  Its difficult though, CPS is a powerful entity, and most lose their kids until they grow out of the system!  After their return back, its never the same!  Been there, done that!

             Homeschooling and not being a member of HSLDA is like driving without a license hoping never to be stopped.

            <p>
             I dont know if this family are members of HSLDA or not but I kind of doubt it because most agencies dont like messing with a room full of lawyers. On the other hand, 10 kids and their parents would be considered appetizers.

             This is just so wrong! give them back their children and leave them alone. I think they have plenty of reason to sue. They did nothiNg wrong and now their kids have probably been traumatized. Just because they choose to live away from all of the toxic elements and people doesnt make them wrong. I would love to do the same.

             Id love to see the police/child protective services report as this article, and many others, implies that CPS was involved due to a lacking education/ homeschooling (very unlikely). We love to use trigger words to sensationalize stories ultimately distracting from the truth/reason for occurrence. It was indicated that the housing unit, supporting 12 individuals (with apparently a 13th on the way,) was 384 sq ft with NO running water. The article misleads the reader  by making statements such as, 10 kids in a cabin on 26 acres and they have Internet, as well as a Facebook page dating back to 2012. The article conveniently uses the acreage number (26) to imply the cabin size is larger than its actual dimensions. Additionally, the article paints a picture of normality simply by mentioning the families Facebook account, dating back 3 years. Lets hope the internet bill wasnt the reason for an insufficient clean/consistent water supply (sorry, poor humor on my end). The above living situation was more than likely the cause, not homeschooling. Even the local Amish, off-grid homeschooling community, have running water and sufficient space for their 16 plus size families. Lets not forget to note that the Duggars (popular show 19 kinds and counting) are not harassed by authorities although they homeschool. It is essential to compare both families with the  only glaring difference being that the Duggars provided suitable living conditions.  Personal opinion pieces litter the internet distracting the reader from the basic fact that the living conditions were not being provided to the children. Yes, the family had a Facebook account that showed how happy they always were. Dont we all have a Facebook that shows only the brightest and best of ourselves and families? Again, I would love to see the official arrest record, not personal opinion pieces.

               If your suspicions are correct, shouldnt CPS have first scheduled an appointment to come and investigate the living conditions?

              <p>
               A small house with no running water still provides more love and security than and foster home. Foster homes will always come up 2nd best and can even be seriously abusive situations.
              </p>
              <p>
               If CPS had a case, they did not go about it in a very professional way.

                 It is a small stick shack with an open wall. CPS removed the kids because of garbage and broken glass all overdeplorable living conditions. The kids are not even enrolled in homeschool which is illegal. They have no ss numbers or birth certificates. They have been hurt on the property (cut and burned) while being denied medical care. The parents have had CPS called on the multiple times all over texas and kentucky but they run and move to a new place to avoid investigation. The father has already had his parental rights severed from his oldest kid in TX due to abuse. These people are a piece of work for sure!!!

                   Im sorry but what your saying is that if my child gets hurt on my property and I feel that I can adequately deal with the injury so that they heal safely thats not my right as a parent? Should children be taken because their parents dealt with injury at home? CPS is an unchecked monster that should not be trusted.

                   Not raising the children properly, hmmm so you think video games, junk food, violent television, and a sexualized world are better for them???? Maybe the wrong parents are being punished here. Our values are completely screwed up in this country. Last I checked they said we were a free society, guess not. Maybe these people actually paid attention to their children instead of putting them in day care or in front of the tv.

                     So agree, April. I guess its more admirable to live on welfare and be the mother of six, all different sperm donors, and no father in the house, no support, mother unemployed, fathers unknown. Yep, now theres parenting!

                    <p>
                     Send CPS to Baltimore and Ferguson, and let them improve the life of a poor city kid and stay away from people like this. Makes you sick.

                     You are right on the money! Kids that are raised away from electronics and all the TV filth grow up to be much better human beings, kinder, more compassionate, neighborly, etc. etc.

                 The issue is that we think the government, in this case CPS, is the best judge of what is good or bad for American children. From my own work experience working with that agency, I do not think that is the case. Weve been brainwashed to believe a K-12 education in a government school is the only way to raise kids (which has only been the norm for less than a century).

                 what the above article fails to mention as well as many as the other articles found online today, is that joe was arrested 3 * for bad behavior. Also that the z haszCPS has been involved with the family since 2012. This is not a first time occurrence or interaction w. Also c_p_swith the CPS. Also, by its own description, and the laws of the state of Kentucky, Un-schooling is not home schooling. Repeat it is not home schooling by the laws of Kentucky. What is being presented is a bunch of sensationalised falsehoods and half truths.

                   So suddenly all these state statutes over-rule the right to happiness in America? Since when was that the case? Since when did a state law over-rule the supreme law of the land? Marbury vs.Madison 1803 A Law repugnant to the constitution is void. and this Un-schooling law is nothing more than a clear violation of ones right to happiness and life.

                 The above article is like so many others that have been popping up all over the internet in the last few days. Full of outrageous sensationalism, 1/2 truths, and absolute misinformation. This is not the fisrt time that this family has had run-ins with the law, or CPS. Look up Joes previous arrest records. They have had dealings with CPS since around 2012, just in Ky alone. wonder how many other states before then.
                 <br/>
                 Also, they are NOT HOMESCHOOLERS! By their own definition they are UN-schoolers No matter what pretty little stories they want to make up, un-schooling is NOT HOMESCHOOLING. Either by its own description, Or the statutes of the state of Kentucky.
                 <br/>
                 There is a lot more to this story than what appears in the headlines. And most everyplace I have looked so far, the story is being mistold,  and innacurate information spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But hey, that is what people want to hear, right?

                 Please really research this deeper, and think with your mind instead of reacting to your emotional heartstrings which are being utilized for various media outlets gain. As well as gaining public support for someone who is not revealing the truth in their socialmedia posts!

                   Know the family and they are horrid people! The churches around here dont even want to help them anymore. They lie, cheat, steal, and bully. Its sickening hear people who are supporting them. Ive been in their last home they were renting and a local church was paying their rent. Human feces EVERYWHERE !! Even all over the walls. Yes they were reported. The babies bottoms were red and chaffed. They had no clothes on. The one toddler was limping because he ran a nail through his foot and she would not seek medical attention. A member of a local church who was a nurse came over and looked at it and gave medical care. These people are filthy and sick! They brainwash their kids and I do believe they were and are abused. Someone told me of a post they read one time that was deleted and an anonymous person states that Joe did something horrible to a young girl and that he doesnt know how he sleeps at night If you support this family, YOU have got a problem and are the problem!! Trust me I know and so do hundreds of other good people who they have conned, stole from and bullied!! This was all pre planned. Every bit of it. From the audio to the websites and you bunch of idiots gave them 30,000. Do you think they are going to do something good with that? Really?! Than you are pretty stupid!!

                     I read elsewhere that someone had gone to the trailer that they at one time inhabited, and also found the kids running around, that there was feces everywhere.
                     <br/>
                     It is deeply of concern to me that social media permits people to present a spin on their existence and I think this is what the Naughlers are doing  to gain support and donations.
                     <br/>
                     These children are not on a homestead, they are living in squalor.  Why is the father not working?  Why do they not accept some government assistance so they can get back on their feet?  Why is Mom putting thousands of $$ fundraised into a pet grooming salon- really? - instead of finding a decent job to support the family.
                     <br/>
                     These people made the religiously-based, but I believe, erroneous decision to continue having children they have no means to properly support.
                     <br/>
                     Just because you are Christian does not mean you cant use condoms.    The parents are breeding like rabbits and living off church donations and GoFundMe?

                   Well now I want to hear the recordgs. I did exactly what you suggested prior to reading this post. I agree 100%  facts 1st. Id love to have had many kids and would not mind homeschooling. But Id make sure they had clean running water before an Internet connection! Dont know much more about it. Looks like everyone has run out of their know-it-all prescriptions and will now need to take their shut up and sit down pills. Haha.

                 They did.   The mother started abusing the cop and the father ran away.  She was arrested DURING the initial contact visit.  CPS came  into the picture  as a consequence of her nutty behavior.  Off the grid is fine.  Homeschooling is fine.  Living in fecal filth in a lean to in winter is NOT fine.   Dont associate off grid living with these nuts.  They are abusing their children.

                   and how would you act if someone came to get your kids? You wouldnt look a little crazy or mad? You think youre above that, but bad things do happen to good people. You are judging them from the outside. You are trusting what ever anyone reports. Dont judge, it will come back to you.

                     Look at the living conditions on FB.  Some of the people on here should be ashamed of themselves for thinking its ok to raise children under those living conditions!  Those children deserve better!  CPS did the right thing by coming in and taking the children!  I bet 99% of the people on here would not live the way these kids are living! Shame on all of you who think its ok and shame on you for defending these parents!

                 CPS would not be called in for the home schooling or being off the grid, they are not conditions for removal from a home. Article is a bit misleading.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hell, you only need to have a fresh water source (not running water).

                <p>
                 This is starting to sound like the loonies in Texas who are worried that the federal government is coming to take over the state.

                 Anna and your point is???  Who are you or anyone else to dictate how one should live their life?  Unfortunately, there are many of your kind who spend 50 percent or more of your time each day, browsing every page following other peoples lives on Facebook!  Your lives must be exremely unfulfilling!  Not only do you spend hours living other peoples lives YOU have to judge and share your self-serving opinions on what is an acceptable way of living to YOU in this already very controlled and conditioned society!  Get a life!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Live your unfulfilling and boring life of daily being glued on FB.  Be brain washed and conditioned with all the negativity and foolishness of society on television.  Consume all the latest disposable electronics, gadgets and fashions for temporary and meaningless pleasure.  Use recycled water treated with chlorine and other chemicals that are actually more harmful and may be the cause of illnesses. Consume chemically sprayed and injected food with hormones that make you fat and sick!  Look at your belly and thighs!
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Nuagler family  live a praisable life!   One has to persevere,   be resourceful, creative and courageous  in order to live their way of life.  While you I am sure and many others are unable to survive a single night because you will be taken away from what  you and your societys definition of an ideal  and standard way of life is.  Possesing all your conveniences in life and material possessions obviously does not fulfill your life.  Youre obviously more interested in the Nauglers way of living.  In a scenerio where survival is required; I am sure the Naugler family will succeed in surviving and living a comfortable life than you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This culture and society imposing its twisted, selfish and arrogant standards and beliefs on how others should live destroy people and their families. How shameful and scandalous!

                   30K? Lets instead help those that are truly going thru hardships that treat elderly and children how they are supposed to. Children (my opinion) should be cherished as a blessing, not a money fuelled right to have / own. Disgusting!

                   And if the documented living conditions are correct, Ill live my unfulfilling life feces free. Thank you  for those that need it, feces is same as poop or shit. Not even my dog will shit where he eats or sleeps. Just sad. Outhouse is one thing .. but just over that log, not acceptable.

               Good point. But if they are healthy and happy who has the right to take their children. I am sure if the kids are separated and placed in foster care they ARE NOT HAPPY.

               If all that is true (which to be honest was my inclination as well) they should have sent CPS out to speak with the family and file a report on the living conditions. Not just show up and take their kids away!!!

               I absolutely agree with Anna! This article is sensational. Having Facebook is not an indicator to good parenting. Homeschooling is not the real issue here. Children do not get taken away because they have been home-schooled. CPS usually works with families before such a drastic step as to remove the children. A plan is usually set into motion and resources made available to assist the parents in fixing issues. The last step, if the parents are not able or not willing to comply with the plan (which can take from 6 months to several years) is to remove the children. I am not buying

                 Worked in CPS and Foster Care for over 10 years.  Saw the gamut of referrals from people who had their own idea about what is normal for families and children, even if there was no harm to the children.  They seem to think that everyone should be programmed to behave/look like everyone else.  Somewhere in some circles there is the idea that children belong to the government.  WRONG!  Our founding fathers would be appalled to see how easily we give up our freedoms, simply because someone chooses to live  differently than the norm as defined by someone else.

                   You are right on. ALL of our ancestors of old would have had their children taken from todays cps. Maybe some people want to learn how to live without dependence on our modern vacuum of a system. I do. It is difficult to break out of that dependence and for most its even harder to break out of the co-dependent thinking of everyone that defends the system as the only way to live.

                     the fact is, your ancestors would birth 12 children, and pray that only ten would die before age ten. Thats no longer acceptable behavior, because you have better options now! If you choose to literally live on a pile of broken glass and human feces (as these people did), then yes you can expect us to intervene!

                   Uh yeah no. There are no circles in which people actually believe that their children belong to the government. You sir are spouting shrill, hyperbolic nonsense. Run along home Chicken Little, the sky is not falling.

                 Well, by todays standards I would have been taken away from my parents because we had an out house for a bathroom and no running water! I am 50 years old and some of the best times of my life where when we did not have indoor plumbing, electricity and we carried our water in! To bad our government and the pissy cry baby people couldnt be more concerned with the parents who where sexually molesting and beating me, then the ones who where raising me off grid! Our society is so fucked up, I dont hold out much hope!

                   The problem seems to be not that they did not have access to water. That is very different from not having running water. According to what I have read, the father was confronted by their neighbor for stealing the neighbors water. When the neighbor confronted him, he sent his son to get a gun from the glovebox.

                 Having dealt with CPS, they can make up whatever lies, twist your words, and take your kids on the spot if they feel they are in immediate danger. When they come out to investigate  they are looking for reasons to take your children. If they stop taking children, how many people would be out of work? Unlike criminal court, they dont have to prove youre guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, just that there is a 51% chance it may have happened.

                 Heck, I found that and more on the families own Facebook page.
                 <br/>
                 Except there the Mom says the open air shack is just 300 square feet.
                 <br/>
                 And the reason the cops were really there was the father stole water from a Niebuhr, threatens her with a gun and then called her a c***.
                 <br/>
                 Heck, the mother admits as much on their own Facebook page.
                 <br/>
                 Go read it and look at the pictures of filthy and injured kids living in a filthy and uninsalated shack with out even an outhouse or running water.
                 <br/>
                 This family is very lucky they havent lost a child to accident or infection.
                 <br/>
                 O, and I was raised homeschooled in a log cabin in Alaska, and it was NOTHING like the filthy, dangerous squalor you see on these folks own Facebook page.
                 <br/>
                 Go look for yourself.

               Well, apparently DCBS (thats what we call them here in Kentucky) checked the home out and had no concerns.  Since they have some pretty specific criteria, Ill take their word for it and not yours.  These children need to be returned to this amazing home.

                 Not true. Go look at this families own Facebook page, she posted a photo of the report, it says there was filth and broken glass everywhere.
                 <br/>
                 Heck, if you took 10 seconds to go look at the families own Facebook page you would see that for yourself.

                 These kids may have as well been living in a hole in the ground.

                 Amazing home? You must be joking. Its an open air shack with tarps for a roof. There is no running water and they dont even have an outhouse which means they either just go wherever and whenever the feel inclined or that there is s designated hole filled with foul waste. Beyond that, they arent even teaching their children, instead choosing to indulge basic life skills pining for the days before oublic education, actually believing the glory days were a time when the population at large was illiterate.

                   a time when the population at large was illiterate would be when, exactly?  Do you presume that literacy increased because of factory-programming industrial/government education?  Before the legal compulsion to attend government schools, most children were educated at home, and literacy rates were higher then than now.

                     For the later part of this century the illiteracy rates have been relatively low, registering only about 4 percent as early as 1930. However, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, illiteracy was very common. In 1870, 20 percent of the entire adult population was illiterate, and 80 percent of the black population was illiterate. By 1900 the situation had improved somewhat, but still 44 percent of blacks remained illiterate. The statistical data show significant improvements for black and other races in the early portion of the 20th century as the former slaves who had no educational opportunities in their youth were replaced by younger individuals who grew up in the post Civil War period and often had some chance to obtain a basic education. The gap in illiteracy between white and black adults continued to narrow through the 20th century, and in 1979 the rates were about the same.

                     You are right that public schools were created because they needed the people that worked in the mills and factories to be able to read and write as so many people were illiterate.

                     For the later part of this century the illiteracy rates have been relatively low, registering only about 4 percent as early as 1930. However, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, illiteracy was very common. In 1870, 20 percent of the entire adult population was illiterate, and 80 percent of the black population was illiterate. By 1900 the situation had improved somewhat, but still 44 percent of blacks remained illiterate. The statistical data show significant improvements for black and other races in the early portion of the 20th century as the former slaves who had no educational opportunities in their youth were replaced by younger individuals who grew up in the post Civil War period and often had some chance to obtain a basic education. The gap in illiteracy between white and black adults continued to narrow through the 20th century, and in 1979 the rates were about the same.

               Why is it not the parents choice how to raise and educate their children?  What right to you have to judge them or where and how they live?  The children are all well-nourished and well appearing.  Perhaps youre the person who made the anonymous report.  Government should NEVER act on an anonymous report of anything.  There has to be some proof first  some reason to believe a crime has been committed.  It is not a crime to live off the grid, nor is it a crime to homeschool ones children.  Now the children are separated not only from their parents, but from each other.  How much damage has that done and will that continue to do to these children?  Anna, and supporters, you are the perfect example of government indoctrination and blind allegiance to the fallacy that government will take care of us.

                 I fully agree with your statement.  This whole article is bull crap!  These children need to be returned to their parents immediately.  Sounds like some busy body nosy individual has caused this problem unnecessarily.  Now there is great hardship on this family.

                 The cops got called because the father stole water from a neighbor, threatens this neighbor buy asking his child to go get my gun out of the car and then called this neibor a c***.

                 Youre right, homeschooling is not illegal. Its just too bad for you self righteous and indignant argument that what these parents are doing is not considered homeschooling by either themselves nor the state of Kentucky. Oh, and you can get down off your high horse any time now

               So I take it you were the anonymous tip? People live like this all over the world and we think this is wrong just because things have progressed in our country? Go on a missions trip, stop being ignorant.

                 Look at all the families in Eastern KY, are all those kids going to be taken from their parents because they are poor and live in the poorest part of the state?  I have often said, we birth the children but they are not ours, they are the governments.

               I think you, Anna, need to be more concerned about the so-called public-school educated children who come from single-parent homes,  who have siblings from different fathers, who live in more deplorable conditions, surrounded by drug pushers and addicts,  living in small filthy apartments, etc., etc., etc. and have no solid mentors teaching them skills for living life without milking of the tax-payers.  Because this family is a home-school family, they are targeted out.  The government HATES home-schoolers because it cant brainwash them.  The parents ARE the PARENTS, the government is NOT!

                   With no curriculum to speak of and the children allowed to pursue whatever piques their interest I sincere doubt that reading and math and a basic understanding of history are high up on the list.

                 I dont want to mistake because USA aint my country but in mine (France) people are brainwashed thinking their taxes are sucked by the non working parasites. The truth, those helps come from other budgets, but the taxes are used to pay those crazily hight politician salaries and its also this money they use for extortions and also to pay for expensive researchs on  how to cure the disease that the product I want to sell causes. So be carefull, check how the us budget is handled, because you might have been brainwashed into hating poor lost people.

                   Oh theyre brainwashed all right. Half the crazies and loons constantly whine about government assistance to the poor and destitute ignoring the fact that the sum is paltry in comparison to corporate subsidies/revenue lost via favorable tax codes and loop holes. Not even going to get into their love affair with all things related to defense spending

                 The Nauglers are not being targeted because theyre homeschoolers.  We dont know if the children can read and write, therefore we cant say if they are getting an education at home.  Just because the children receive some education at home doesnt mean they are better or worse off than students who attend school.

               Were the material conditions of the Nauglers domicile the real reason for this Nanny state aggression, wouldnt you have listed some sort of action taken by the authoritarians to secure mitigation BEFORE their armed goons swept in to engage in thuggery against this family?

               I agree with some of your statements.  All media articles seem biased and rarely give ALL of the information.  However, after watching these cases unfold all across the nation, what irks me is that the parents are never arrested for the neglect.  If the living arrangements are enough to constitute the removal of the children, it should also constitute the arrest of both parents.  You should not be able to take children for a long period of time without an arrest being made.  Its not logical and it doesnt go in line with our Constitutional rights!

               you know not having running water is no big deal, I grew up with no running water and oh no no indoor bathroom  or shower  we took baths in a tub usually out in the yard (no traffic there). and i grew up fine . Most of my grandchildren are being home schooled,nothing wrong with that either.

                 Did yall steal your water from your neighbors?
                 <br/>
                 Thats what brought the authorities to this family, the neighbor caught the dad stealing water at which point Mr. Nagler told his son to go get a gun. Then the neighbor called the cops.
                 <br/>
                 If you caught someone on your land stealing water and confronted them and they responded by telling their child to go get a gun, what would you do? Wait to be shot?

               The CPS should not have been able to take the kids because of no running water. I live in Alaska and about 30% of families are off the grid without running water. There is nothing wrong with raising your kids in a small cabin without running water. Bunch of state idiots taking away kids from a loving family that meets all the kids needs without abuse is on the rise and is completely ridiculous. Dont forget there are billions of kids without running water throughout the world. It is not about running water it is about access to water. As long as the children had access to water for drinking and occasional baths the CPS should not have the right to take the kids or intervene. If this happened were I live the CPS workers would probably had been shot at. No joke.

                 I grew up off grid in Alaska too, but this family is NOT living in a cabin go look on their Facebook if you doubt me.
                 <br/>
                 They are living in s 300 square  foot shack with no stove, no insulation, no windows and only three walls.
                 <br/>
                 The dont just have no well, they dont even have a barrel stove to cook on or an outhouse.
                 <br/>
                 On their Facebook you can see the kids are covered in filth and cook their own food over a fire pit.
                 <br/>
                 This isnt homesteading, its Lord of the flies set in Kentucky.

                 Then the parents would be taken away for murder/attempted murder and never get to see their children again. You dont have the right to shoot at federal agents enforcing lawful orders all because you disagree with said order and are more inclined towards violent tantrums than you are rational discourse.

               The husband threatened to kill a neighbor for stealing water, the neighbor called cps that the homestead has no water, toilets, or walls, just some tarps even in coldest winter with a newborn . Cps came to do a welfare check and she went crazy on them- so they arrested her and took custody of kids. I had to do quite a bit of looking for actual story. The parents are clearly not owning their part in this.

               the famous Dolly Parton lived that lifestyle and turned out just fine. Nothing wrong with living the simple life and if you ask me the government should be more concerned with these parents that are using drugs rather than living in small cabins and homeschooling their children

                 The house Dolly Partons father built was not a three walled lean-to with a tarp for a roof.

                 You insult the Partons to compare them with this family.

                 You insult the Parton Family.
                 <br/>
                 I tried to post a link to Dollys childhood home that her daddy built but it wouldnt post.
                 <br/>
                 Google it and look at the Parton family home, its nothing like this lean-to.
                 <br/>
                 Dollys father paid the doctor who delivered her with a bag of grain that he grew.
                 <br/>
                 To compare this family to the Parson family is ludicrous.

               What is wrong with not having running water. When I was a kid we had to go out to the well and get our water and had to go out to a outhouse to go to the bathroom. Nothing wrong with that. You live way in the woods. Thats not abuse. Them kids look healthy and happy. The thing is cps love taking kids away from families that are taking care of their kids and leave the ones that need to be remove there.

                 Oh what a load of bs. CPS is not in the business of removing children from decent homes while leaving others in deplorable situations/abject squalor, to say otherwise is just asinine. My guess is that youre just bitter and unable to own up to your own shortcomings and deficiencies as a parent

                   CPS is a joke in most states, just like our Govt. Not having running water isnt abuse. Not having a separate bedroom for each child isnt abuse. Perhaps you should pay attention to current events dumbass, many kids die because they were either left, or given back to abusive parents, by your amazing CPS. Maybe some peoples grammar isnt the best, but at least they have common sense, must have been a class you missed while you were studying proper English..LMAO

               Well said my ass. If you choose to have running water, then have it, if not, then dont. Not one of those children look abused.  Your ancestors didnt have running water and 10 bedroom homes either. They didnt have doctors, gave birth at home, bathed in a lake. Cause you think people should do things the way you do, makes you an ignorant ass.

               I agree! People just love to believe anything they read. If its on the internet, it must be true, people are so gullible! Anyone with any common sense has to know there is more to this story than what was reported.

               Um, who needs running water?   There are reason, numerous good ones at that,  people live off grid.   This is just another over reach by .gov.  I do agree about the article though.  Who cares if they have face book.

               Bottom line  is if they are happy, healthy and choose to live this version of off the grid lifestyle, who the hell are any of you to judge them? Kids get hurt and have accidents all the time. If not a serious or life threatening injury what does it matter? He who throws the first stone. None have all the facts so why pass judgment on anything when you know nothing? As if your bigot opinions even matte.

               Anna and your point is???  Who are you or anyone else to dictate how one should live their life?  Unfortunately, there are many of your kind who spend 50 percent or more of your time each day, browsing every page following other peoples lives on Facebook!  Your lives must be exremely unfulfilling!  Not only do you spend hours living other peoples lives YOU have to judge and share your self-serving opinions on what is an acceptable way of living to YOU in this already very controlled and conditioned society!  Get a life!
              </p>
              <p>
               Live your unfulfilling and boring life of daily being glued on FB.  Be brain washed and conditioned with all the negativity and foolishness of society on television.  Consume all the latest disposable electronics, gadgets and fashions for temporary and meaningless pleasure.  Use recycled water treated with chlorine and other chemicals that are actually more harmful and may be the cause of illnesses. Consume chemically sprayed and injected food with hormones that make you fat and sick!  Look at your belly and thighs!
              </p>
              <p>
               The Nuagler family  live a praisable life!   One has to persevere,   be resourceful, creative and courageous  in order to live their way of life.  While you I am sure and many others are unable to survive a single night because you will be taken away from what  you and your societys definition of an ideal  and standard way of life is.  Possesing all your conveniences in life and material possessions obviously does not fulfill your life.  Youre obviously more interested in the Nauglers way of living.  In a scenerio where survival is required; I am sure the Naugler family will succeed in surviving and living a comfortable life than you.
              </p>
              <p>
               This culture and society imposing its twisted, selfish and arrogant standards and beliefs on how others should live destroy people and their families. How shameful and scandalous!

               I grew up in just as small of a house, off the grid, on far fewer acres and had no running water and was home schooled for a portion of my education as well. I grew up perfectly happy and healthy as well as quite successfully as a well adjusted human and owner of several legitimate businesses. A lack of running water denotes no need to remove a child from a loving tiny off the grid home.

               Its amazing that just because someone lives differant than society that all off a sudden we think that its wrong. Honestly the 75% in this country who live in public housing an off assistance are wrong shame on those who are commenting an saying these children are being denied care and being abusesed just because these people care and correct there children its not abuse i bet yu every one of those children are scared right now and want to be home with their family

               I guess we can assume that Breckenridge Co, KY has no homeless families living on the streets that they can devote their time to. Wonder if those kids get to go to school and have running water. Right-wing mongers.

                 One thing Breckenridge county KY does have is pedophile deputies. One was recently asked to resign because he was involved in a state wide child molestation ring that spanned at least 4 counties and 3 law agencies. A KSP trooper was indicted along with a Brandenburg city cop. and other KSP involved in the cover up  have been fired. Virtually all the local media has only aired clips that have been censored by KSP propaganda folks. Damage control was immediate with a gag order on all involved to silence this disgusting cover up. check out KSP Jerry Clanton on UTUBE at his job dismissal hearing. Hopefully KSP have not ordered that removed. The UTUBE shows the trooper trying to get his job back because the 15 year old girl he molested in his patrol car lied and said she was 18 and that she seduced him. This is scary as hell none of these cops are being held accountable. Hopefully the pedophile Breckenridge deputy was not involved in picking up this poor families little girls. All these local moral hypocrites turned a blind eye to the child rape scandal involving police yet scream, with mob mentality about child abuse because of living off grid.

             I dont know the full story here, and obviously there MIGHT be more to it, but I HAVE seen the system abuse parental rights and also ignore true abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             One neighbor of mine used to lock her 4-year-old son outside for 8 hours at a time while she entertained her friends with dope, alcohol and sex. The little boy used to come to my kitchen window for peanut butter sandwiches or band-aids. Sometimes he even watched his younger brother outside for hours at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
             When another neighbor finally had enough of it and reported her, I happened to be nearby with one of my kids. I watched as the authorities marched through her house, looked straight at the dope and drug paraphernalia (sitting on her coffee table in FULL view from her front window and obviously well-used), and went on their merry way writing case closed on her file as they left. She never lost her kids to the system no matter what she did and we always wondered who she had pictures of and what they were doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, I did nearly lose my kids because I refused to vaccinate them after the oldest one nearly died within MINUTES of getting his first shots. Even the doctor  who was big on vaccinations  had told me our son had a severe vaccine reaction and should get no more shots under any circumstances. He also said I should not vaccinate any others due to increased risk in our family, but I didnt get that in writing.
            </p>
            <p>
             So when a know-it-all LPN decided to report ME our family was investigated. Our current family doctor had to sign off that our kids were well, healthy, and had proper care or I might have a different version of this story.
            </p>
            <p>
             The absolute power of CPS today is most certainly a violation of ALL our liberty. In most states they can and do remove children without proper warrants and with next to no recourse by the parents, who are NOT given the right to defend themselves in any proper, legal way.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my experience, child protective services rarely actually DO their job of protecting children. It is easier and more profitable by far to harass those who are easy targets and have children suitable for adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it HAS TO STOP!

               The same statists who perpetuate such govt tyranny have absolutely no problem with aborting a late term baby in the womb or even after that, if the abortionist screws up and doesnt kill the baby in the womb.

                 Uh huh. Just as the pro life crowd that incessantly argues for the sanctity of all life all too often supports punitive legislation that disproportionately affects children/elderly/disabled in an adverse manner. Not to mention their overwhelming support of capital punishment which has been proven time and time again to be a failure and riddled with institutional bias.

               I think youre making that story up.  No way cops would miss the chance to do a drug bust.   I think youre just mad because they had a  valid case against you, and the other lady was smart enough to put her drugs away, or maybe didnt even have any drugs in the house.

               DCF in FL is a joke! My ex daughter in laws boyfriend was selling pot to my 14 yr old grandson and his friends. She bought him a $120 bong, I called the police and I was there when they confiscated the bong and my grandson filled out a police report. DCF came, saw the pictures of her bfs hands holding a large amount of pot AND the text messages that clearly stated Steve (her bf) got the pot for them. They did NOTHING! The liberal investigator said she cant be for sure its the same Steve! My grandson told her it was! I was blown away. My 10 yr old grandaughter told the investigator that Steve sleeps next to her on the trundle bed in her room and it upsets her, investigator did NOTHING! Mother, her bf Steve, my grandson and grandaughter all sleep in the SAME bedroom!

               They are raising their 10 children in a 3 walled shack surrounded by piles of garbage.  There is no septic system and no running water.  The government has reason to be concerned.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look them up.  The sherriffs report is online along with pictures of their shack.

                 Angela, So what? Are the children dying of disease? Are they malnourished? Are they emotionally healthy? Are they loved? By all accounts they were happy, healthy children. Take a child from their parents and they are scarred for life.

                 The govt has NO right to intrude in their lives! Wth is nextwe cant take our kids camping unless we have a septic tank and running water?! Govt needs to hire better trained CPS workers that know how to help the kids who really need it.

                 They have a Pond on the Property if need be they can use this water. They bring water in many people do. They use a Composting Toilet so they do not waste water. Composting Human Waste takes 1 year before you can use it in your garden. Their Cabin has  4 Walls in the warmer weather they have the one wall open which leads to the out door kitchen. In the winter the wall is closed up and they have a Wood stove for heat. They recycle almost everything. There was no broken glass every where. They keep the out door kitchen cleaner then some keep their modern homes clean. They decided to live this way as a Family. It takes time and money to build a larger home. They have a Pet Grooming Business that a friend invested in which is the familys income. They have Goats that give them their Milk and they also make cheese from the Goats Milk. They have Chickens that give them Eggs. They Hunt and Fish.  The children all participate in doing chores, even cooking and they are taught reading, writing and math in a different way and to each childs own level. They also learn a lot more the way they are living then in any school or homeschool program. Many people are against the way they live and are making up lies. The son Alex that was taken away was not Nicoles son it was Joes and there was never any proof that Joe did anything wrong. In fact Nicole what a Blog about Alex a few years ago and what had happened. They have nothing to hide. Before the children were taken away they have had both a Blog and Facebook and posted all the time of their Good times and Hard times. They get through things together as a Family. They never Beg or Steal or live off the Government. Yes they accept Donations but that is a lot different as People have the choice to Donate or not to Donate. Another thing just because they live off the Grid does not mean they can not have a Cell phone and Internet Service. Many Homesteaders and Tiny House people live Off the Grid and still have the Internet, Computers, Cell Phones. Many work from their home and need a Computer to do their Business. I have a Cell Phone that costs 35.00 a month for unlimited calls&amp; texts and a certain amount of Internet. This family does not waste money, they live a very Frugal lifestyle. They are not in debt for material things. They are teaching their children how to Respect and Live off the land. They Respect the Animals and everything in life. I do not care how many people do not like how they live their life. This is a Loving Hard Working Family. There are many Children out there who are being Physically and Sexually and Verbally Abused everyday. These abused children are living in the Modern Homes with all of the Amenities yet no one is Helping them. Those are the Children that NEED HELP. Not the 10 Children who are living just fine with all their needs met. Nicole has said many of times if the Children or herself needed Medical care they would get it. So many People think that because your Pregnant that it means you are Sick and needing a Doctor. She has Friends that are Doctors and Midwives and if ever she needed treatment while Pregnant she would get it. But she knows her Body and after having many Pregnancies she does not need to run to the Dr every month and have Ultrasounds done. She has given Birth to 10 Healthy Babies. She is also capable if her child get hurt to determine of she could heal them or they need more serious medical treatment. I was raised on a Farm and I was barefooted all the time. Your feet become stronger. So what if her kids run around on their own Property bare footed. They are in no danger and not breaking any law. They all know how to clean up before bed and how to dress nice when they go out and about. But when they are home doing chores and actively playing the Dirt will not hurt them. Dirt is good for you and helps build up your immune system. Also the children do know the difference of Dirt and Animal Feces. They have safeguard the Cabin and Out Door Kitchen so that the Goats can not get in and make a mess or Eat their Food. A Lesson that they learned. One of the boys came up with the stick fence that he built around the Cabin and Out Door Kitchen. One of the boys made a High Chair for the Baby out of a Old Plastic Chair and a Bench. That is what is called using your Imagination and learning how to Upcycle and the Baby loved it also it encourages young minds to always create. It will be Proven that there was no Abuse and that the Children were all Safe, Healthy and Happy the way they were living.

             Well having a face book will ultimately lead you somewhere down the line in the sight of the feds anyway since it IS being up and run COVERTLY by the NSAsses.. i encourage ALL of Humanity to INDULGE in this lifestyle  but as community and UNIFICATION. Through NETWORKING &amp; COMMUINICATION such as using the INTERNET (unregulated by tyrannical tendencies of passive supressive censorship,) through such a dire transition to really get to understand our TRUE selves not the self that has been TOLD by societies standards k will ultimately lead you somewhere down the line in the sight of the feds anyway since it IS being up and run COVERTLY by the NSA**es.. i encourage ALL of Humanity to INDULGE in this lifestyle  but as community and UNIFICATION. Through NETWORKING &amp; COMMUNiCATION such as using the INTERNET (unregulated by tyrannical tendencies of passive- supressive censorship,) through such a dire transition to really get to understand our TRUE selves not the self that has been TOLD by Societies standards -no that is mind Conditioning of delusion to a higher degree, no the INNER Self from the mind and Heart where the Awesome Originates! (its involuntary for a reason)
             <br/>
             Think about that for a second and it will come around to the same conclusion when you compare and contrast with meditating in a forest or an open field on a sunny clear day. SIGNIFICANT difference that off grid living is FAR More beneficial to our Mind Body and yes the SOUL.

               The state wastes millions in welfare giving it to people who do not deserve it. There is no good reason why the State who has an obligation to our families to protect our rights to our life styles, can not provide the  needs which you claim is the real reason this family was injustly ripped apar

             Well having a facebook will ultimately lead you somewhere down the line in the sight of the feds anyway since it IS being up and run COVERTLY by the NSA**es.. i encourage ALL of Humanity to INDULGE in this lifestyle  but as community and UNIFICATION. Through NETWORKING &amp; COMMUNiCATION such as using the INTERNET (unregulated by tyrannical tendencies of passive- supressive censorship,) through such a dire transition to really get to understand our TRUE selves not the self that has been TOLD by Societies standards -no that is mind Conditioning of delusion to a higher degree, no the INNER Self from the mind and Heart where the Awesome Originates! (its involuntary for a reason)
             <br/>
             Think about that for a second and it will come around to the same conclusion when you compare and contrast with meditating in a forest or an open field on a sunny clear day. SIGNIFICANT difference that off grid living is FAR More beneficial to our Mind Body and yes the SOUL.

               Stacey, HSDLA is getting involved? Great. We cant leave it there though. We the people must also get involved. Support this family and others  in that State by overwhelming the State and County with all types of correspondence. Remove the commissioners of the agencies involved, i.e., sherrifs office police, cps, foster care, county execs, etc. Any and all persons involved in this mass kidnapping and hostage taking must be removed from their official positions and brought up on criminal charges. Seriously friends, We do have an obligation to stand with this family and each other against our severely corrupt government.

               Do you know that for a fact, Stacey? HSLDA will only get involved if the families problems are solely because of homeschooling. And I am quite sure they will only get involved if the family is a member of HSLDA. I dont know if this family is, but it appears unlikely.

             From the facts presented I cannot understand why the children were apprehended. I was raised on a farm and had ten siblings. We hauled out water from a large dugout, took baths in a metal tub. All of us have university degrees and two were trained and work at trades. These children would be the least likely to be accused of the columbine kid mentality, those kids who had money yet who were allowed to be raised by the Internet and video-game world. Since when does teaching children integrity and self responsibility hinge on having running water.

               The reason for that is that the real facts are NOT being presented in this article.
               <br/>
               The cops showed up because the father (who has a LONG criminal history and at least 4 prior arrests) stole water from a neighbors well, threatened this same neighbor with a gun, and even called the neighbor a c*** on her own property.
               <br/>
               This isnt hearsay, this I read on the families own Facebook page.
               <br/>
               This family is after money, and are using this to raise tens of thousands off people who dont even go look at the families own Facebook page.

             These people are the worst kind imaginable. Know them wellI just sit and laugh at how they have scammed ALL of you! They are the biggest con-artists out there. They do nothing but prey off of good people, many who have just helped donate to their scam. They are NOT un-schoolers, home-schoolers or homesteaders! They actually give home-schooling families and people who live off the grid a horrible name. Theyre kids are treated like slaves and it is sick! They claim to be Christian, yet have been kicked out of numerous churches because they break the law, lie, cheat, manipulate, and steal anyway they can. You dont have to believe me, but it is the truth! They have stolen thousands of dollars from churches in the area. Joe bullies local Bishops, preachers, and any and all clergy-by stating he will use force on them if money isnt donated to him to pay his bills. He has also threatened good christian people and their children! YES! Their childrenThis is the kind of sick individual you all are donating money too.  He has been arrested numerous times and has been reported to CPS numerous times by hard-working concerned citizens, not a meth using facebook user as they would like you to believe. The children appear brain-washed and abused and have absolutely no social skills what so ever. You can contradict me all you wish, but we have experienced this family first-hand. I also know people who have been in the home and what you would experience upon entering is sickening!  It was stated that there was human feces everywhere! The children looked as if they hadnt been bathed in months with feces all over them. No water or beds for them to sleep in. She will post a picture on fb of a bed and spin it a thousand different ways to make you think the children have beds. She grooms dogs because he will not work! When you have ten kidsyou work to support your family! I dont care what or where you livea condo or in the wilderness! They manipulate social media to their advantage and I listened to that audio and that Sheriff was doing his JOB!!! She resisted arrest and put on a big show for everyone! THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME. They go into a grocery store and steal and pretend to fall, just so they can get money from the owners.  They are hypocrites who judge everyone else in society who doesnt live the way they do. They also posted something once that all the men and women who fight for this country, deserve to diethese are two sick and twisted individuals. This time they went too far. The best thing that could ever happen is their children are taken away. It is my sincere hope they are not returned. I pray for that Sheriffs Dept, that they will be able to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. This is the truth and I could care less who replies and donates to them. They will squander all your money away and be back in the very same position months from now.

               Such a long rant posted anonymously suggests you have a personal axe to grind  who knows, maybe you were the one to call it in? not that I care, the family sounds like theyve gone full retard anyway.

                 I have no ax to grind and regret NOT reporting them. I dont care either. I just think they have scammed so many peoplethats what they are good at. They have mastered it. Its sickening but I know that they will get whats coming to them sooner or later, or maybe even now. Those children deserve good homes with loving families. You cant help sick people like The Nauglersthey will worm their way into a situation and manipulate it a thousand different ways. I hope they take their donation that they scammed off all you good people and get the hell out of Kentucky!!!!!!!!!!

                   Your remarks, if true, remind me a lot of the family in a book I read last year, Pilgrims Wilderness by Tom Kizzia.  On the outside that family looked wholesome and wonderful in every way.  I pray for the safety of the children in this family.

                   Will someone pass this information on to the Kentucky family. I also hope they can sue that smart ass person who admitted they informed on them. Now that would be justice,Reaping as the witch sowed.

                   she appears to be gloating.   Even if s/he takes her post down it is cached.

                   I would say her unsubstaniated accusations can be used against her/him. Sounds like a catty woman.

                   There is No justification for the Govt to take the children in this situation as these people will inform them.

                   I hope the link makes a contact, I had just found the video.  I do know though that these people are extremely knowledgable &amp; have been working separately from this new movement for many years.

                 Oh whatever. Who cares if he posted as anonymous? Its kinda hypocritical of you to call him out as you have simply gone by the rather generic name of Mark as if that isnt anonymous for all intent and purpose. By your logic, nothing you post should be taken at face value and in fact should be regarded as suspect.

                 Sources? Heck, you can see she is telling the truth by looking at the familys own public Facebook page. No stove, no outhouse, poop Literaly EVERYWHERE, very small shack with only 3 walls and no insulation, its the worst living conditions I have ever seen, and I grew up in Alaska, homeschooled 12 years, off grid.

                 THEY are the source dumbass. I agree parents should have primary decision making but not all parents that supposedly homeschool &amp; live off the grid are capable of it. I was homeschooled and it definitely was not a walk in the park. It was a very abusive and negligent experience all because my parents were convinced they new better. And believe me I was NOT a happy child. So in the advent of all those supporting homeschooling and living off the grid, DO NOT be blind to the fact their are some people that do claim to be homeschooling and claim their children are happy because the reality is they arent.

               And of course you have proof of all this. Why did the Friday CPS inspection not reveal any of this?  How were they able to clean up stunted, diseased, scrawny kids for beautiful Facebook pictures? Where did they get electricity, Internet connections and a warm dry place to use their computer?
              </p>
              <p>
               What the hell is motivating you anyway?

                 There is absolutely NO evidence, of any kind, that CPS found no problems at the homestead.only the word of the parents.
                 <br/>
                 The photos posted on this families own Facebook show some of the most dangerous, filthy and down right sickening living conditions I have ever seen.
                 <br/>
                 The way this famy was living with 10 kids makes some of the refugee camps Ive visited look like the Ritz.
                 <br/>
                 This is being presented as an off the grid issue, or a home school issue, it isnt.
                 <br/>
                 Its a basic health and safety issue in regards to 10 children living in what amounts to an open air chicken coop, bare foot and covered in filth.

               This world is now in the hands of self serving people who have been given power by us who do not get involved. We are way too busy trying to make a living. Power left unchecked leads to corruption. Our chdren are used as commodities in foster care,  the schools system, as well as divorce court for child support, etc these agencies all receive big crazy federal dollars just to exist. And, theres NO accounting for how the money is Used. Ex: for every dollar that a non custodial parent pays a custodial parent, the state receives 0.66 cents. For every dollar NOT paid by a non custodial parent, the State receives 2.00. Claiming the money is ised to find the deadbeat. search for the deadbeat is only a letter to the last known address. Arrests happen and additional fed dollars are given for everone placed in jail. This is a HUGE industry. This is why men are forced to pay support for kids who are not theirs. It gets them into this system

               So, are you a close neighbor who sees all of his or perhaps a family member? Do you have any pictures of the issues you described? It would be helpful if you explained.

               actually i know them too. she used to work for me for a short time. and what she is saying is the truth. the kids smelled like pee, joe got fired from his job at the hotel for multiple reasons including theft. while she was working for me her son got his hand burned pretty badly and never received any medical attention she just took care of it at home their children do not have social security cards, or birth certificates or vaccinations or medical check ups. when i asked her what was going to happen when they turned 18 she said they can do what they want.. and i said how.. they dont even have birth certificates. the love to record and over react any time a cop pulls them over so they can share it all over facebook to prove they are being harassed.. joe burrowed money from my daughter to buy drugs then refused to pay her back and threatened her. these people are scum and they treat their kids like shit. and im putting my name in here and i hope they read it.

                 Patricia, you write as though having Socialist Slave cards and birth certificates is a necessary part of growing up, and you do not allow for reasonable people to hold any other opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many people are opposed to the abuse of the SS system, which was originally voluntary and only focused on retirement based on ones own earnings.  The SS system has become so much more, including a way to track and control SS cardholders every action.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Great if you like that sort of thing, but to force it on others is a right which neither you nor the government to which you delegate your power has the right to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know some attentive, doting and loving families in which the children are well cared for, and in which no child has a SS card, birth certificate (because of the enumeration-at-birth program to force SSNs on newborns) and no vaccinations (because of family history of adverse reactions).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just take a step back and check your prejudices at the door.  Its only a free country if one has the ability to act as he or she wishes so long as no harm is done to others.  These children are nor being harmed, or at least I see no evidence thereof.  Dirty children are in their natural state; glowingly clean children living in a sterile home are being set up for a lifetime of allergies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let the criminal justice system do what it ought in the case of any chargeable offenses either parent may have committed, but let the children remain with their parents until (if it happens that) the parents are sentenced under due process with all appeals.  Taking all the children away based on unpleasant interactions with neighbors and perhaps bad manners is tyranny, plain and simple.  Let the parents remain parents as they enjoy full due process of law, if in fact any laws may have been broken.

             I think that the government is getting WAY out of hand. I think that in a normal innocent situation, the thing to do is to say NO. If no is not an acceptable answer, then MAKE A STAND !
            </p>
            <p>
             You should say no, then say no, again. Then the next thing to do is to have a stand off while you are contacting the media AND ESPECIALLY several militias. Check out the story of Clive Bundy out of Nevada. There was over 1,000 protestors gathered at his ranch and supposedly armed militia members present AND rumor has it that militia from several states were on their way.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were prepared to take a stand and armies of militia were ready, willing, and able (and maybe even anxious) to fight and POSSIBLY start the next American Revolution. If they are willing to do that for 1,000s of head of cattle, hehehe, what do you think would happen if the militia (s) were notified about the kidnapping of 10 children by a crooked law enforcement? And would THAT county sheriff and deputies want to be solely and personally responsible for having several ARMIES of militia that would be one heck of a match for the states National Guard, to come in and lay siege to the town?
            </p>
            <p>
             The government freaked bad when the militia started to show up in Nevada and backed off. Clive Bundy won  period. I would think that the whole county government would be terrified if militia were to pour in with snipers, heavy weapons, rocket launchers and enough men to make the National Guard think twice. Get the militias involved.

               One: its not kidnapping. Two: Cliven Bundy was in the wrong and in full violation of both federal and state law; all of his supporters were littl more than rabble rousing ignoramuses. And had those clowns decided to open fire on federal agents all in defense of Bundys illegal actions then they would have been massacred where the stood. No new revolution, just a dire need for new body bags

               How amusing that these far right militias were so gung-ho on fighting on behalf of a lazy, self-indulgent welfare rancher and perennial mooch. Not to mention the whole being an ignorant tool whose actions flew in the face of the very constitution he ostensibly supported (Nevadas)

               Sure if by win you mean the government backed down from an escalating situation in which armed protesters not only threatened violence but had even intimated that they would use women/children as human shields. And the government, not wanting to risk loss of life all because of some ignorant instigators attempting to protect a law breaking moocher, all the while the fines remain in place. Then sure, you won. You won a singular round by threatening to harm those doing their jobs and sworn to uphold the law. So congrats on your line victory in more than two decades. I suppose you lunatics were bound to get one after all this time.

             First off Im an educated Foster mom who also works full time. If this is the worst theyve done and everyone is happy and healthy and self supporting .leave them be. Being taken from bio families that are good is terribly traumatic. I would think they should be concentrating on meth labs etc where children are being exposed

               You dont have all the facts.
               <br/>
               The father is a bully and carrier criminal with a long rap sheet (doubt me? Look him up).
               <br/>
               The article is straight up lying.
               <br/>
               The dont have a cabin they have. 300 square foot shack with only 3 sides , built out of old palest and rotten two by fours.
               <br/>
               The dont even have an outhouse, a wood stove or a well.
               <br/>
               The children are filthy and covered in grime, sleeping in a big pile with up to 7 dogs on a wooden floor and a wooden bench.
               <br/>
               Im not lying, I got all that info from photos and posts on this families own Facebook page.
               <br/>
               Go look for yourself.

             From my knowledge, authorities do not remove children unless they absolutely have too, because then the burden falls on someone else to look after them.
             <br/>
             I personally cannot agree with their way of life, and it is not how I would choose to live mine.
             <br/>
             Without knowing full circumstances it is hard to pass an opinion, except to say that ANY cabin would be crowded with that size family in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I suspect authorities felt the children were compromised with their health, in one way or another and decided to remove them for that reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             Having facebook access and yet not using protection when it comes to sex, seems quite illogical to me.
             <br/>
             I have trouble believing people are genuine about alternative lifestyles when they compromise on certain issues and remain inconsistent throughout.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, regardless of public outcry the matter is now in the authorities hands. Hopefully they will investigate decently and fairly and make the correct decision for the sake of the children.

               They removed these children on a tip, ANYONE CAN CALL IN A COMPLAINT  A MAD NEIGHBOR, AN EX, EMPLOYER, DCBS EMPLOYEE. AND THEY WILL DO AN INVESTIGATION. SO AS FAR AS YOU SAYING SOMETHING HAS TO BE WRONG FOR SOCIAL SERVICES TO GET INVOLVED,YOU ARE WRONG BECAUSE ANYONE CAN CALL IN A TIP.

                 but in the mean time, they get stuck in the small town court system; a system that feeds off of innocent people in order to support the people who are working in the system. Sorry, but I have no faith in this cruel and unjust judicial system.

               We have families of 8 to 10 living in homes that small in cities. YES!!! i bet sometimes their water gets turned off as well. but at least this family probably had a spring to draw from. people in the city end up buying water that is outragiously priced. I think this movement is threateningto many who have lived with so many convienences they do not think it normal to want to live more closely with nature. I mean why, right. Lets just keep driving gas guzlers and tearing up mountains and fracking for gas that is helping to cause all the earthquakes in the west. What happens when the water runs out? you will be running to these people to survive. And I bet your going to be so scared your going to steal from them. just saying. you make your choices, they made theirs. if the kids are happy then let them be.

             Tthis clearly indicates the need for media literacy. People see something on the Internet, so they assume its the gospel truth. This is not a credible piece of journalism. Its full of opinion, and is not objective in the least. It reminds me of Kony 2012.
             <br/>
             Im a big hippie, and Im all for living off grid, u schooling, homeschooling, and growing your own food. And, I have had personal experiences with CPS that prove they can get it all wrong and even wreck lives.
             <br/>
             But something here stinks, and this is not a credible news story.
             <br/>
             I find it interesting, but There are a lot more credible places to give money, and in the light of other problems we face, this pales.
             <br/>
             Just because you read it on Facebook doesnt make it true.

             It is illegal to use a legal name  fraud. Stop claiming to be/use/identify as the legal name.  Its a crime.  This is why these things happen.

             This story really infuriates me.  The police in this county really need to get off their high horse and go out and stop all the people who are doing things such as stealing, drugs , and even murder ( yes I said murder).  Oh no, those type of people just get a slap on the wrist and in one case she received a large sum of money and told to move out of the county.  If it is illegal to not have running water, I should have been arrested years ago.  While I was growing up, we had no running water but we got our water from a spring.  The way I see it, this family has done nothing wrong and I see no reason to force them to become corrupt and evil like most other people.  Leave them alone and let them live the way God intended.

             Everyone has been asking what the true story is. I do not know what it is but here is a different and more reasonable version, especially when you see the video and images of the house.

             Im not sure if some of you read other articles than this, or have poor reading skills. CPS did not remove the children- the article says the Sheriffs Dept did. There is a difference and explains why there was no CPS visitation beforehand.   From other comments, the living conditions sound questionable and I doubt their version of schooling is not the issue.  It should be. Letting your kids decide the curriculum and teaching what they are interested or fascinated in makes for an incomplete education. Parents have to teach things the kids need, even if they dont like it. Saying they are teaching the way it was done before public education.. there were a lot of illiterate, un-and-undereducated people back then, werent there? And remember- intelligent and  educated are not synonymous.

               Miriam, I agree with several things you said. The article did say the Sheriffs Dept removed the children, and CPS was only involved, not the ones who took the children away. However, I was homeschooled until third grade, and I can say it was the best, most fun, happiest time of my life. I think what the article meant by allowing the child to decide the curriculum, was merely what subjects they would progress more rapidly through, and how rapidly they struggle through others.
              </p>
              <p>
               Every person (children are people, just younger versions; I feel like many adults forget that fact) has a gift, and with that gift, there will ALWAYS be a weakness. Normal school can (and may) cause a child to fail to excel, partly because normal school does not consider the fact that some childrens weaknesses are like a lock, and that lock has to be carefully opened for the gift to emerge and blossom, otherwise the gift will be damaged, or unable to emerge. I see many students failing school because their weakness has become a lock, and the school system has tried to force that lock open, rather than gently unlocking it, thus damaging the gift within. Children are delicate, and easy to mold, but also easy to break.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, sometimes homeschooling can cause a child to not excel (or fall behind) in a certain subject because the child is not pushed to excel, or because they are not properly shown how to excel in that subject. I am naturally gifted toward creativity (for me, it is writing and art). Most of you have probably heard the phrase in one ear, out the other. My weakness was that information would go in one ear, and either get lost in the recesses of my brain, or take a while to process. If I had stayed in homeschooling, my parents would have likely noticed this later than they did, but would have sent me to help, nonetheless, as they did for my brother. Instead, I went to public school, they realized I was having problems much sooner, and got help for me very quickly.

               The character of the parents in the situation, the health of the children, and the state of the home are questionable aspects of the situation. This article (which I do not doubt is biased to some degree) states that the parents were good people; the children were happy, healthy, and well taken care of; and the living conditions were healthy and spacious (the land, not the cabin). However, other people (who I certainly believe are to an extent biased as they have not provided any proof whatsoever) have posted that the parents are thieves, bullies, and leeches; the children are gaunt, diseased, and covered in their own scat all the time; and the home is a shack made of poles and tarps, and the land is in a terrifying state.
              </p>
              <p>
               Who are we to believe, if there is only vague proof? So, people, if you are posting about this in relation to the familys situation based on something other than this article, please provide proof. If you have pictures, post them, or provide a link to them. If you are going off of what a different article is telling you, please, post the link. All I have (and what many other people reading this have) is the word of the human population, and I, for one, know for a fact that people tend to twist and stretch the truth.

             Looks are deceiving they were living in a three walled shack with no running water garbage and nails all over the property and non of the provisions that you would need to provide for children and they also failed to provide birth certificates to the home school according to the article a I have read. They also state that these people are good at scamming people onto thinking they did nothing wrong so they can receive money from people who feel bad for them Im not sure what the full story is but the picture proof is on her facebook. Theyre is also and article on tumbler about 7 things they they have neglected to tell us that include a copy of the report from cops along with Facebook posts and pictures from what I have seen and read the children are safer in foster homes.

             I have known many missionary kids that are adults now.   They were raised in areas known for disease because of the living conditions and no running water.   These people are more grounded and educated than the majority of the other people I know or have met.   Majority of these people are very successful.   Many run multinational corporations and charities.   To say these conditions are not meant to support a stable family is ridiculous and only shows your understanding of the true family unit as God intended.

             From there facebook page it looked like they had spring water on the property.
             <br/>
             It seems if there was no abuse involved the kids should not of been removed
             <br/>
             and they should of had there day in court this all seems wrong to me.

             O but when I report drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse in front of my children while with their mother and step dad DCS does nothing. They send a letter, knocks on the door several times apperantly , then 6 months later says they are closing the case because they cant get a response from the household to investigate.Finally both her and her husband arrested for domestic violence and she was arrested twice in one night for a aggravated domestic assault then after bonding out showed back up at their house hitting him with a baseball bat and stabbed him with a steak knife and put her husband  in the hospital Bacause he called the cops and had her arrested the first time.  After all that I still have had to spend almost $10,000 to get custody of my 2 daughters . I guess none of that matters as long as they have running water and go to public school.

             Obviously there is a lot that is left out of this article. CPS was already involved as police cannot remove children without a CPS worker being present. Dont judge too fast.. We are getting a very small amount of information in this case. Kids are always going to be happier with their biological parents, even if they live in disgusting situations. BC its what they know. Id like to know the WHOLE story why these kids were removed. We are NOT getting the whole story here.

             I just want to say that the government is a joke and if you guys are that low to do this to a family who has done nothing wrong. Then you all are really not using your brain. Your going to do this to these people when most kids now days dont even finish school. You guys are so smart Maybe you should be more concerned about other matters than how these people decided to raise there kids and how they decide school there kids. Im sure they are doing a better job than any of the people who arrested them. Our law enforcement and our government is a joke they stand up for the wrong things and punish people who are doing the right things.

             Why dont they go after the parents who really abuse their children? These people sound like very loving and caring parents! I homeschooled my son and we all have different ways of doing it. I think this is a action of one so called friend, which they would no longer be a friend! They need to return these kids to the parents, they are harming these kids more than the parents by taking them away for no reason!!
             <br/>
             I heard of another family this had happened to as well and they also had 10 kids and home schooled the kids. They just got the kids back after 3-4 months of fighting for them.

             This is absolutely maddening. Those children were probably getting a better education then most. Learning about life, and obtaining life skills, instead of the only skill most kids have these days wich is the skill of acting entitled. Because one neighbor didnt agree with there way of life is asinine. Hope that person is proud of them self for tearing the family apart and most likely putting the children in situation that is less then  and exposing them to potential abuse. And as for the law did they honestly follow the policies/ procedures that were set in place for a reason? What is this work coming to. Now this family has to fight and jump through many hoops that are on fire to get the family back together. Because someone didnt agree with their humble way of life.

             As frustrating as this experience is for them and all who are witnessing it; realize all the eyes that are being opened. How many conversations have resulted from this? How many Sheeple awakened from their accepted slumber? This family is a strong, courageous catalyst for Truth to transform our current accepted reality.

             I am so grateful for all this is opening and creating for All; and pray for a swift and easy reunion for every member of this family. Imagine what the foster families are learning!!

             I pray the family gets back together. This is total harassment and dictorship. Shame on those that are hurting this family. My heart and prayers go out to this family.

             At first I was so upset for this family, but the more I looked into it I dont think they are as innocent as they seem.  The conditions this family is living in is disgusting. Im ok with no running water, an outhouse, no electricity, but there so called cabin is a 3 walled tiny shack, in all the pictures there is debree everywhere, and the children are always running around barefoot, thats just dangerous, you dont have to be rich to pick up garbage!  We want to think they are just living the old fashioned life, but the first thing tge settlers woul do is build a house, what this family is living in is nothing close.
             <br/>
             The allegations were (and the sherrif states this on the audio,) that the husband was on someone elses property trying to get water when confronted he told his son to get the gun, as the owner to the property this would sound like a threat to me.  A post that was removed shortly after being posted on their own facebook page stated that he didnt threaten the woman, but called her a derogatory name.  Which means to me that firstly this did happen, and secondly that it was a lie that they thought it was someone who he had defriended on facebook that made the complaint.
             <br/>
             There own spoesman said the family was kickedo of the mormon church, which gives credit to the people Ive seen posting about knowing the family, one farther down this page for instance.
             <br/>
             Its so easy to paint a pretty picture, showing the good times only, but we do not know whats really going on behind closed doors.  They arent registered as homeschoolers, they dont have birth certficates for there children (all this is from there own posts!)
             <br/>
             Im all for going back to the roots, our family is working towards our goal to get off grid, become self sufficient, we would happily live in a small cabin.  I homeschool, and dont plan to prevent children (im pregnant with our fifth)  so its not there lifestyle I have a problem with, its the way they are doing it, I would never allow my children to live that way, it is so sad!
             <br/>
             That said the state handld it all wrong, and should never get away with it .  They searched the property without a warrent wouldnt allow the family representation, and took the children without a proper investigation, all of which is illegal.

             This is part of the coming NWO.

             Anyone who doesnt poison their kids, brain wash them, mutilate them, manipulate their bodies, alter their chemistry, and ultimately make a second race/mutated Satanic demon child, will be removed from gene pool, forever.

             While i feel this article is fantastic in nature the facts remain. No running water instant reason for separation. Without running water, some sanitary toilet system, clean food hone is unsafe. Especially with history this may be what is best for this family. Farm life is great neglect is not. Based on pictures not words i see hobo shack is heat and water are present this is livable unfortunately. Granted we all prefer better doesnt mean its a reality though. While i will not be donated due to pictures i think more real facts are needed.

             This is making me angry. CPS does not have the time or resources to investigate every report and are deemed inappropriate if it does not rise to a certain level.  CPS cannot remove children without a signed court order from a judge, even in an emergency situation. I have had to track down a judge after hours and sit at his dining room table as he reads and then signs the petition, that gives CPS legal custody. If there is not compelling evidence, the judge will not sign it. If custody is granted CPS tries to place with family members first. At this time the parents are each appointed their own attorney at the states expense. After the initial appearance, if they can show they cant afford to pay for thier own attorney then the State continues to foot the bill for the duration of the case. The case goes before the judge within 10 days for a hearing where CPS has to prove its case. At this time the children can be returned if there is not enough evidence to support the allegations. is it a perfect system? No. But CPS still cant do anything without legal authority to do so. And parents DO NOT pay any legal expences if they cant afford to. There is a lot more to this story that is not being shared.

             this is dictatorship,  taking children away from loving family is bound to traumatize each of them .. I really dont think its any one in Governments business how we want to educate our children as long as they are being educated.

             OMG  this country is sick people thrive on DRAMA, give the kids back to their parents and go find abused children to help. ffs, get a grip harassment people!  If the conditons at the home are not great, give them a chance to fix the problem and come back, inspect and then leave them alone. Thier having smores by the campfire and the rest of the family vouches for them. We already know our government sucks, just leave families like this alone.

             Without knowing all the facts its impossible to judge either the family or the authorities. Every case is unique and complicated. Rarely do situations like this hinge on one, simple issue. Lots of people home school and are not harassed. I home schooled and found the local community to be supportive and nonjudgmental. My bet is, in this fanilys home, there are issues deemed to be a danger to the children. Children are particularly powerless in our society and I for one am glad to know there are officials who will step in to correct problems that injure children.

             It is curious to me why CPS isnt as interested in kids who go to public schools and leave in slums with deplorable conditions White Christian Children living in rural areas much just be more important to them! (And yes the last part is sarcasm!).

               Im not sure what point youre trying to make?  White Christian Children dont live in slums?  Or CPS isnt interested in kids who go to public school?  Im a foster parent and in the 15 kids weve had, all of them have gone to public school.  And ten of them have been white Christian children from very poor areas (which you might classify as slums).

             PLEASE DONT DONATE JUST YET
            </p>
            <p>
             I wont comment on whether the kids were rightfully removed from the parents or not as I feel we dont have the full story yet.  Obviously, this article is biased.  Furthermore, CPS is not able to comment on details of an active case.  I imagine it will be a while before enough is revealed to know the truth.  Please remember all the cases where the public jumped on the bandwagon only to be blindsided later when more details were revealed (Duke lacrosse case?).
            </p>
            <p>
             What I do want to comment on is the fundraising effort.  In looking at their fundraising page, it seems most people are donating to either assist with legal costs or to help improve their homestead.  Id just like to warn people to really think about that before donating because:
            </p>
            <p>
             1.  Everyone has a right to legal representation, regardless of your income.  They do not need money to get a lawyer.  Furthermore, legal activist groups are already stepping forward offering to help, making it quite likely theyll have strong legal representation.
            </p>
            <p>
             2.   Why do you feel their homestead needs to be improved?  These two people decided to live their lives in a certain way with all that entailed, including a shack for a house, no electricity, and no running water.  That must mean they are content with the conditions.  If they are not content, then they are two able-bodied adults who are very capable of getting a job and raising money to make any improvements they would like.  Since they have chosen to live off the land, rather than get a traditional job, we must assume they are content.  Who are we to give them money to improve what they are happy with? Unless theyre not happy and, for whatever reason, opt against a job and instead take generous donations from kind-hearted folks.
            </p>
            <p>
             That would mean this is a scam.  Id like to think better of people, but something doesnt smell right here.  Based on that, I will hold off on any donations until more facts are released.  I urge others to do the same.

             The criminalization of consciously parenting our children has got to stop! What our society deems appropriate is so far off from what is actually supportive of the development of the child. I hope this family is soon reunited.

             by the way no one takes children away from the Mormons or Amish etc. people have rights and there are children all over the world home schooled every day/ Actors and actors kids/or kids of those who always have to travel due to there jobs etc. It is terrorization or harassment and infringement on others right just because they choose to live differently then you. That is not a crime. I have traveled the world and have seen much and I so hesitate to judge others and know to seek out knowledge and understanding and in all my getting get understanding. they should leave this family alone. so what. who are they to come in and decide how they live. It is also proven that home-schooled children are better educated and better equipped to handle life and college and anything than those schooled in an isolated small four walled building such as a manipulated environment others call school/the point of being schooled is education. Get a grip you who took these children away. you should be ashamed of yourselves.

             The government needs to back up and quit trying to ruin  familys. COS was meant to protect child from being beaten not loved. Back in the old days this education was good enough for our parents and grandparents and they turned out to be very good people. Look at the kids in public schools and tell me this is a better alternative.

             Who says they have to be like everyone else so consumed with the world and technology or even if they homestead no big deal.
             <br/>
             If the children in a truly bad situation then that is different. I dont know all the details but if there is nothing wrong then that is wrong.  just some thoughts..
             <br/>
             by the way no one takes children away from the Mormons or Amish etc. people have rights and there are children all over the world home schooled every day/ Actors and actors kids/or kids of those who always have to travel due to there jobs etc. It is terrorization or harassment and infringement on others right just because they choose to live differently then you. That is not a crime. I have traveled the world and have seen much and I so hesitate to judge others and know to seek out knowledge and understanding and in all my getting get understanding. they should leave this family alone. so what. who are they to come in and decide how they live. It is also proven that home-schooled children are better educated and better equipped to handle life and college and anything than those schooled in an isolated small four walled building such as a manipulated environment others call school/the point of being schooled is education. Get a grip you who took these children away. you should be ashamed of yourselves.

               Just to touch on the education part of this (as a homeschool teacher) when you compare them to the Amish you need to do some research. Amish children go to school from 6-14 then they work as an apprentice in what ever field they decide they want to go into. Their teacher attend workshops, conference, further their education  and some are certified to teach. Some Amish children attend Rural public schools as well. Also , Amish children have homes that include 4 walls and out houses not holes in the ground. I have done extensive research on the Amish community and their way of life should not be compared to this. They have easy access to clean water as well as doctors.
               <br/>
               These parents say they homeschool but do not have any of the documentation to go along with it. I do not believe that these children need to be taken away from their parents but I do believe that their living conditions need to improve. I hope and pray what ever happens with this case the children are put first. They are the only ones that people should be conserned about. The parents chose this life the kids did not.

             I have really enjoyed reading all the responses to this article, and then looking up what facts I could find independent of the article.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems to me that the whole anti government narrative pushed by some has become almost like a religion, to where even somebody who is of questionable character who gets in trouble for really doing wrong is made into a folk hero because every case of the government doing something to protect kids, even if it is justified succumbs to the narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sort of reminds me of a lady I used to know who was in my goat organization.  She had 2 foster kids and had moved here from TX.  CPS had been to her house and I heard from her and her friends that they were harassing them. Then one day she brought the kids to a meeting. They were both non verbal disabled and large and she could not take care of them. They were dirty and stunk like street people. Finally one of them fell into a wood stove and was seriously burned because he was neurologically messed up and CPS took them. Later on I brought her some hay and her livestock were all penned in this tiny little place, and her house and everything was really filthy.  I lost contact with her but then twice later she was brought up on animal cruelty charges and had all her animals taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             To hear her and her pals talk it it was  govt persecution. To the normal person it was justified. I think it does a disservice to the people who work for CPS and other agencies to lionize people who are truly negligent. However like I say some peoples beliefs about the the evil govt are based on their beliefs not always on reality, and they have a hard time dealing with reality if it does not conform to their beliefs.

               Jim, your story is full of holes.
              </p>
              <p>
               First, IF the subject lady in your story had two foster children, it would have been difficult for her to have moved from one state to another, since foster children are wards of a particular state.
              </p>
              <p>
               Second, foster parents have an obligation to report certain things to CPS, and I would guess that if a foster family is given permission to move to another state, more contacts than usual might be required.
              </p>
              <p>
               Third, your comments on the disabilities of the foster children blame the foster parent for the disabilities, when most likely the childrens disabilities originated prior to CPS seizing the children and placing them with a foster family.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fourth and finally, I assert that beliefs by DEFINITION are not based on reality.  Not just some peoples beliefs but everyones beliefs, including yours and mine.  Remember that in a FREE country, we have the RIGHT to whatever beliefs we may hold, so long as we infringe on no one elses rights in our expression of said beliefs.

             Have any of you ever heard of Ronald Gene Simmons. If not look him up. Very similar story with a very different and tragic ending. Better to investigate and be wrong than do nothing. I witnessed part of that tragic few days and wouldnt wish it on anyone. They lived a similar lifestyle. They also ended up digging their own mass grave thinking they were digging a new outhouse.

             Wow. I have just finished reading through the responses. I must say, I am ashamed for all who have come to condemn. You lack understanding of how to truly live off grid without Air conditioning in the summer and with only wood heat in the winter. I did it growing up for a year. When the weather is warm, you keep the windows open all the time, you need the ventilation. In the winter, you start a fire and close the windows. Now lets apply that to this supposed three wall housewhich just happened to be shown (guess when?) in The summer. You know? I wish i could have unscrewed a wall to let a little more air in during the summer, Makes it so very much Cooler. I did see one picture shown in the winter.had a window shut and an actual door next to the shelving with food on it. compare that to the summer picture and you will notice that the door was replaced with a open weave thin cloth to let the air through, if you wet it, it helps cool things down too. I am amazed at the shear stupidity of those who have never experienced what its like to live less complicated and not try and keep up with the Jones next door. Humans are much more hardier than most realize. When you raise children, they respond with absolute resilience, their immune systems are stronger, their bones are stronger, the psychological health is fabulous. Now lets compare that with the New jersey lady who was on FOX News just after the HURRICANE blew through (keep in mind that nauseating Jersey accent)  WE GOT NO POWER&lt; WE ARE GONNA DIE IF WE DONT GET POWER". I think that sums up the stupidity of those who are too cowardly and weak. hey FRANKyea, you may have grew up in a cabin in Alaska, but Kentucky isn't Alaska, different techniques are used in other geographical areas to accommodate the climate, and its obvious you were never really challenged. Im of native American Heritage, yet the Europeans thought us ignorant and uneducated, but without Native American HELP, well you know what would have happened. Oh, one more thing, I saw several pictures of springs, and a pond/lake on their propertyseems to me they can survive and thrive quite will. (mumble mumble ignorant  wannabeejudgejuryexecutionerselfrightiousbigots)

             HA! These kids were NOT taken due to homeschooling or living off the grid. They were taken from filthy, unsafe, abusive and disgusting circumstances. At least get it right and quit making these people out to be saints when theyre just lazy assholes who wont use birth control or take care of their kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hate morons who make trash into saints for no reason but to further their own cause. Such as anyone supporting these wannabe adults with long ass records proving theyre just thieves and trash.

             This story is tragic in so many ways.  Living conditions appear to be poor.  Sadly I can drive anywhere these days and find families living on the streets completely homeless, no water, no toilet, no ice box, no bed, no food, no schooling and no internet.  No agency is taking their kids for being homeless.  Seems all of Americas help is focused on illegal aliens instead of low/no income families and Veterans. This family is obviously  struggling and could use a little help but destroying a family is not help.  The money being PAID to these foster homes would go along ways in correcting what the politicians find wrong with this situation.  There is no indication of any physical abuse to anyone in the family.  It does not appear the kids are demonstrating and destroying other peoples property as we see performed in Baltimore, Ferguson and other ghetto ridden areas.  What it does appear like is some snooty neighbor became angry for some reason and went wild with accusations about this family who apparently has lived this way for over fifteen years. Schooling is important but I also feel that todays schools are not working in the childrens best interest and should leave politics alone and return to basics.  IF the family needs help, provide it but dont destroy them~~~~

               I think thats the point.  This family doesnt want help.  They want this lifestyle with a shack, hole in the ground for a toilet, and no running water.  Why should we subsidize adults who have actively chosen this lifestyle for themselves when they could go out and get jobs in order to improve their situation if they wanted to?

             I cant believe the officials would do such a thing!! Home schooled children are very smart and they sound like a happy fsmily. The authorities didnt have probable cause and the way they tricked the mom unto leaving her property then arrested her was down right unacceptable and all legal fees should be dropped and this family should start a lawsuit against them. If the pond is on their property, and out of the city, they dont need to put a fence up and the children sounded happy and healthy!! Put this family back together.

               Have you listened to the recorded audio interaction between Nicole and the sheriff?  The sheriff was very clear what she needed to do.  Someone had called in a complaint (consisting of the father pulling a gun on the complaintant on the complaintants property, lack of an education for the kids, and deplorable living conditions), CPS investigated the grounds earlier but the family was not there, CPS found substandard and unsafe living conditions, and the sheriff needed to talk to the family, both kids and adults (as is typical in these cases).  Nicole refused to allow her teenage boys to talk to the sheriff, despite him warning her at least 10 times that they may be taken away from her if he cant talk to them.  Additionally, this family had been investigated in the past (more than once) following this same procedure and after talking to all involved, the sheriff department/CPS gave them a warning.  Its clear from the audio, thats what he wanted to do this time.  He was practically begging her to let him talk to the kids so he could close this case and be done with it.  But Nicole refused time and time again, which leads one to wonder why.  If theyd done this before and everything turned out fine, why not let the kids talk so they could be on their merry way?  Unless they had something to hide or were for once afraid of what the kids might say

             Unschooling is an absolutely legitimate form of homeschooling.  It appears this family is not unschooling or homeschooling as they did not file paperwork as required by law in their state. Perhaps they DO school at home in some format but officially at least they are not homeschoolers.
            </p>
            <p>
             What needs to be made clear in my opinion is that IF this family were put at risk by CPS just because of their homeschooling choices that would be horribly unacceptable wrong.  Homeschooling or unschooling is legal and can be a wonderful thing and many loving homes (which provide their kids with ample food, shelter, and safety) choose this option for their children.  We are very happy homeschoolers who do some unschooling and some more structured stuff and we HOPE sincerely that anyone reading about this or any other family willl not draw any negative conclusions about homeschooling OR unschooling (or mindfully living off the grid for that matter) because of this one situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             IF the kids are safe and well fed but the family needs help, nobody should take the kids away. They need to offer the shelter, clothing, or necessities needed.  If the kids arent safe but arent in imminent danger CPS (or whatever entity it is) should do their best to keep the kids at home and help the family with safety.  This would apply to kids in school or out of school as there are kids in schools who also come home to possibly unsafe conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would be upset to know that a family is hiding behind a homeschooling or unschooling label to cover up other issues.  Homeschoolers ARE targeted just for homeschooling when safety and shelter are not an issue. THIS is why many homeschoolers are up in arms.  We dont want to lose the right to homeschool.  And yet perhaps we have to be careful to really behind homeschooling choices but to make sure that families we support are not abusing the homeschool (or unschool) designation just to gain support.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bottom line I think is that homeschooling AND unschooling legally (per state guidelines) is a great and wonderful choice for many of us whose kids thrive academically and socially under this umbrella.  But its indeed not an umbrella under which to hide if the kids are at risk for non-educational purposes.

             You know there are many people without running water but still have clean water and adequate living conditions (you do not need a large home, with rooms for each child). There are plenty of people that have a loft and 2 bedroom homes and 6 kids with 2 adults in them and raise their children just fine. I for one am tired of politics taking first over family well beings. It did not say in this article if the Sherriff, Prosecuting Attorney, or Judge is up for re-election or not ( since that is a primary factory in a lot of these cases anymore). As long as the home was clean and they were homeschooling their children and they were fed and clothed they should have been left alone.

             As long as the children is being taken care of and getting what they need to eat and clothing. I think they should be allow to live the way they want. I use to live without a lot of things that we have today, my family use to live off the land and no one cared. I home schooled my children and they turned out o k. They should be able to do what they want.

             My hopes for this family are that the children get nice warm beds,clean clothes,decent food,and an education. For the mother to get mental help that she so clearly needs and for the father to gain employment and stop being so lazy. The first thing he did was start a GoFundMe account. This man doesnt even seem to try to be the man of the family.Think of your children! Please! I wouldnt allow my animals to live in these kind of conditions. God bless these babies they deserve so much more.

             I live in Kentucky as well and my wife has 3 boys and they are from Ohio. I asked her to come and live with me in Kentucky and to marry me. That week they moved to Kentucky and we enrolled the children into school here in ky and the youngest one was still to young to go so he was with us when we went to the food stamp office to apply for food assistance. My fiance at the time my wife now had spent 10 years with a man that abused her and finally got the courage to take the kids and leave. When the man who is also the father of the kids found out where she was he went there and ripped the phone out of the wall and proceeded to beat my wife to death in front of his 3 children. The oldest ran to a neighbors house in order to call 911. The dad was gone by time police got there and thought my wife was dead when he left her there. A helicopter was landed on highway beside her house and she was airlifted to a hospital in Ohio where she was in a coma for three days. She has slurred speech now and has lost some of her equalibrium and balance along with eye sight being badly damaged. I told that story to tell you this oneThe day we went to apply for food assistance I was driving as she has no license and she was on her cell phone talking to her mother when we walked into the office to sign in. Obviously one of the workers there heard her speech and assumed she was impaired and therefore I must have been too and we had a 4 year old child with us at the time. So someone there called the police on us and the next thing we know 2 county sheriff deputies came in and separated my wife and I into 2 different rooms and the child was with me. they gave me a field sobriety test and came to the conclusion that I was not intoxicated in any shape or form but because my wife could not pass the field sobriety test they automatically assumed she was intoxicated on some narcotic or controlled substance and was even told by the deputy that she was scum and that if he was her he would walk to the bridge and jump in the river. They then let me go and took her to the county jail for public intoxication charge and took the child from me and went and got the other 2 children out of school and put them in foster care. 4 hours later my wife was released to me from jail and after taking a drug test only was found with marijuana in her system and that is all. And truth is it was in my system too as when you smoke marijuana it stays in your system for 30 days or longer (the only drug that stays in your system that long). Anyways the children were in 7 different schools and foster care homes in 16 months time as they were mistreated and had to keep being moved to different foster homes as a result. Then the craziest thing happened The man that made her speech the way it is today and made her balance to never be the same again and that tried to kill her 4 years earlier was out of jail and out of the half way house and the judge over the case sought him out as he was the biological father and he came to Kentucky court from his home in Ohio and the judge over the case gave this man sole custody of our children. They were with this man for 5 months at the most when he called and said he could not do it anymore and even brought the dog down to us to live here because they were all starving to death. The oldest child did not even have clothes because there dad and his girlfriends stole his clothes and anything else of value that they had and sold them to support their heroin habits. So we now have the children back living with us in the state of Kentucky where they were to begin with and wanted to be all along except now the man my wife spent 10 years trying to get away from has control of her children and threatens to come and take them anytime she does not do as he instructs her to do. All because we went in an office to apply for food assistance and my wife has bad speech. Does this sound like justice to you?

             I can not say a whole lot on this because this is the first time I have heard about it. But just by looking at the picture and into those faces of each of those children, I can tell they are very well loved and cared for. Those are not faces of mistreated children. Those faces say it all!  Faces full of hope and love! But I can reassure you they will not be the next time you see them! They will need help to get through all of this evil that was done to them. The bible says it is better to put a mill stone around your neck and be thrown into the sea than to hurt one of Gods little ones! Mark Gods words, they will stand before the almighty one day and they will have to account for what they have done.

             Why are people donating to this family?  The dad, who set up the GoFundMe account, not a friend as this article states, is asking for $45k to make updates to his homestead, buy computers/tablets for his children, and purchase a new vehicle.  Why should we help them when the parents have chosen an off-the-grid lifestyle where they do not work traditional jobs and do not get a traditional paycheck.  If they need that money to adequately provide for all their children, then GET JOBS.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im most shocked by the anti-government folks who are donating to this family.  This right here is exactly what youre against  the wealthy supporting the poor.  But, rather than the government forcing you to do it, youre being scammed into doing it by a very conniving man who uses trigger words to ignite a brewing anger in a large subpopulation of our society. People see those trigger words and jump on the bandwagon without doing any research.  Please take a moment to think about this before you donate!  Do you want to help a family that doesnt help themselves?

               FINALLY someone who speaks with some commons sense.
               <br/>
               My hackles are really up on this one;  it is fine to live off the grid if you can be truly self-sustaining, but this family has spiraled down into poverty and is expecting handouts, while all the while the parents rail  against the government and its bullying agencies.
              </p>
              <p>
               They prefer handouts to working regular jobs like other American families who also have families to support.   Living the way they do was to an extent a choice, however the deplorable conditions the children live in is not a choice that the kids should have to endure.

             I am a single father of 4 children out of Indiana. I had a similar situation, where a upset ex-wife and a disgruntled Child Services worker accused me of neglect and abuse. Even going as far as arresting me and taking my children. Putting them in foster care, forcing services on us repeatedly. I fought for nearly 2 years, spent nearly $1 million, mostly paid by medical insurance for assessments. I argued from the beginning they were only doing this for the money. Interestingly enough, when they exhausted the limits of my insurance, without explaination or reason, they closed the case, returned my children and terminated further counseling.   Its been nearly 2-1/2 years since my situation began and I have I believe 1 or 2 more court hearings before this will be completely behind us. Everyone I have involved in my case, including Counselors and several attorneys have sided with me and only tell me that I can only just go along with the process. Even though DCS and their subordinates do harm to our family they are mostly protected under the law to take as long as they need to investigate and assess us until they have exhausted all reasonable doubt of claims of neglect or abuse. Even my kids will tell them to go fuck themselves, which DCS responded by making them take anger management counseling. DCS tried to trick the kids to sign papers to say they didnt want   to live with their dad and that they were afraid of him. When I noticed what they were trying to get them to sign and explained it to the kids, they refused to sign. DCS tried every angle trying to get the kids to make a statement to the judge that they didnt want to live with me. The kids repeatedly would tell them they there was no reason for them to be afraid of their dad.
             <br/>
             The county this happened in, Fayette County, in the time this incident occurred. Almost all employees, including administration, were asked to resign. I can only speculate because of investigations involving their operations. To this day, Fayette County DCS and the Pavilion that helped them assess my family will not talk to us or comment to anything they did to our family. They act like nothing happened.  BTW, the Pavilion intake specialist was also the marketing specialist, who was all good friends with all the DCS staff, who throughout their careers have worked for both DCS and the pavilion. I could go on all day about the unprofessional and unethical behaviors that were inflicted on my family. At the end of the day my family is back together, we had to move out of Fayette County because of how corrupt and unsafe it was for my family. Its sad that an agency that claims to protect children has so much authority and gives its employees that much power to destroy families.

             IMHO these two parents are a couple of asshats. If you have kids, try and give them the best one can. They didnt do that, just kept popping them out. Shelter, food, water. Those are the basics. Education, done properly, is really important. Have to know enough to survive

             All other news sources mention the fact that the unschooling piece was a red herring.  They believe in the unschooling movementkids learn through doing just normal things, read:  parent too lazy to teach their kids how to read, etc.  The main reason the authorities came in were the horrid conditions.  12 people, one baby on the way, were living in squalor:  a lean-to, garbage and broken glass strewn about the area, no running war, no well and the father was stealing clean water from other neighbors wells.  He was brandishing fire arms and showing erratic behavior.  So yeah, this article is pretty damn biased.

             While I wouldnt choose to live in their cabin, make shift home, I also am not going to judge them. Their children appear happy and there is nothing indicating abuse or otherwise. I aspire to live the life they live with my own children, only in a Yurt! I hope their children are returned soon and that this whole situation has not caused them too much emotional trauma!!

             Alot of the article is false,  the kids were only taken after mother refused to let sheriff interview them for social service.   The father pulled a gun on a neighbor after he was told to stop stealing get water from the neighbors well.  And they are not off the grid the mom has a blob asking for money.

               yes lets all donate.. they dont need welfare because they have their minions donating at the drop of a hat.. they are building a state of the art grooming shop that is 100% funded by some group and donations. and now you are all going to buy them a fancy new house.. and keep encouraging their bad behavior. joes oldest son testified against them today in court, think about this.. if they really wanted to get out of poverty why are they having another child. i understand your alls concern about the government but this is not the case with these people. they are not good people they are scammers, bullies, and bad parents.

             Sometimes its not about being homeschooled or being a christian or living off grid.  Sometimes there are people who fail their children and should not be allowed to put them @ risk.

             To the people who do not believe that the Cabinet behaves this way, please understand they do, and this is par for the course with them, and every other Child Protective Service in the USA.  Like most of you, we too did not believe that Due Process was routinely trampled in Family/Dependency court.  We learned the hard way when the Directors niece and nephew were taken and were refused placement with relatives for the unforgivable reason of being out of state.  Oh, and the grandmother was refused placement because she has a pool.

             For the article author, have you connected them to HSLDA (and since you are off-grid peeps, all your readers should be told about them)?  They offer insurance to protect them in cases like this.  If the family didnt have insurance already, HSLDA might still be able to help considering the noteworthy aspects of the case.

             Okay Ladies and Gentleman, how many of you know the truth about what took place??  Does anyone really know what happens in another persons house 24/7?  Obviously child abuse should never be tolerated, but rearing children off-grid and Un-schooling are not abuse.  There have been people who have said that I should have my children taken away.  The United Nations Rights of the Child and United Nations Rights of Persons with Disabilities would have had my children removed from our home for Homeschooling and for Homeschooling a child with disabilities while having epilepsy myself.  We have taught our children in several ways, Un-schooling being one.  My children have not suffered, one son scored 26 on his ACT is a future Paramedic, one son is a future Deputy Sheriff.  I dont think we have harmed or abused them in any way.  Until you have all the facts, try not to judge the family, just be aware of your government and the overreaching authority we have given them.

             As I said, Imho the parents are asshats. However the kids look healthy enough. Funny story, years ago our youngest told his kindergarten teacher that I beat him unmercifully. He was a handful, to say the least. She called CPS. They ordered us to bring him to their offices for a interview and inspection. Walking into the building, I told him to give them the full treatment. Took us to an interrogation room and an older lady finally showed up, made him strip standing on the table in front of her. Checked his butt, legs and back. No marks or bruises any place. Then he turned around and rubbed lil willie and his twins all over her mouth and face. I was so proud of him. After the ol gal recovered, she told mom and me to discipline him however, just dont leave any marks. Hes a grown man today and does well, we still laugh about that episode.

             Now I have been called a bully , and mean by others for voicing my opposing viewpoint about this issue , well I am here to state again the law of cause and effect . Not at all to say the law is absolute or perfect. I would however like to agree with a woman by the name of Ann , who commented on May the 8th of this month 2015 ,I would love to see the official arrest record, not personal opinion pieces.

            How To Turn Your Home Into A Fortress!
           </span>
          </a>
          <br/>
          Today, youre in more danger than ever before of becoming a victim of a crime. Step outside your home and count two houses to your left. Now count two houses to your right. Between you and your four neighbors, chances are that at least one of the five households will experience a break-in or worse, a home invasion. Every year, there are over 8,000 home invasions in North America. Theres probably nothing more terrifying than a home invasion. Ask anyone whose home has ever been robbed what if feels like, and theyll say it feels like they were violated. Sadly, thats not just a metaphorall too often, its literal. Because not only do criminals violate what should be your sanctuary from the world and walk away.
