       <p>
        What sounds reside in spiral seashells? For generations, people who live by the sea have held that, when pressed to the ear, seashells resound with something like the roar of the oceana sensation whose explanation has offered a puzzle pleasurable and provocative to scientists and lay listeners alike.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        In his 1915
        <em>
         Book of Wonders
        </em>
        , popular science writer Rudolph Bodmer suggested that the association followed from the symbolic power of shells: The sounds we hear when we hold a sea shell to the ear are not really the sound of the sea waves. We have come to imagine that they are because they sound like the waves of the sea, and knowledge that the shell originally came from the sea helps us to this conclusion very easily.
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
        But the likeness, he urged, had a technical explanationthough one in which similitude still figured. Both sea and seashell sounds were generated by waves: The sounds we hear in the sea shell are really air waveswaves, that is, of concentrated, resonant noise from the listeners surroundings.
       </p>
       <p>
        That explanation sought to supplant superstition with science, trading sublime enchantment for fascinating fact. The account in Bodmers book rested on a century of empirical and theoretical investigation in which sound had come to be understood as vibration, and not, as earlier, more numinously, on the model of music or voice, exampling what Jonathan Sterne names as a shift from models of sound reproduction based on imitations of the mouth to models based on imitations of the ear.
        <sup>
         3
        </sup>
       </p>
       <p>
        Tune in a century later, however, and ear-centered explanations like Bodmers coil in on themselves; his explanation of seashell resonance (in agreement with scientific thinking then and now) loses out in most popular accounts to the erroneous claim that what we hear in seashells is the flow of our own blood. Jennifer Lawsons 2001
        <em>
         Hands-on Science and Technology
        </em>
        asserts, Many students will tell you that they hear the ocean in the seashell. Actually, the dull roaring sound they hear is the echo of the blood moving inside their ear.
        <sup>
         4
        </sup>
        OMGFACTS.comthe #1 fact source on Twitter, and a contemporary analog, perhaps, to the
        <em>
         Book of Wonders
        </em>
        offers, When you put a seashell next to your ear, its the sound of your blood surging in your veins, not the ocean.
        <sup>
         5
        </sup>
        Oceanic other, sounded out, outs itself as inside noise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why this slide from the sound science of reverberating air to the sciency-sounding flow of blood? In 1889, Robert E. C. Stearns coined the term ethno-conchology to describe how shells have been curiously interwoven with the affairs of men, both in civilized and barbarous communities.
        <sup>
         6
        </sup>
        I suggest that the changing ratios of ocean, air, and blood in seashell sound accountings track a European-Atlantic-American ethno-conchology, one that unrolls from Romantic enthrallment toward a double-edged modernity that uses the language of science to disenchant at one moment and then re-enchant at another. This essay puts an ear to popular science and poetry, following a history that has, first, shells singing, speaking, sighing, and echoing distant oceanic and communal pasts, and next, shells reflecting back the personal and present moment, and, then, as we approach today, delivering sounds imagined deep inside, rather than outside, human bodies. At stake are changing models of the relation between hearing, the world, and the self, with the avowedly mystical and communal gradually replaced by the secular, scientific, and individualthough, with the arrival of the blood-in-the-ears interpretation, infused anew with an element of the mythical.

         Speaking Shells
        </span>
        Begin with shelly speech. Around 1800, William Wordsworth wrote of a dream in which he was given a book in the form of a shell / Of a surpassing brightness. Instructed to hold it to his ear, he did so,
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,
        </em>
        <em>
         <br/>
         Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,
        </em>
        <em>
         <br/>
         A loud prophetic blast of harmony;

       <p>
        English and American poetry through the nineteenth century continued to hear speech in seashells, sometimes clear, sometimes ghostly.
        <sup>
         8
        </sup>
        Wordsworths ode came from the future (a prophetic blast), but mostand we need not distinguish between lesser and greater poetsheard sounds from a distant past:

        While poets invited readers to listen at seashell lips and hear tales of ships, scientists put forward accounts of seashell sound as the result of wave mechanics. The explanation was in place by 1835, in a college textbook:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The concave, undulating, and perfectly polished surface of many sea shells, fit them to catch, to concentrate, and to return the pulses of all sounds that happen to be trembling about them, so as to produce that curious resonance from within, which resembles the distant murmur of the ocean.

        <em>
         Sports and Amusements for the Juvenile Philosopher
        </em>
        translated this accounting for a younger readership: The interior of the shell merely concentrates and thus multiplies the sounds around us, so as to render them audible.

        The language of vibration became a steady feature in such explanations, as, for example, in 1857s

         On the Sensations of Tone

        Such ear-shell connections were in the making earlier (rendering this whole history, perhaps, more spiral than linear, with symbolisms washing to and fro, especially in the devious sounding devices that are poems). Paduan anatomist Gabriele Falloppio, describing the spiral cavity in the inner ear in 1561, called it the
        <em>
         cochlea

        Ear-seashell analogies remain saturated with the oceanic. Tara Rodgers explains that the ear has been construed as holding an ocean within: the term ear canal itself evokes a channel of water for navigation, an arm of the sea.

        advanced a vibrant analogy of sound and water waves that transposed this turbulent fluidity of the sounding world onto the interior of the subject. Jeans wrote:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Sound reaches our ears in the form of waves which have travelled through the surrounding air, much as waves travel over the surface of a sea or river; some of these waves travel down the inch-long backwater formed by the auditory canal, and finally encounter the ear-drum, which forms a barrier at the far end.

        Walter Benjamin played with the notion that shells contain worldly echoes, writing in the 1930s about his childhood around 1900: Like a mollusk in its shell, I held my abode in the nineteenth century, which now lies hollow before me like an empty shell. Imagining he could hold that century to his ear, he asked, What do I hear? answering,

         the brief clatter of the anthracite as it falls from the coal shuttle into a cast-iron stove, the dull pop of the flame as it ignites in the gas mantle, and the clinking of the lampshade on its brass ring when a vehicle passes by on the street. And other sounds as well, like the jingling of the basket of keys, or the ringing of the two bells at the front and back steps.

        <sup>

        This, argues Ryder, is the acoustical unconscious (or un-
        <em>
         conch
        </em>
        -ious). But Benjamins is also a moment in Euro-conchology in which shells concentrate memory by gathering the history of the vibrating world around them. We have the meeting of two models for seashell sound: a mythic model that has seashells as channels for voices from a communal past, and a materialist model that has seashells as resonant chambers of individual, located experience.

        Seashells echoing back sounds around usthat interpretation might have been that, were it not for the fact that today a weird explanation of seashell sound has wormed its way into folk acoustics: that shells amplify the flow of listeners own blood. Although I have not been able to trace a definitive origin, the notion appears in the late nineteenth century. From 1882:

        For this explanation to gather momentum, blood must first be imagined to have a sound. Such became newly possible with the stethoscope, invented in 1816 and fine-tuned through the nineteenth century. Interestingly, the sounds it delivered were sometimes compared to those from a seashell. An 1893 manual: The principal pathological venous murmur is the
        <em>
         venous hum
        </em>
        or
        <em>
         bruit de diable
        </em>
        . It is compared to the sound heard on placing a sea shell of moderately large size against the ear.
        <sup>
         30
        </sup>
        It would be important for doctors not to confuse the sound of blood with stethoscopic channels; an 1886 advertisement for a binaural stethoscope suggests that an imperfect device reminds us of the childs toy resonator, a sea-shell.
        <sup>
         31
        </sup>
        But if seashells play tricks, stethoscopes enable people to imagine hearing their own blood.

        One can find the blood-echo explanation these days in many venues, mostlyironicallyeducational ones devoted to clearing up misconceptions of scientific facts. The 1993 textbook
        <em>
         Science Interactions
        </em>
        reports, What youre really hearing is the sound of your own blood rushing through the vessels inside your ear. You normally dont hear this sound. The seashell makes it easier for you to hear it.

        <em>

        from 2000 suggests, The seashells hard, smooth surface bounces, or echoes, the sound of the flowing blood back into your ears. This sound is very much like the sound of the ocean.
        <sup>
         35
        </sup>
        Even rationalist skeptic Carl Sagan got behind this angle: Everyone knows the sound of the sea to be heard when putting a seashell to ones ear. It is really the greatly amplified sound of our own blood rushing.

         When you put a seashell up to your ear, what you hear is not the ocean. The sound comes from inside your own ear. The inner part of your ear, the part that is far back into your head, has both bone parts and soft tissue parts. In between these is your cochlea, which is a tiny organ that looks like a snails shell. Your cochlea is filled with fluid. This fluid helps you transmit sounds from your eardrum to your brain. And it sloshes around like waves. We dont usually hear this sound because it is so quiet. But when you hold a seashell to your ear, this small sound echoes off the shell and back into your ear.

        This explanation recalls Jeanss conception of the ear holding its own ocean. But how has the blood-(or other fluid)-in-the-ears account gained its popularity?
       </p>
       <p>
        The shell, which in Wordsworth had a tongue and an articulate sound, came to have a voice whose speech (Rosetti, Webb) was always competing with the moan of unceasing music (Welby), a sigh (Rosetti, Quarmby), an echo, or a murmur (Rosetti, Brnhielm). The murmur became vibratory, a sign of present-day rather than long-ago worlds. It blurred boundaries between mouth and ear, and the shell became like a telephoneas in Holmess 1871 poem in which shell is lips
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        ear, a chamber of echoes conjoining listening and speaking, turning auditors back on themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        That transformation prepared the way for a model of subjectivity in which people could imagine themselves sensing themselves sensing. Fast forward to a key moment in the history of modernist sound. In the early 1950s, after visiting an anechoic chamber, a room designed to absorb all sound, composer John Cage wrote: In that silent room, I heard two sounds, one high and one low. Afterward I asked the engineer in charge why, if the room was so silent, I had heard two sounds. He said, Describe them. I did. He said, The high one was your nervous system in operation. The low one was your blood in circulation.
        <sup>
         39
        </sup>
        As Douglas Kahn has observed, Cage, who in most settings refused to ask after the source of sounds (he wanted sounds to be themselves), here conjured a dematerialized, disembodied self: a listener inside the shell of the body.

The echoing ocean, once dethroned by vibrating air, has now been displaced by brute blood, something of a solipsistic surrogate for the salty sea. But what the ocean wave and blood pulse explanations have in common is the idea that human experience reaches into depths we cannot fathomthat what we feel in the moment arrives from far away or inside, from zones that evade direct apprehension.

         Spiral shells were new in Romantic poetry, displacing scalloped shells (which had been employed as sounding boards for lyres): The seashell indicates the emergence of a new image of poetic voice as that which releases powers trapped in nature and in objects by breathing in (inspiring) voice as
         <em>
          pneuma
         </em>
         or spirit.  [But]  the voice or music which is projected from a seashell is not an original, external sound, but a series of echoes  the shell transforms these sounds by submitting them to the transforming acoustic of its resonating cavities, whether these belong to a seashell or to the Romantic poet.

         Medical professionals argue that ones blood cannot be heard from within: The ear filters out or minimizes these sounds. Thus, for instance, the auditory ossicles (the
         <em>
          malleus
         </em>
         ,
         <em>

         <em>
          stapes

         ) are separated by fluid-filled membranes that reduce bone-conducted vibration. Sounds from inside the body are screened out so as to make the outside world audible. Ackerman suggests that, were this not to occur, even the sound of a persons own blood flow would be as deafening as sitting in a lawn chair next to a waterfall.
