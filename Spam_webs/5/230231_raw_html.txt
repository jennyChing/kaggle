             In 1786, Jefferson and John Adams met with Tripolis ambassador to Great Britain. They asked this diplomat by what right his nation attacked American ships and enslaved her citizens and why the Muslims held such hostility toward this new nation, with which neither Tripoli nor any of the other Barbary Coast nations had any previous contact. The answer was quite revealing. Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja

             That is indeed quite revealing. Yet, America continued paying ransoms to these terrorists for the next fifteen years or so. Until Jefferson became President. Then, the Pasha (leader) of Tripoli sent a demand to the new leader for an immediate payment of $225,000 and $25,000 per year on an ongoing basis. Jefferson flatly refused, leading the Pasha to cut down the flagpole of the American consulate and declaring war on the United States. The rest of the terrorist states followed suit.

            <p style="color: #444444;">
             Jefferson had formerly been against raising a navy, but this soon changed as he was determined to meet force with force. A squadron of vessels was sent to the area and Congress authorized Jefferson to have the US ships seize all vessels and goods that belonged to the Pasha and anything else deemed necessary. As they saw the US was actually committed to the fight, Algiers and Tunis quickly abandoned the war and allegiance to Tripoli. Obviously, the US won the war. In fact, this was the reason why the line to the shores of Tripoli was added to the Marine Corps hymn.

                    Considering similar passages exist in the Bible and Talmud, Id argue its more important to keep out most Mohammedans than the Koran, based on Ben Franklins statement on Religious freedom that even a Mohammedan could be accepted, noting tone was that it was theoretical and confirmed by 1921 immigration quotas.  We could take a few of the best, brightest and most easily assimilated folks from places like Lebanon, Syria.  The problem with Saudi, Yemen and Somalia is even if 95% dont act up, the 5% which do can wreak havoc.

                          First, two sides can use the same tactic for different ends.  Second, the liberal tactic is to cry racist, not spell errors.  Third, the use of later can also be a mistake in meaning vs spelling.  Fourth, a Muslim is not a heathen;  [Google Search: a person who does not belong to a widely held religion (especially one who is not a Christian, Jew, or Muslim) as regarded by those who do] so Moslems are not heathen, and this could be slap at pre-Christian Europeans.  Fifth, much as I hate to see mosques in the US, there is one silver lining  these folks will have no sympathy to the Marxist Jews who are influencing the immigration policy, and fear of Moslems may cause them to let up on open borders, or at least if that policy wipes us out, those Marxists will not win, because the numerous Moslems will eat them up.

                          Let me rephrase my earlier description of many Muslims: bloodthirsty murderous theocratic ideologues.

                         <p>
                          While I would agree that not all Muslims are the likes of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Etc (I have a extended family member who converted to Islam and she is one of the sweetest people I know). However, the only thing separating the Muslims who behead, rape, execute for not converting to Islam, Etc. and the moderate Muslims is the latter choose not to follow the Quran completely and live in peace. The book teaches the same things to both types!

                          I dont know who these Marxist Jews are that you are referring to, but members of the Obamas administration with Socialist/Communist views are the ones responsible for the immigration bullshit, along with establishment members of Congress who only care about getting reelected. Marxists are for a classless society in which there is no exploitation of the poor by the rich.  Sounds a lot like Liberal Democrats to me!!

                          Marxist Jews like the three Communist parties killed in 79 in Greensboro, and those Churchill appealed to in an open letter in 1920 to embrace Zionism over Marxism.  You are a Zionist Jew living in a foreign country not a Conservative Republican, troll, who cares little for Stephen Decatur and TJ and our war vs Barbary pirates under the banner of Thousands for defense and not one penny for tribute to a general anti-Muslim view for the benefit of your people.  Stop pretending to be one of us.

                          A bit of advice:   If I were you, I wouldnt call someone an idiot for using later instead of latter  and then in my very next post, use an unnecessary apostrophe in a plural noun.

                        Although both have had their own problems in the past, the Jewish nor the Christian Bible teaches what the Quran teaches. If you ever check it out it is about forcing other peoples/religions to submit to Islam(means submission) or die.

                          Do you see Christians or Jews beheading people who wont convert? Or flying airplanes into The Dome of the Rock?The devil can quote scripture for his purposesbut most of us ignore those passages anymore. And they dont say to kill those who dont believethey say that if unbelievers will be judged by God. You read the Bible dingbattheres a difference.

                          The Jews are the elder Monotheistic by 3.8 millennia. The Christians are the elder child. The Muslims are around 620 years later. A note though. At the beginning, they were developing science and maths. Then the Crusades began. They began to evolve too. Then we waged war on them and they donkey stuborned into the Mohammed era and never left again.

                          Considering they were developing science and math before Islam was even a notion in Mohameds pea brain, Id say Islam is to blame for Muslim nations being mostly low-tech morons (even though some are wealthy off of oil).

                          advanced math came from the middle east, actually in domascus, schollars had already accurately estimated the circumference of the earth and the early theories about the dision of the smallest form of matter to unleash energy  (the theory behind nuclear fission)
                          <br/>
                          And the literacy rate in the middle east were WAY higher than that of Europe, Not the mention hygienic practices.  the only European that took to bathing regularly in those days were the crusaders that stage in the middle east.

                          Jabir Ibn Hayyan was a scientist who was working off o the greek ideal that the Atom was the smallest form of indivisible matter, however, he challenged it by suggesting that is COULD be divided, however doing so would unleash so much energy is could level a city the size of Baghdad. sounds and awful lot like nuclear fission before they had the technology or the materials to put their theory to practice.

                          morton MADE it about islam with the whole:
                          <br/>
                          The Jews evolved past the Talmud eons ago, as did the Christians evolve past the dark ages.  Islam is stuck in the dark

                          my point was the same as what you made, The middle east was actually much further ahead in the west scientifically after the fall of Rome, a whole lot of lost knowledge was attained during the crusades.

                           And a speculative hypothesis is far from a proven theory.

                          You mean before the fall, right? Rome fell first as a pagan empire then rose and fell again under professing Christians.

                          You stil havent cited your source so Im unwilling to believe your claim. Nothing personal but such a hypothesis  especially in that time period (still before Islam was conceived, mind you) would be more than worthy of note. The point that was being Advanced, is that Islam has kept the Middle East in the dark ages for the last 1500 uears or so. yes, a lot of knowledge was retrieved during the Crusades. That doesnt mean Muslims where advancing science. it just means that a bunch of barbarous fools were sitting on their duffs with the worlds best treasure trove of knowledge right under their feet and all they could do was to make war with other people for no reason. Dont forget that the Crusades were a responce to Islams invasion of not only Israel, but also continental Europe including most of Spain from where they were forcibly ejected because they couldnt live peaceably with anyone nor were they willing to accept Spainish rule. Much like today in nations around the world.

                          The rules that we were guided by in the old testament were savage and applied in a savage manner though much of history There was nothing hypothetical about it we did it and did it well.  Much of the land concurred by man was under the belief that god has written as such and that god was ok with us killing entire populations in his name

                         <p>
                          It was the world expansion that was ultimately the grace that turned us Christians from that which was similar to fundamentalist Islam to where we are now. Christianity changed as smaller groups took its teaching molded them suit their unique needs which is why Christianity is now a vague religion, each of its denominations with different teaching/ethics/morals

                          Your reply confirms you did not attempt to analyze the context of Deuteronomy 13:13-17 and the continued self righteous babel may impress yourself as for me it reaffirms your lack of knowledge in the matter. Satan knows every biblical word and attempted to use it to rationalize Jesus jumping from a cliff. You on the other hand use it to rationalize accusing Christians. Origins of the word Satan is styled the accuser of the brethren (Rev. 12:10. Comp. Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1), as seeking to uphold his influence among men by bringing false charges against Christians. I know who your God is.

                          you chose to ignore our history as Christians and leave all negatives in our history as the act of Satan corrupting man. We can not pick and choice what words in the bible are the words of god and the words of Satan just because we look back and are not proud of our past. we stoned people, paid for women, had slaves, conquered land and mass murdered as it was written

                          My god is a vengeful god, (Nahun 1:2) and your god is not. but somehow we share the same god which brings me back to the point i stated. Christianity is now a vague religion, each of its denominations with different teaching/ethics/morals

                          Are we not talking about the writing of god in relation to his enemies as it relates to conquest? The article talks of Islam writings as the reason for conquest, you stated that Christians do not have those writings &amp; beliefs,  I pointed out they did, you said it was only one passage and it is out of context, i presented that the OT was full of similar items and you retorted with the evil acts of man are the work of the devil.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Same book, same God but we choose what we want to see and teach which is why there are so many christian denominations. I accept the OT &amp; the events that happened (good &amp; bad) as part of our history including Christians laying waste to many opposing religions. You would rather ignore the majority of the OT and focus on the NT were God is much less vengeful and more forgiving.

                          I get it, its ok, we can still both be christian which is why i say Christianity is vague but vague also allows it to be adaptable and allows for its continued expansion

                          No, you claim its the same God. Would you ignore Islams invations and conquering of nations for hundreds of years that resulted in the Christian crusades? How about a reality check for the (PRESENT TIMES) as Islam crucifies Christians and massacres tens of thousands of innocent civilians (NOT MILITARY OF ARMIES)? What are your beliefs on these things currently taking place?

                          P.S. You claim its the same God, I do not believe it for a second. As far as being vague, you say (but vague also allows it to be adaptable and allows for its continued expansion). Maybe but at least they are not so scared of other religions that they fear it being discussed and will not allow other religions books to be read or even owned, What is that? Maybe absolute fear that people will begin to think for themselves or simply a way to beat others into submission so your religion can grow?

                          Which is exactly what vagueness allows.  if we followed our Christian laws as listed and continued with a fundamentalist mindset we would not allow other religions to live period. Because we are vague we have allowed other religions to rise in areas once completely Christian and though we denounce them for it we co-exist

                          Either you are completely clueless as to what the Bible teaches, playing games or intellectually challenged. Which ever the one, obviously its a waste of time speaking with you.  You remind me of a co worker that thinks himself smart with no idea of his ignorance and that many around him are aware of it. Embarrassing.. Im done,

                          Sorry, no cigar. It very clearly states that certain scoundrels among you have led astray the inhabitants to serve other gods whom you have not known It further goes on to read (paraphrased) that if proven true the city and its inhabitants shall be destroyed, periodnot one word about converting.

                          13 some worthless men have gone out from among you and have seduced the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods (whom you have not known), 14 then you shall investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the matter established that this abomination has been done among you, 15 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, [a]utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword. 16 Then you shall gather all its booty into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its booty with fire as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God; and it shall be a [b]ruin forever. It shall never be rebuilt. 17 Nothing from that which is put under the ban shall cling to your hand, in order that the Lord may turn from His burning anger and show mercy to you, and have compassion on you and make you increase, just as He has sworn to your fathers

                          The Quran  has similar references which people list as their desire to convert or kill.  If it is true for the Quran then it is true for the bible.  The Quran does not specifically have passages that say convert just like the bible does not

                          Current day Christianity absolutely does not follow the law of the Old Testament, so its affects on you, us, and everyone else is moot.  Current day Islam follows a single Testament that not only condones terror, but actually requires it.  There again, if you were Christian, or even knew about the basic tenets of Christianity, you would have known something so basic &amp; fundamental.

                          There are many portions of the Old Testament that current day Christianity in america does follows and while the Law is not followed in america it is absolutely followed in other places in the world. For example in modern day Africa Christians are performing a genocide on Muslims, their Christians closely follow the Old Testament and use it as justification for the mass murder.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In the same note, there are many Muslim nations around the world that have lost its Old testament like fundamentals to a point where they drink wine and eat pork just as christian do (if you recall, we did at one point have the same rules). If you actually looked, you would find region stability throughout history has much more of an effect on violence then religion text does. Religion in war is simply a tool to group those who will take faith blindly

                        well to be fair, Islam is the youngest of the three religions, hopefully they wont match the level of destruction the Christians and the Jews had in their early days barring weapons tot he middle east would be a good start.

                          Not meant as a slam on Bill Mahers intelligence.  Hes a smart guy, but against religion in general.  However, he is intellectually honest enough to recognize the clear distinction between muslims and christians as far as violence and rabid ideology.

                      You do know that was 150 years ago? The crusades were in response to Muslim aggression. Slavery has been practiced in every country in the world and not all of them are Christians nor were they ever. Can you name a Christian country that still keeps slaves? No you cannot. Can you show me where in the New Testament it says to kill non believers? No you cant. Yet, Muslims are still doing all of the above today in 2014. Your argument is intellectually dishonest and if you really believe it you need to read a few more books.

                        Slavery is not sanctioned by any nation on this earth, but actually, it is present still, in one form or another, including many muslim nations.  But it exists in numerous Christian countries, too, from Haiti, to Eastern Europe to South America.  And even here.

                        Regardless, your response does not address the point that your religion is no better than the religions you hypocritically criticize.
                        <br/>
                        In the Crusades, the west fought and killed in the name of Christianity, no different from Islam then.  And its in the name of their religion that ISIS, al qaeda and the Taliban kill today.  You and I may be more evolved today in our rich, western, secular society, but there is no moral high ground coming from either religious text.  Both the Bible and Koran sanction war and killing for their faith.  The Bible actually demands it.  (Deut. 13: 6-10).

                        Yes, institutionalized slavery officially ended in the US 150 years ago (though effectively dragged on much longer).  But thats not some point in favor of your faith, as you intimate.  The new morality against slavery didnt come from the Christians in the south.  And it didnt come from the Bible, which sanctions slavery.  It had to be forced by war costing the lives of hundreds of thousands.

                        You distance yourself from the Old Testament as though it isnt part of Christianity.  Yet Jesus, himself, calls out to that Old Testament God you eschewthe same God that calls Lot righteous.  You remember Lot, dont you?  The guy who got drunk and slept with his own daughters. Its the same God that sanctions ethnic cleansing and rape (Numbers 31).
                        <br/>
                        I cant blame you for trying to distance yourself from the OT, but Jesus didnt distance himself from the OT at all (Matthew 5:17).

                        While you want to hide in the pages of the NT, but Ill bet you condemn homosexuality from those OT verses, and ignore the fact that Jesus, himself, says not a word about it.  However, Jesus does come down awfully hard on divorce, but Ill bet you dont have any problem with that.

                          You pick a few verses from the OT in the Pentateuch written in 3000bc, and you compare it to the Quran, which was written in 800ad. Secondly, you assume it is my religion. No, I am just a person who can see through the propaganda. Yes, God dealt with Israel harshly about following other Gods, whom required human sacrifice by the 1000s. If you really want to understand the OT, study the world during the time it was written.

                          If you think war ended slavery, you are mistaken. Abolitionists are what ended slavery, whom the majority were Christians (as well as womens suffrage). They started the ball rolling in every European country including America. The civil war was about states rights and having an organized federal government and one currency. How did that work out? Slavery was a pawn to keep Britain out of the war and from helping the South. Just like gay rights and abortion is today. Our government fights for one thing, control. Just like all governments.
                         </p>

                          Secondly, you assume it is my religion. No, I am just a person who can see through the propaganda that so many fall for repeatedly. I think Christians can stand back and say that they are different than Islam. I have not seen a single Christian blow people up, kidnap and behead someone, or practice female genital mutilation. But, I guess you will give them a free pass on all that in order to have an opportunity to bash Christianity.

                          And if you believe the West, Europe fought in the name of Christianity, you are a fool. They fought in the name of gold and wealth. Please do not confuse Catholicism with Christianity. More Christians died at the hands of Catholicism than Muslims in the crusades.

                          In short, I do not care what my ancestors or Europeans did 1000 years ago or a 150 years ago. Today, I am not in any way desiring to murder people, behead them, or enslave them in order to make them believe how I believe. Islam is. Yes, I am superior to them and more evolved in every way. I desire peace for all men, and only desire for others to show me respect and treat me as I treat them. Unfortunately, not all believe in freedom for all people. Including gays whom you assumed I did not like.

                          The portion of the Bible that speaks about slavery (Ephesians 6:5) should rather be translated employees than slaves if you take into consideration context (which is key). Slavery was a common practice that well benefitted both consenting parties in the time that this was written (of course, there are cases of abuse. There always are) yYet this form of slavery was not at all like the early American form. The former was for a limited time, where the slave was taken care of well and benefited, sheltered, and often times paid. They were to be treated with respect, and on the year of Jubilee all slaves were to be freed just in case there was perversion occurring. Was this passage used to back up Slavery? Yes. Would further learning of the passage bring to light that it was an incorrect usage of the passage? Yes. There is always misunderstanding, as you have a couple in your assertions. It is very common, the Bible is complex and intricate, it is not meant to be fully understood upon the first couple reads.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Again, passages on divorce are not what they appear on surface. Many believe that the Bible doesnt allow for divorce, this is misconception. In Mat. 5, the Hebrew (original) word for Divorce means to send away. Context will show that men had a nasty habit of sending their wives away when the didnt want them anymore without any legal divorce. When women would remarry, they were technically still married to their previous husbands. This was clearly wrong, and so this passage was actually implemented for WOMENS PROTECTION and called for legal process if men wanted to leave their wives. They had to *legally* divorce them (Mat. 5:31-32) as well, and not just send them away. This allowed women to remarry without issue legally or morally.

                         <p>
                          The second hot passage about divorce actually is drawing a conclusion about God based on the CURRENT marriage law. This is not meant to provide a constant rule on how divorce should or should not be, it is meant to make an allusion to something about God. Divorce (and the current law of it) was being used as an example, not being given as a rule. When you see a therefore, remember to ask what the therefore is there for, and it will make Scripture easier to understand and read.

                          The Bible is not an edited, utopian, fictional book. It is a real book of event recording real life, both the good and the bad. What would should learn from and mistakes we should see and avoid. A man sleeping with his daughters showed a story about distrust and how that complicated and hurt lives of those involved. Just because the Bible speaks on something doesnt mean it agrees with it. The Bible had real people, and real people make mistakes.

                          How about some context, friend?  Numbers 31 relates to the Midianites.  Some of the most horrible people that ever existed.  God is not condoning rape in this passage.  Read the book.
                          <br/>
                          As far as Lot goes, yes he got drunk, but if you read the book youll find out that his daughters were behind it so they could have children.  Lot was actually a very righteous man.
                          <br/>
                          Lets keep things in context, shall we?

                          Christians fought the Crusades as a defensive war against Islam, to prevent them from taking over all of Europe. They very nearly did. Read your history bimbo. And nobody follows Deutoronomy 13: 6-10 anymoreneither Christians nor Jews. Get real.

                          The absolute worst religion in the Atheist religion. No other religion has killed more people than them, even combined all the religions of the world can not keep up with the sheer brutality of Atheists.

                          Sorry sir, you are incorrect there. Atheists are not murderous. We just dont need to follow imaginary things. Religions as a whole was used at first to describe the unknown in a way that people at the time could understand. Others that were considered Spiritual Leaders used this in their own favor by turning religion into a Way to control the masses. Think about it, Hel as it is actually spelled is the junk yard / dump out side the cities that all things were burned. So, the story gets blown out of proportion and now it becomes a place to burn for all eternity. Most Holy Men were the worst possible people to walk the earth. Religion is a way to control. With the intelligence that we have now, religion of any kind is unnecessary. I believe in a higher power, it is me and the more I believe in myself the better I am with society. I also live by the main rule we all should live by, Do to others as you want done to you.
                          <br/>
                          Weak minded people follow the invisible God, the strong have no need for it. Oh and the bible, just a bunch of stolen stories and rewritten to fit the needs of the writers, nothing more than a Grimm Fairy Tale as all good books are. As soon as more people understand the sham that organize religion is, the more we will move forward in life. The worst people to trust are the ones that say they are very religions, as they are the ones that walk by the needy with their nose in the air
                          <br/>
                          Also, all of the religions in the world started in the same area of the desert. Time and movement has put the change into effect. Grow up, be productive in society and cheat or harm no one.
                          <br/>
                          Your intelligent Atheist.

                          Hitler didnt personally kill anyone either. The Atheist religious zealots and their God kings and endevours to make heaven on earth makes for the most twisted cult ever. Ungrounded from any moral baseline, they flounder and commit the worlds most horrific atrocities and think they are actually doing good things.

Ungrounded in any moral base line like Christianity they are free to shape the world and people how they see fit and since they hate other people and think the world is too crowded, they take to killing off first those who disagree and then those that cant defend themselves.

                          First point, the crusades. As has already been pointed out they were originally a response by Christianity to attacks made BY Muslims. It was not Christians who Started that war.
                          <br/>
                          Second, part (a) You say that both the Bible and the Quran sanction war and killing for their faith. then you quote Deut. 13: 6-10. which, essentially says, to kill people who try to turn YOU away. In other words If someone is trying to corrupt me I am to do what
                          <br/>
                          I can to prevent it even to the point of killing them BUT, then my point (b) comes into play. When Jesus came to earth he said he came to fulfill the law and the
                          <br/>
                          profits (Matthew 5:17) which means we are no longer bound by the laws and commandments to commit the punishment. All punishment at that point is no longer to be feared because Jesus paid the penalty and God will do the punishing. I still have to do my best but now I do it out of love for God looking to correct my own-self (Matt 7:5). As Paul points out in Romans 6:2 as a Christian I still am obligated to avoid sinful behavior.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Quran tells Muslims to kill any infidel who turns from religion Period. there is no place in the QuRan for forgiveness.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Okay moving on, the next (3rd) point is slavery is condoned by the Bible. Well this is going off topic, how slavery compares to beheading people I do not know. But even though slavery was condoned yes you got that point right, Slaves were suposed to be treated well. And most of the slaves were only in bondage for 7 years. After 7 years there is a year of jubilee the slaves are to be set free even if they still owe. That slavery was focused on people paying off their debt. The other slavery mentioned is not condoned by Christians today and hasnt been for a long time.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4, Minor point here I do not eschew the God of the old testament and I have not met any other Christian who does. BUT, Moving on to the main point, I feel this is a weird place to bring up Lot who was MADE drunk by his daughters so THEY could rape him. But, I believe that part is in the Bible to show that God is and always has been forgiving. Lot, aware of what was going on or not, did these things, but God still forgave and blessed him. This only reinforces how utterly awful things must have been in Sodom and Gomorrah, that God could not forgive them but burned them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Let me see next there is the reference to Numbers 31. Wow a biggie. You say that is God condoning, no SANCTIONING Ethnic cleansing and rape.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Ok lets look at what is really going on there. First this is about Jews killing Midianites. Who were the Midianites? Midian was a son of Abraham by his concubine Keturah. (
                          <a href="http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/M/MIDIAN%3b+MIDIANITES/" rel="nofollow">
                           http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/M/MIDIAN%3b+MIDIANITES/
                          </a>
                          <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10804-midian-and-midianites" rel="nofollow">
                           http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10804-midian-and-midianites
                          </a>
                          ) So the Midianites are cousins of the Jews therefore NOT an ethnic Cleansing, they share ethnicity.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          second this is about revenge. Supported in the Bible where it says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. (Exodus 21:24) BUT WAIT that is Old Testament, what does the NEW testament say? In Matthew 5:38-42 Jesus effectively said, (paraphrasing) That is the old law, as Christians you must forgive and be kind.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Final point You challenged that Jesus does not mention Homosexuality. Actually he has a lot to say about sexual immorality which INCLUDES homosexuality. Mark 10:6, Matthew 5:27, Mark 7:20
                          <br/>
                          As for my not having a problem with divorce, you are VERY wrong. I believe as the Bible says that divorce is not to be condoned EXCEPT for where there is infidelity or abuse.And for you to say otherwise is to assume and judge me like you do not want to be judged. So NOW who is the hypocrite?

                          Most of those slaves, that you speak of were ONLY allowed to go free, IF they converted to Islam, because no Musselman can keep another in bondage.

                          Matthew 5:17 is Jesus saying that the ONLY way to be saved was Himself. Wait for it..  EVEN in the Old Testament. The Law (The Ten Commandments-Exodus 20:3-17) ,given to Moses, is a list of ten descriptors about Jesus.  The Prophets foretold of His coming as Messiah.

                          Yes he said it, but the verse you state is part of a parable he was referring to about  a king.

                        I would like to clarify something for those of you that are saying the crusades were fought to keep Muslims from invading Europe. You are wrong!!!! The following link breaks it down nicwe a nd simple for you. But basically Europe and the Vatican wanted control over Jeruselam and it would be  a chance for Young Nobles to gain lands of their own. Pay close attention to what The Pope promises those who fought against the Muslims!!

                          Claptrap Revisionist bullshit friend, you find ONE post that says what YOU want to hear, and proclaim it as having come down the mountain with moses. Read ALL the information out there, dont go cherry picking ONE revisionist version, and assume that IT is the truth, and everything else is lies.

                          Scott why dont we address the threat to our lives first, instead of jumping up and down screaming YOU HYPOCRITES!.  It makes no sense.  Are Christians trying to behead you right now?  Lets get together on this, focus our efforts against the real threat.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The way I see it, we can sit around debating on whether Christians follow the Old Testament or well be arguing about Christians being hypocrites all the way to our beheading, or we can get together and actually prevent our beheading.

                          Im not intolerant. If Moslems werent running around burning buildings and chopping heads off I wouldnt care what they believed. Im a Catholic but I believe that God will accept you if you have adhered in the faith you were raised in. Unless of course, you murder for it.

                          What I dont understand is, if countries that are predominantlyIslamic the Moslems study only the Koran, how can they give us so much trouble? Why cant we stop selling them arms and training them how to use them? In the Middle Ages the Moslems lost even the knowledge of how to use the wheel. So why are we afraid to fight them now? They lost to Jefferson. They lost in World War One. They were sympathetic to Hitler in World War Two. All we have to do is buckle down and fight them!

                        England was Catholic in the middle ages, dummy. And the Pope was asked to help the Eastern Church in Constantinople because Islam was taking over the whole Middle East. And North Africa. Christianity started in Israel. It spread first to the Middle East. St. Mark converted Egypt and St. Thomas made it to India. Mohammed wasnt even AROUND until 600 AD. They made it all the way to the gates of Vienna (September 11!) and they were in France when the Crusades began.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I might add that they were as intolerant then as they are now. We fought the Crusades to control the rise of Islam and to defend ourselves.

                      The papacy is different than Christianity.  Why do you think we had the religious wars?  To get access to the Bible, to stand up for what Jesus actually says.

                      The inquisition was done by the catholic church and they even persecuted and killed Christians that believed in Jesus Christ ! Against popular belief Catholics are not true Christians they are a popular cult-religion!

                      Muslims are STILL doing these things in Africa every day. Tens of Thousands are killed, enslaved,mutilated, raped, and dismembered.  The devil can pervert even the best institutions like organized religion. The crusades were in responce to the Muslims attacking, raping, and killing of European citizens.     The Bible does not, has not, and will not ever speak the EVIL that the Quaran does. Nor does the Bible make reference to those that kill in its name, or specify paradise for soldiers?  Islam is the scourge of the world. Equating 15th century Christians to Muslims is ridiculous. Muslims are doing now what they did Hundred of years ago and it is pure unadulterated EVIL. The enemy of my enemy is NOT your friend. Wake Up

                    The crusades were in retaliation to muslims invading Europe as well. The Arab and other muslim writings of that period make multiple references to it.

                        College kids? Elementary kids are now being told Islam founded America. Its absolutely nuts how weve let the rabid left run this country into the ground by teaching this bullshit! Islam is a terror cult!

                          Islam founded America  in a way, its true. If the muslim terrorists of the day hadnt been threatening and hampering the Silk Road trade routes, the queen of Spain would never have had much incentive to pay for Columbus attempt to find an alternative way to India  and history may have been quite different.

Further if not for a 1655 law suit by Anthony Johnson who records show was from Angola, slavery would not have expanded to the degree to which it was. Johnson a black property owner was in a dispute with his neighbor Robert Parker over the fate of an individual named John Casor. Prior to then all people had been indentured and could earn their freedom.

                          that depends on how you look at it if they had not captured Anthony Jackson and sent him to the United States he could not have filed the lawsuit that led to life time servitude then no slavery. Of course slavery was only one issue in the Civil War. Bad blood had been brewing for 50 years.It was as much about states rights and taxes as anything else. If the hot heads in Charleston, South Carolina had waited things might have been settled without a fight.

                          Jasper, the Queen of Spain gave money to Christopher Columbus to find a new land because Spain was expelling ALL JEWS at the time.  Muslims had nothing to do with it.  It was a JEW who helped America get on her feet.  Read up on that!  Go to WallBuilders.com and ask David Barton.  You will not find a more clear cut look at America than through David Barton, and he has the documents (original) to back up what he says!

                          I hope you read about Islam first before slamming it as a terror cult. You have American muslims. Islam learnt us the real coexistence and averted us from sectarianism. Youre racist. Racism never build good human relationships. Build the gap among different civilization will be more beneficial and constructing.

                          Dont remember the Christian Kill everyone stage you are talking about. Just because someone claims to be a christian doesnt make them one. Liberals like to leave out big chunks of why things happened, Just like this story explains why they finally decided to go attack and defend our country. Liberals like to leave out the reason so they can make it look like a one sided war where we just attacked a bunch of innocent bystanders. Liberals protect evil every chance they get.

                          Each of the acts you have posted were committed by monarchies or the Holy Roman Empire. Not one of those reflect Christ at all. Jesus never told His followers to kill the unbelievers, which is what Mohammed instructs his followers to do. Christ does not instruct His followers to extort protection money from Jews if they do not convert, but Islam does. Christ did not condone beheading, and He taught mercy and grace and forgiveness. Islam does not worship the same God as Christians do. Allah does not equal the God of the Jews and the Christians:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          1.) Moon worship has been practiced in Arabia since 2000 BC. The
                          <br/>
                          crescent moon is the most common symbol of this pagan moon worship as
                          <br/>
                          far back as 2000 BC.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          2.) In Mecca, there was a god named Hubal who was Lord of the Kabah.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          3.) This Hubal was a moon god.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4.) One Muslim apologist confessed that the idol of moon god Hubal was
                          <br/>
                          placed upon the roof of the Kaba about 400 years before Muhammad. This
                          <br/>
                          may in fact be the origin of why the crescent moon is on top of every
                          <br/>
                          minaret at the Kaba today and the central symbol of Islam atop of every
                          <br/>
                          mosque throughout the world:
                          <br/>
                          About four hundred years before the birth of Muhammad one Amr bin Lahyo  a descendant of Qahtan and king of Hijaz, had put an idol called Hubal on the roof of the Kaba. This was one of the chief deities of the Quraish before Islam. (Muhammad The Holy Prophet, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar (Pakistan), p 18-19, Muslim)
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          5.) The moon god was also referred to as al-ilah. This is not a proper
                          <br/>
                          name of a single specific god, but a generic reference meaning the
                          <br/>
                          god. Each local pagan Arab tribe would refer to their own local tribal
                          <br/>
                          pagan god as al-ilah.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          6.) al-ilah was later shortened to Allah before Muhammad began promoting his new religion in 610 AD.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          7.) There is evidence that Hubal was referred to as Allah.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          8.) When Muhammad came along, he dropped all references to the name Hubal but retained the generic Allah.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          9.) Muhammad retained almost all the pagan rituals of the Arabs at the Kaba and redefined them in monotheistic terms.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          10.) Regardless of the specifics of the facts, it is clear that Islam is derived from paganism that once worshiped a moon-god.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          11.) Although Islam is today a monotheist religion, its roots are in paganism.
                          <br/>
                          Mohammed was not a descendent of Ishmael. Here are ten historical facts that prove the Quran is wrong:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          1.) According to the Torah, when Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees, he
                          <br/>
                          went West to what is now called Israel (Gen. 12 ff.). He became a
                          <br/>
                          dweller in tents in that land. It was in Israel that God made a covenant
                          <br/>
                          with him for the land in which he was living at that time. It was in
                          <br/>
                          Israel that he fathered Isaac, Ishmael, and many other sons and
                          <br/>
                          daughters. Isaac was the only son of Abraham chosen by God to be the
                          <br/>
                          heir of the covenant. Abraham took Isaac to Mt. Moriah to be offered up
                          <br/>
                          as a sacrifice to God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          2.) The Torah is contradicted by Quran at nearly every point. According
                          <br/>
                          to Surah 2:119-121, Abraham and Ishmael did not dwell in tents in
                          <br/>
                          Israel but in the city of Mecca in Arabia. Together they rebuilt the
                          <br/>
                          Kabah and placed the black stone in the wall. It was Abraham who started
                          <br/>
                          the tradition of an annual pilgrimage to Mecca, throwing stones at the
                          <br/>
                          devil, etc. Abraham took Ishmael (not Isaac) to nearby Mt. Mina to offer
                          <br/>
                          as a sacrifice to God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          3.) Ishmaels twelve sons were named Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
                          <br/>
                          Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. (Gen.
                          <br/>
                          12:11-16) They intermarried with the local population in North Arabia
                          <br/>
                          and produced several nomadic tribes know as the Ishmaelites.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4.) It was prophesied in the Torah that Ishmael and his family would
                          <br/>
                          live to the East of all his brothers. (Gen. 16:12) And they settled
                          <br/>
                          from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria.

                          (Gen 25:18) This broad area is the desert section East of Egypt in
                          <br/>
                          Northern Arabia toward the kingdom of the Assyrians.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          5.) The Ishmaelites are mentioned as a distinct tribe in the Assyrian
                          <br/>
                          records. They later intermarried with and were absorbed by the
                          <br/>
                          Midianites and other local tribes. In Gen. 37:25-28; 39:1, the
                          <br/>
                          Ishmaelites are called the Midianites and in Judges 8:22-24 cf. 7:1f,
                          <br/>
                          the Midianites are called the Ishmaelites. The identification cannot be
                          <br/>
                          made any stronger.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          6.) Arabia was already populated by the descendants of Cush and Shem
                          <br/>
                          long before Abraham or Ishmael were born (Gen. 10:7). Their cities and
                          <br/>
                          temples have been well documented by archeologists.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          7.) If all the Arab people descended from Ishmael as Muhammad claimed,
                          <br/>
                          where did all the original Arabs go? What happened to them? Who did
                          <br/>
                          Ishmael marry if the Arabs did not already exist? If Arabia was
                          <br/>
                          unpopulated, who built Mecca? Since he lived there, obviously it existed
                          <br/>
                          before he was born. The facts speak for themselves. The Arab people
                          <br/>
                          existed before, during, and after Ishmael moved started roaming the
                          <br/>
                          wilderness of North Arabia.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          8.) The descendants of Ishmael were scattered in Northern Arabia from
                          <br/>
                          the wilderness of Shur to the ancient city of Havilah. They were
                          <br/>
                          absorbed by the local tribes such as the Midianites (Gen. 37:25-28;
                          <br/>
                          39:1; Judges 8:24). There is no historical or archeological evidence
                          <br/>
                          that Ishmael went south to Mecca and became the Father of the Arab
                          <br/>
                          race. Some modern Arab scholars admit that before Muhammad, Qahtan was
                          <br/>
                          said to be the Father of the Arab people, not Ishmael.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          9.) The Abrahamic Covenant was given only to Isaac and to his
                          <br/>
                          descendants. Ishmael and the other sons of Abraham were explicitly
                          <br/>
                          excluded by God from having any part of the covenant made with Abraham.
                          <br/>
                          (Gen. 18:18-21)
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          10.) Therefore the descendants of Ishmael and the other sons of Abraham
                          <br/>
                          do not have any claim to the land of Israel because they are not
                          <br/>
                          included in the covenant God made with Abraham. Only the Jews have any
                          <br/>
                          claim to the land of Israel.
                          <br/>
                          Finally, Christianity and Islam are not alike at all, and to say that means you know nothing of Christ, the new Testament, or the OLD Testament whatsoever.  Jesus Christ is the True God, the manifestation of the Word of God. Allah is a pagan moon deity.

                          Christianity wasnt Sorry! Christ didnt proclaim the gospel of stoning.  Anyone who murders in the name of Christ isnt a Christian. Just because they say they are, doesnt make it so.

                          such a despised and base race, which worships demons, should conquer a

                        lol, I actually had a professor that explained it as the European countries had more or less stopped waging constant war on each other and had all these Knights, who were little more than thuggish mercenaries, that they had nothing to do with and were causing problems by roughing up villages and women, so they waged the Crusades to give them something to fight away from Europe.

                        I am currently in college studying history. Luckily 14 or so years ago when I was still in high school I was so interested in history that I took it upon myself to study every aspect of it. In one of my history classes last semester we learned that Spain and parts of Italy were homes to many Muslims before and after the fall of the Western Roman empire and that the cruel Franks ran them out. I made many comments during this class that it was the duty of the Franks to run the invaders out and that there was no concrete proof that the Romans even allowed them into their empire for anything beyond trade.

                          One problem with what you said the western roman empire was toast before islam even existed.  Nice try though maybe you should stop reading revisionist history books.  Anything written before 1990 is suspect when it comes to history.

                      Keep lying until you believe yourself. Crusades were the most major movements of colonisation in the world. Such bloody inhumane waves of invasions would never launch except by blind bad people. Read about muslims before you speak about them. This is fair

                        Read about muslims? How about fighting with and against them? Working with them and discussing culture and religion with them? Been there, done (and still) doing that. When you say Muslims, what, pray tell, Muslims are you speaking of? As for lying, thats your bag, not mine. As for colonization. The crusades were in response to a force who came in and colonized an area who already had people there.  Things go both ways.  GOD bless America. Have a nice, peaceful day.

                          Seemingly you speak as if you were totally ignorant of the fact how has America been existed. Millions from the indigenous inhabitants have been brutally slaughtered in order to get America there. What about western colonial aspirations against the Muslim countries, have you heard about the French expedition against North African countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt with the main objective of changing their Islamic identity. How many have been brutally slaughtered in Algeria at the hand of the colonialists, millions Sir. What about what America is currently doing in Afghanistan, Iraq and their blatant intervention in other countries in the region. Please be neutral. I understand your bias to America, it is normal by the way, I cant blame you for that. However, never look at it from a sole prospective.

                        I have read about Islam Sherif. I did to try and understand why so many die at the hands of muslims. I find in the books so many answers to those questions I had and I do understand the whys now. I also understand from history why the killing has not stopped. It is written in the books as a just thing to do.  I do understand.

                    Youll come to find that a lot of world history was warped in such a way that it favors Islam.  They blamed Europeans for destroying the Roman Empire; but, it was actually continuous Muslim invasions that lead to the dark ages in Europe.  The constant war and the destruction of all literature was a result of Islam purging the world of anything that wasnt the Quran.  There were massive libraries throughout the ancient world, that contained information going back thousands of years; but, it was all burned.  They dedicated centuries to conquering and enslaving as much of the world as possible; it is no surprise that most people in the world react instinctively with repulsion to Islam.  Apologists tried to pander to their oppressors by making it sound like the world would have ended had it not been for the Muslims and their golden age; but, they ignore the reality that the golden age of Islam revolve completely around violent conquest and enslavement.

                    Have you ever read the Quran, dead sure no. You say that Qurans commandments to its followers to kill anyone in their way. Please neutrally read the meaning of the verse: whosoever killed a soul without good reason, he has now killed the whole creatures, and whosoever kept it alive, he has now kept alive the whole creatures. This is the Quran. Killing people in Europe and USA was motivated by the western Irredentism and greed, the capitalism. Islam calls love, coexistence and rationalism. Please dont go blindly after biased incitements from people who dont know love or charity.

                    In the 60s  the liberals decided that the blacks and arabs should rule their own countries. They nationalized the oil and kicked out the oil companies that developed the wells. As you can tell self rule is working so well. Genocide and slavery are alive and well.

                  This is sickening. Can you really take actions taken hundreds of years ago with completely different circumstances, people, ideas, and ethics and use them to convince a wide number of people that its the same? Because its not. So much has happened in the last hundred years even that changes the game drastically. Wars, revolutions, regime changes, economic changes, ideological changes, have all evolved the situation we are dealing with now to something far more complex than the vast majority of people have the ability/ambition to understand. So instead, they group people into false but easy to identify groups and place vague, thoughtless labels on that group without even asking its members if they agree. Yes, we can, and absolutely should, learn from our history. But its not okay to simply use history to support your own opinion in blatant disregard of the facts.

                 <p>
                  And to lump the whole religion of Islam into a group because of a small sect of people is the type of overgeneralizing and stereotyping that has led to millions, if not billions, of people being slaughtered. Islam can be a beautiful thing. It can be an ugly thing. But so can just about any other religion in the world. Dont be so quick to point fingers at the lump sum because its easier than identifying and discerning the extremists from the rest of the Islamic population.

                  Furthermore, its high timr to grow up, get some real facts, and post content that is actually informative instead of just copied and pasted. Form your own thought, write your own article. And while youre at it, check out some videos on this subject by Reza Aslan  hes wonderfully logical and reasonable.

                  I used to love this site, but the hateful and simply untrue things that are posted and passed off as some kind of journalism are too much for me. Most of these posts are garbage that are copied and pasted from other sources. And frankly, they mark the lack of openmindedness and consideration the Republican party has been plagued by for the last 20 years. So congrats for towing the party line, I guess. Dont be shocked when the younger generations, who tend to be far more open minded than their parents or grandparents generations, dont turn out to support the cause.

                    You obviously know nothing regarding the history of Islam in the last 300 years let alone 1400 years, so its no surprise you cant connect the dots when it comes to the history and significance of the events of the last 40 years or even 4. Islam has killed 270m people on its own. The crusades were a response to muslim expansionism. IF you removed islam from the world, its a pretty peaceful place. I suggest you want Political Islam which you can find on youtube.

                  There are other things Obama could learn from TJ:  Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people  [blacks] are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot  live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of  distinction between them.

                  and:  Jefferson made provision for the case of a white woman who might bear a mulatto child. Both the mother and her child were to leave Virginia, immediately after the birth. In the event of their failure to do so, mother and child were declared to be beyond the protection of the law.

                  Cool, now lets have a look at the closing of this war to see what Jefferson and the US Congress had to actually say:  As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense,
                  <br/>
                  founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of
                  <br/>
                  enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen ; and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan  nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from
                  <br/>
                  religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony
                  <br/>
                  existing between the two countries

                      WW I, the ottoman empire, the middle east was carved into its current parts (mostly) as a n attempt to keep the peace and prevent the muslims from uniting ever again.   The treaty of Versailles divided up the region into sprees of influence.  Many things in the last 40 years has changed the influences, in Iran, Egypt, Turkey, most notably.

                  The Moslems have been at war with us since about 600 AD. Do you really think the Crusadees were about some Westerners wanting to colonize the Middle East? Where do you think Christianity started in the first place? They got all the way to Vienna before we stopped them from taking over Europebut just remember, there were Christians all through North Africa up to Constanoplenow Istanbul. All those mosques used to be Christian Churches at one time. And theres still Christians in places like Lebanon and Egypt.

                  While the majority of Muslims are peaceful people, the ideology of Islam is violent and evil, totally incompatible with core Judeo/Christian values of freedom and loving your neighbor. Jefferson understood this clearly.

                  The Islamists have a massive inferiority complex and have hated the rest of humanity for centuries; they will enslave or kill us all, given the chance. America has to decide whether we will fight and survive, or eventually see our cities vaporized in mushroom clouds courtesy of suitcase bombs from our friends in Tehran.

                  It is sad that that culture can not adapt to civilized society, unfortunately, the only way to end the hate and destruction these people bring is to wipe out their faith once and for all. Unless that happens, we will continue to fight an unending war against these people who can not adapt to the present day and continue to violate the rights of both women and who the call Infidels.

                  To even provide further proof of what Jefferson felt about islam, in the last paragraph of the quran he had printed as a warning to Americans: They fear to utter things that may displease their false prophet. Most of their doctors affirm those letter to be of the names of God. Thou shalt find the exposition in this version. Thou will wonder that such ABSURDITIES have INFECTED the best part of the world, that the knowledge of what is contained in this book, will render that law CONTEMPTIBLE.

                  Can
                  <br/>
                  a good Muslim be a good American?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That question was forwarded to a person that worked in Saudi Arabia for 20
                  <br/>
                  years.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The following is his forwarded reply:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Theologically  no. Because his allegiance is to Allah, the moon God of Arabia.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Religiously  no. Because no other religion is accepted by his Allah except
                  <br/>
                  Islam (Quran, 2:256)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Scripturally  no. Because his allegiance is to the five pillars of Islam and
                  <br/>
                  the Quran (Koran).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Geographically  no. Because his allegiance is to Mecca, to which he turns in
                  <br/>
                  prayer five times a day.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Socially  no. Because his allegiance to Islam forbids him to make friends with
                  <br/>
                  Christians or Jews. (Quran 5:51)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Politically  no. Because he must submit to the mullah (spiritual leaders), who
                  <br/>
                  teach annihilation of Israel and Destruction of America, the great Satan.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Domestically  no. Because he is instructed to marry four women and beat and
                  <br/>
                  scourge his wife when she disobeys him (Quran 4:34).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Intellectually  no. Because he cannot accept the American Constitution since
                  <br/>
                  it is based on Biblical principles and he believes the Bible to be corrupt.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Philosophically  no. Because Islam, Muhammad, and the Quran do not allow
                  <br/>
                  freedom of religion and expression. Democracy and Islam cannot co-exist. Every
                  <br/>
                  Muslim government is either dictatorial or autocratic.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Spiritually  no. Because when we declare one nation under God, the
                  <br/>
                  Christians God is loving and kind, while Allah is NEVER referred to as
                  <br/>
                  heavenly father, nor is he ever called love in The Qurans 99 excellent names.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Therefore after much study and deliberation.perhaps we should be very
                  <br/>
                  suspicious of ALL MUSLIMS in this country. They obviously cannot be both
                  <br/>
                  good Muslims and good Americans. Call it what you wish.its
                  <br/>
                  still the truth.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You had better believe it.

                  When the USS Bainbridge was sent to free the Maersk Alabama from Muslim pirates, I wondered if someone at the Pentagon was sending a message.  Since the capture of Commodore Bainbridge and USS Philadelphia in 1805 was a turning point in the Barbary Wars against the Muslims.

                  Islam
                  <br/>
                  is not a religion; it is a cult of violence, abuse, oppression and intolerance.
                  <br/>
                  By the words of the Koran, mohammed was a thief, a bloodthirsty murderer, a
                  <br/>
                  rapist and a child molester. To me, this does not sound like a prophet of any
                  <br/>
                  godlike entity but more like a lunatic psychopath. allah is nothing more than a
                  <br/>
                  cartoon character mohammed hallucinated to become the embodiment of the voices in his head screaming at him. The only reason he has followers claiming he was a prophet of God is that they secretly hope to get away with the same crimes while hiding behind women, children and the faade of a phony religion. Sharia law should be banned in all U.S. states and territories and the practice of
                  <br/>
                  sharia law should be made a criminal offense with serious penalties. U.S.
                  <br/>
                  foreign aid should be prohibited to any country allowing the practice of sharia
                  <br/>
                  law.

                  I had never read or studied such a story in our Arabian history. But what I am sure of is that on the year 1801 all Arab countries were under the lead of Turkey . Egypt was under occupation of the French since 1798 : 1801 . Tripoli was just a very small part of the Turkish Empire.I cannot imagine that it can or has that power. How could it be ? Tripoli has never ever had a navy or even a separate army. It was just a small town under the flag of Turkey. It never played any rule in the Islamic history, or even has an ambassador  to Britain. This is completely a false story.

This seams to be completely a false story.What is written in the Wikipedia in Arabic is new to me. It is about some money to be paid to the leader of this very small town in order to protect foreign ships in the area from the piracy.This is not a history , it is just like what is happening now in Somalia . Of course it has nothing to do with Islam. Why do they always stick any bad thing to Islam?? As I told you my brother , Evil is dividing to rule .. Every body should hate every body..

                  I agree with everything you say 100%. But referencing Wikipedia!? Come on now. You can find that information in a reputable source. Even high school kids no you cant source Wikipedia. Also, The Barbary Coast Wars are where the nickname for USMC Leathernecks comes from. They wore high leather collars becausebelieve it or notthe Muslims liked trying to cut off their opponents heads. The leather collars prevented the Marines from injury while they stabbed the Muslims in the heart! Uh Ah!

                  The Ambassador answered us that it was founded on the Laws of their prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every musselman [muslim] who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise.

                  This statement was a part of a March 28, 1786, letter from John Adams and Thomas Jefferson to John Jay, the United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Continental Congress, concerning their conversation with Tripolis to London, Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman as to why his pirates/terrorists hijacked our merchant ships, stole the ships and cargo while holding the sailors for ransom.

                  Thats also where the fighting leathernecks came from due to men wearing thick leather around their necks so as to not let the muslims chop off their heads.

                  Islam is NOT a religion. It is an imperialistic political philosophy with theological aspects used to justify its barbarity and atrocities. It should be thought of as just the kind of  .  Insanity and extremism that it is.

                  And the Quran that Thomas Jefferson used to study why a supposed holy book was being used to enslave and mistreat Americans was resurrected from His Library to swear in Congressmen (Ellison) and CIA Director Brennan,  The Controversy concerning Brennan is that he took the oath of Office on the Quran and the Constitution without the Bill of Rights included

                  .  Interestingly the Quran recognizes no other Government Law but Sharia Law and no other Constitution but its own and no other Country, Nation, or Peoples is recognized except those under the Islamic rule.  Wherever they build a Mosque, in whatever land they come into, that Country and land is considered conquered by Islam.  This would explain why there is no traditional adherence to the American way of Governing.

                  Ummm this is leaving out a lot of history to put forth its own agenda.  What about the treaty of Tripoli?specifically article 11 of that treatyand what about the later peace treaty?

                  Why dont they include the original treaty of tripoli?  Gigantic oversight, I guess because it obliterates the authors (cough cough) point.  You got google, foogles.

                  Ive often thought that someone should make a Barbary Wars movie. They had one ship that got caught in mud during low tide and they were fighting the Muslims right there. I just think more Americans need to knwo about this war as most people know nothing about it.

                  When Christians return to their original teachings peace abounds. When Muslims return to their original teachings, people are abused and killed. History shows it to be so. They wish to rule the world and force everyone to say they are Muslims.

                  In 1797, France was run by a group of 5 men known as The Directory. The
                  <br/>
                  American reaction was in response to a demand that the United States
                  <br/>
                  would have to pay the five members of The Directory $50,000 each and pay
                  <br/>
                  tribute to France in the form of a $10,000,000 loan. The French were
                  <br/>
                  mad about a treaty we made with England and they wanted the bribe to
                  <br/>
                  stop their attacks on our shipping.

                  Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute, was actually made

                  We badly need some real American leadership. I dont know if there are any good men left who actually care about the country, but this is the last chance we are going to get to get it right. We need a real hawk in the white house or we are gonzo.

                  Worth repeating:  See? It has nothing to do with oil or The U.S. occupying arab lands. The Islamists just use these excuses because they really have no other reason to use than The quran told us so.

                  Islam and Christianity are very very similar in text the major differences can as Christianity splintered and gave up its fundamentalist views. One day Islam will do the same as it seems the path of all religions.

                  Jesus taught his followers to pray for unbelievers, Mohammad taught his to behead them There is a big difference! Muslims have been gaining in numbers and territory by torturing and killing unbelievers since the 7th century until the Ottoman empire was broken up after WWI in 1924. They enslaved and raped captive women and children during their rein of terror. They tried to invade Europe many times but were pushed back by Christians and the Crusades. Unless we know history we are fooled into believing terrorism is something new to Islam because of the terrible things the United States is doing or because  Israel was made into a nation after WWII. The truth is terrorist are following the teachings of the Quran just like they always have. Moderate Muslims are just the ones that dont take the violent verses in the Quran, Hadith and Sharia law literally, the radical Muslims do. Islam seeks the establishment of Sharia law that calls for the submission and or death of unbelievers. Our constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Sharia law is, of its own nature, unconstitutional and can not be permitted in order to protect the very freedom of religion it seeks to destroy. The other problem with Islam is it isnt just a religion, it is also a form of government that seeks to replace other forms of governments.

                  I was taught in school that the Crusades were wars waged against the Muslims to force them to convert to Catholicism.  I grew up critical of the Catholic church. Some 20 years later I was reading and it was vastly different from what I had been taught about the Crusades.  I when on to research it and learned I had been believing a lie most of my life.  From there I challenged everything I had been taught and found most of it was also a lie.  I was lucky I think most folks never have that revelation, which is why the Democrat party and radical Muslim terrorist exists as they do today.

                  You tell people lies. You hold the material and moral responsibility for such fabrications which never serve except the evil. Dead sure youve never read the true history. If you try you can know the truth, however Im confident you want to believe in order to nurture your tendency of violence and chaos. Youre the loser at last, believe me

                  I watched, and heard, the POTUS tell Bill OReilly in an interview that he never looks at the past he just keeps going forward.  So telling him to look to the countrys history has no part in how he acts.  Thats probably why he has so little regard for the Constitution.

                  I was aware that in large part, the U.S. Navy was built and first deployed overseas specifically to fight the Islamic states of Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis.  The campaign in the Mediterranean produced some of our finest early naval victories and heroes.  Even then, the Europeans found it more expedient to just pay the tribute.
