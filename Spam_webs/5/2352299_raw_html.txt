        Hardware performance is constantly improving, and it's only natural to want the best, so we upgrade our system from time to time and leave the old ones behind, considering them obsolete. But you don't usually need the latest and greatest - it was only a few years ago that people were running perfectly usable systems on 500MHz CPUs and drooling over the prospect that a 1GHz CPU might actually be available quite soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can imagine someone writing a similar article, ten years from now, about what to do with that slow, old 4GHz eight-core system that is now gathering dust. That's what we aim to do here: show you how you can put that old hardware to good use instead of consigning it to the scrapheap.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what are we talking about when we say older computers? The sort of spec that was popular around the turn of the century. OK, while that may be true, it does make it seem like we are talking about really old hardware. A typical entry-level machine from six or seven years ago would have had something like an 800MHz processor, Pentium 3 or similar, 128MB of RAM and a 20-30GB hard disk.
       </p>
       <p>
        The test rig used for testing most of the software we will discuss is actually slightly lower spec, it has a 700MHz Celeron processor, because that's what I found in the pile of computer gear I never throw away in my loft, right next to my faithful old - but non-functioning - Amiga 4000.
       </p>
       <p>
        We set the base spec at 128MB of RAM (because that is what machines of this type were typically supplied with), but adding more can provide a substantial performance boost. In fact, doubling the RAM to 256MB would give a greater benefit than a faster CPU, at far less cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very few people buy such small amounts of RAM these days, so they can be found at bargain prices. I needed 128MB for the test machine (it already had 256MB) and bought two brand new 64MB sticks of IBM memory for 0.99 on eBay. Where relevant, we will also cover software alternatives that will work on lesser hardware.
       </p>
       <p>
        Smaller distros have fewer graphical tools, so you will have to use the command line at times, but it is all very straightforward. One of the great things about using an old machine for this is that you can experiment to your heart's content, and if you make a total hash of things you can just reinstall and start again without messing up your main computer with years of carefully collected data.
       </p>

        <h2>
         Older and slower hardware?
        </h2>
        <p>
         We're going to be looking at using a PC in the 500-800MHz range with 128MB of RAM, but what if you are using something much more limited. We are not going to get into 386 dinosaur territory here, but there are plenty of old desktops and laptops floating around with 200-300MHz processors and 64MB of RAM.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are too limited for even the Xfce desktop of Vector Linux but there are other options. There are also lighter Windows managers, in descending order of size, you could try IceWM, Fluxbox or Ratpoison (which will run on anything with more memory than a goldfish).
        </p>
        <p>
         Damn Small Linux and Puppy Linux will run a graphical desktop on a box with as little as 32MB and are one way to get more use out of such hardware, but you may be better off considering something more specialised than desktop use. This sort of hardware is fine for running a basic file server or a low usage web or mail server, but excellent for use as an Internet gateway.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, an old desktop computer is bigger and noisier than a Netgear or Linksys router, and it has less blinkenlights, but it is also far more capable and flexible when running a dedicated distro like SmoothWall or IPCop. Install one of these on the box, disconnect the keyboard and monitor and shove it in a cupboard. All configuration is done via a web browser, you don't need physical access to it once it is installed.
        </p>
        <p>
         What do you do if your system is so old it doesn't have a CD-ROM, or has one but cannot boot from it. In the latter case, Smart Boot Manager can be copied to a floppy disk. Boot from this and then select the CD-ROM from the menu to transfer the boot process to the CD.
        </p>
        <p align="CENTER">
         <!--DFP MPU -->

        <div id="dfp-advert-2">
         <script>
          googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('dfp-advert-2')});
         </script>
        </div>
        <p>
         Installing with no CD-ROM is less easy. Any computer old enough to have no option drive is unlikely to have USB either (particularly bootable USB) or PXE net booting, so you are stuck with one of the minimal floppy-based distros or looking for one that can d a network install from a floppy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Debian is one choice for this, with details at
         <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst">
          www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
         </a>
         . Provided the floppy disk is able to bring up your network the rest of the installation should proceed as normal, albeit somewhat slower. There's also an interesting looking method of doing this without even a floppy disk at
         <a href="http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html">
          http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html
         </a>
         , although we haven't tried it.
        </p>
       </div>
       <h2>
        What can you do with an older PC?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Anything was considered the domain of a powerful system a few years ago. We were quite happy using 500MHz to 1GHz computers for web browsing, email, work processing and even gaming. While the demands of gaming have moved on, the others don't require any more power than they used to, though some of the programs are now too heavyweight for the 128MB of memory that was considered plentiful in those days.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, we will look at setting up a general purpose desktop system suitable for use on limited hardware; from choosing a suitable distro through installing it, to selecting suitable apps for the main tasks. Later we look at some of the more specialist uses for older hardware, for those of you that don't need yet another desktop computer and are quite happy with your quad-core CPU system for writing emails.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Pick a distro
       </h2>
       <p>
        Ask about a lightweight distro anywhere and it will not be long before someone mentions Damn Small Linux (DSL). Well, we have mentioned it now, but we are not going to use it. DSL does a fine job of cramming a lot onto a 50MB CD, but this limit imposes some artificial restraints, such as the requirement for a 2.4 series kernel.
       </p>
       <p>
        We don't care how big the install CD is, as long as the system installs easily and runs well on our hardware. A 2.6 kernel is a requirement, because some hardware only works with newer kernels. This isn't a problem with the basic hardware, after all, it is older than 2.4, but what if you want to connect something like a webcam that has drivers that only work with the 2.6 kernels.
       </p>
       <p>
        How about the convenience of automatically mounting USB flash disks, CDs and digital cameras? Do you really want to go back to the hit-and-miss, will-it-won't-it excitement of supermount? Puppy Linux was also considered but was similarly lightweight, either of these would be suitable for less capable hardware.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also looked as Xubuntu, a variant of Ubuntu using the same Xfce desktop as Vector, but its memory requirements were higher. Xubuntu is definitely worth a look if you have 256MB of memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        After looking at the options, we picked on Vector Linux (
        <a href="http://www.vectorlinux.com">
         www.vectorlinux.com
        </a>
        ), a Slackware derivative that is ideal for those with less well-endowed hardware, with the website stating it is "specifically designed for use on older computers with slower processors and less RAM".
       </p>
       <p>
        There are different versions of Vector available, we used the Standard edition for this, but there is also a SOHO release. Both are at version 5.8, with a release candidate of the 5.9 standard version also available at the time of writing. The SOHO release uses a KDE desktop and includes OpenOffice.org, both of which are somewhat heavyweight for our old box, and the combination could bring it to its knees.
       </p>
       <div class="image">
        <img alt="Boot from the CD to start the basic-looking, but easy to use, Vector Linux installer." src="/files/LXF102.resurrect.01start.jpg"/>
        <p>
         Boot from the CD to start the basic-looking, but easy to use, Vector Linux installer.
        </p>
       </div>
       <p>
        The standard edition has a minimum requirement of a P200 and 96MB or RAM, making it ideal for our test system. We use the 5.9 release candidate, although a final release may be out by the time you read this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vector Standard edition uses the Xfce desktop, together with the highly-rated Thunar file manager and a complete suite of applications. Not all of the names may be familiar to you, some of the applications are alternatives to the more resource hungry programs you already know and use, but for this environment, they are perfect. See the Diet Software box below for some lighter alternatives to the usual suspects.
       </p>
       <div class="boxout">
        <h2>
         Diet software
        </h2>
        <p>
         While the likes of OpenOffice.org and Gnome are highly capable, they do work best with plenty of RAM and a good helping of CPU cycles. Here we list lighter, but still very capable, alternatives to some of the programs you are more familiar with. All of these provide the main features of their better known brethren, but are more suited to older hardware.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           OpenOffice.org:
          </strong>
          AbiWord for word processing, Gnumeric for spreadsheets
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           KDE or Gnome:
          </strong>
          Xfce and the Thunar file manager, IceWM and the ROX file manager
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Firefox or Konqueror:
          </strong>
          Dillo
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           K3b:
          </strong>
          Xfburn
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Evolution or KMail:
          </strong>
          Claws Mail or Sylpheed
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         It is a sign of what people want from their browsers, or how much work is involved in creating a good one, that there is very little in the middle ground between Dillo and Firefox/Konqueror. Some of the apparently lighter browsers, like Galeon and Epiphany, require several Gnome libraries and packages, making them not-so-lightweight on a non-Gnome system.
        </p>

       <h2>
        Installation
       </h2>
       <p>
        Download an ISO of Vector Linux then burn it to a CD-R in the usual way then boot from it to install. This is very much like installing Slackware, with somewhat less formal messages (like "INSTALL - come on mate, go for it!"), using the same curses (text) installer.
       </p>
       <p>
        This may lack some of the bells and whistles of the fancier graphical installers, but it works efficiently, even on limited hardware. There were a couple of problems that arose during installation that it would help to be aware of, rather than finding out towards the end of the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 5.8 installer hung while probing the graphics hardware on two systems and needed a reboot. The only way to avoid this was to skip this step. After booting, you only see a text login, because X is not configured, but logging as root and running xorgconfig soon fixed that.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was easiest to log into a second console and run lspci on that, skipping between the two with Alt+Left/Right to get answers to the questions answered by xorgconfig. Vector 5.9 had no such problems, but did require more disk space for a full install; if you have a 5GB or smaller drive, either use 5.8 or be selective during the installation, there is a place to choose which package groups you wish to install.
       </p>
       <h2>
        What's in the box?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Ask people to list the classic applications used on current computers, particularly the GTK alternatives, and you will hear names like OpenOffice.org, Firefox, Mozilla and Evolution a lot. These are all highly capable programs, but all that capability comes at a price in terms of the memory, processor power and, to a lesser extent, hard disk space they need.

        Running OpenOffice.org on a 128MB 700MHz computer would be painful at best. By the time it had finished loading, you would probably have forgotten the letter you wanted to write. Running KDE applications would be even more of an overload, not because KDE needs more but Xfce is already using GTK, so you would need two graphic interface toolkits loaded at once.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it is unlikely you will ever need everything that OpenOffice.org has to offer, certainly not all at once, and there are much lighter alternatives. Vector provides AbiWord for word processing, with Gnumeric for spreadsheets. Both of these can save and load files in OpenOffice.org and Microsoft formats, so you still have full portability of your data.
       </p>

        Both are mature programs with good core feature sets, missing only the esoteric functions that are mainly used to write marketing copy. Firefox is present, along with Opera. Yes, it is a bit big and noticeably slower to load than on a modern machine, but not much else comes close if you want to be able to use a large proportion of web pages.
       </p>
       <p>
        The performance was acceptable on our test rig, but if you are running anything much slower, particularly with less memory, Vector provides Dillo too. Dillo is the browser of choice for Damn Small Linux, which gives you an idea of how compact it is, but it is also amazingly fast. Dillo doesn't do HTTPS, so you won't be able to use it for online banking, but for many sites the speed more than makes up for the limitations.
       </p>

        Slackware is known for its rather, well, basic package management. Vector uses the same package system but includes the slapt tools, which work like the Debian programs but with Slackware packages. Slapt-get is for command line package management while gslapt is similar to the Synaptic package management GUI so familiar to Ubuntu users.
       </p>
       <p>
        This already has a couple of online repositories set up, you just need to press the Update button to download the latest list of available packages. Then you can search for and install programs with a point and a click (or several).
       </p>
       <p>
        The range of available programs isn't as large as with some of the more well-known (and well-funded) distros, but as this is basically Slackware, you can install from their repositories too, all you need to do is tick a couple of boxes in the gslapt preferences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alternatively, when a program has a Slackware package available for download, you can usually download and install it with installpkg - you can often find these at
        <a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net">
         www.linuxpackages.net
        </a>
        . Finally, the development tools are available with a standard install, so installing from source is usually straightforward, if a little slow on older hardware, when no dedicated package is available.
       </p>

        Mail is handled by Mozilla Mail, which is a surprising choice when there are excellent GTK mail programs like Claws Mail and Sylpheed. These are fast and lightweight, and not short of features either - personally, I use Claws Mail on my dual core desktop and my Nokia N800: it's nothing if not flexible.

        Child's play
       </h2>
       <p>
        A lower-powered machine makes an ideal first computer for the younger members of the family. Unless they want to play 3D games, in which case they probably have a games console anyway; a sub-1GHz computer is ample for a child to learn the basics of using a computer and run some educational software.
       </p>
       <p>
        You need to set up a separate account for your child to limit what they can do with the computer. You certainly want to restrict their access to system directories, lock them out of using su or sudo and possibly restrict their access to the Internet. A separate account also gives the opportunity to set up a more child-friendly desktop, including large, colourful icons and a means of launching their favourite programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        You add users using either VASM (Vector Administrative and Services Menu), Vector's original system administration program, which runs in X or text mode, or the purely graphical VASMCC. Create a new user but limit the groups they belong to. In particular, don't make them a member of anything administrative, like adm, sys or wheel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vector creates a new group for each user, but it does make all home directories world readable, which you may not want, so open a root terminal and run
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        chmod o-rwx /home/*
       </pre>
       <p>
        VASM allows you to create a user without a password, which may be a good idea for a younger child, but shouldn't be regarded as an easy way out, you may as well get your children into security habits as soon as possible. If this computer is mainly for the use of one child, you can set it up to automatically login for that user.
       </p>
       <div class="image">
        <img alt="When adding a user for your child, do not make it a member of any administrative groups, or you will get a broken computer - guaranteed!" src="/files/LXF102.resurrect.03adduser.jpg"/>

       <p>
        Vector uses the KDE display manager, kdm, but doesn't have the rest of the KDE infrastructure so you'll need to edit a configuration file by hand to enable this. The file is /usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc and must be edited as root. Go to the section headed [X-:0-Core] and find the AutoLoginEnable and AutoLoginUser entries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Remove any leading comment signs (#) and set them to true and the name of your user respectively and save the file. You may also want to set AutoLoginAgain, to stop them trying to log out and back in as another user. It depends on how inquisitive or destructive you think your kids are, although, in my experience, it is impossible to underestimate these qualities!
       </p>
       <p>
        You can still login as your user, which you will need to do to administer the system from time to time, either by switching to a virtual console with Ctrl+Alt+F1 or using Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill X. Then you can log in at the console and run startx if you want a GUI.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Limited options
       </h2>
       <p>
        You probably want to restrict the options available to a child, particularly a young one. You can do this by removing the panel and menu and putting icons on the desktop for each program you want them to be able to use. To remove the panel, right-click on it and select remove.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alternatively, right-click on the menu button, select remove and repeat this process for the other icons you no longer need. Then add the applications you want to the panel. To add icons to the desktop, browse /usr/share/applications and drag any icons you want to display into ~/Desktop. You will need some attractive icons and wallpapers. There are plenty of Xfce wallpapers and themes at
        <a href="http://xfce-look.org">
         http://xfce-look.org
        </a>
        , allowing you to make the desktop as child-friendly as you want.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you have finished changing the settings, you probably want to lock them down, which you can do as root with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        chown -R adultuser: /home/childuser/.config/xfce4
chmod -R +r /home/childuser/.config/xfce4
       </pre>
       <p>
        This will prevent the child user writing anywhere in the Xfce configuration directory, which is where most settings are stored, while still allowing the settings to be read. You can use the same principle to protect settings in other parts of the home directory.

        Safer browsing
       </h2>
       <p>
        Restricting internet use is a little more tricky, unless you want to take the blanket approach of preventing any Internet access from this machine, which is generally as simple as blocking it in your router's settings. If you want to control Internet access without blocking it, you need a filtering proxy server running on another computer.
       </p>
       <p>
        You could do this with an old machine running one of the distros intended for this, such as SmoothWall, ClarkConnect or IPCop (how many old computers did you say you had lying around the place?) In this case you would probably use a combination of Squid and either SquidGuard or DansGuardian.
       </p>
       <p>
        SquidGuard and DansGuardian both work with Squid, which is a proxy server, to provide filtering, but they differ in the way they filter. SquidGuard uses lists of sites to block or redirect requests to those considered unsuitable, while DansGuardian filters on the content of requested pages. While either combination could run in the background on your desktop, they are usually used on a separate machine. They can take some time to set up.
       </p>
       <p>
        An alternative is to run a simpler proxy on your own desktop machine, although that would be dependent on your computer always being available when internet access is required, which is fine if you don't dual boot. One such program is Willow, which is a content filter available from
        <a href="http://www.digitallumber.net/software/willow">
         www.digitallumber.net/software/willow
        </a>
        . Download the archive and, as root, unpack it to /var with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        tar xf willow-3.18.tar.gz -C /var
       </pre>
       <p>
        Copy the appropriate startup script to /etc/init.d and add willow to your default runlevel. If you get an error about being unable to open the exefilter module, remove the reference to exefilter by editing /var/willow/willow.conf and changing
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        filters = ['domainfilter','exefilter','contentfilter']
       </pre>
       <p>
        to
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        filters = ['domainfilter','contentfilter']
       </pre>
       <p>
        The exefilter isn't necessary if you are using it to protect a Linux box. Now all you need to do is set the default browser and configure it to use the Willow proxy. Starting the browser for the first time selects the default, select Firefox and then go into Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Network &gt; Connection Settings and manually set the HTTP Proxy to the hostname of the machine running Willow and port 8000. On the computer running willow, run
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        tail -f /var/log/messages
       </pre>
       <p>
        ...and load a web page into Firefox. You should see some messages scroll past as Willow fetches the data and passes it to Firefox on the other computer. The content of these messages is not so important, as long as the page loads, and willow does not scream any obvious errors, you know that browsing on the old computer is protected. Now you need to make sure it stays that way by making the preferences file read-only with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        chmod -w .mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXXX.default/prefs.js
       </pre>
       <p>
        Where XXXXXXXX is a string of random characters, you'll have to look in the directory (or use tab-completion) to see the actual name to use. It is also possible to extract this from .mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini with awk or grep and sed, but for a one-off, looking in the directory is easier, even if it scores less geek points. OK, if you really want the geek points, use this
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        chmod -w .mozilla/firefox/$(awk -F \= '/^Path=/ {print $2}' .mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini)/prefs.js
       </pre>
       <p>
        One word of warning about Willow - in order to filter effectively from the start, it comes with samples of good and bad sites and content. The bad sites include explicit pornographic sites and equally undesirable content (which is why we haven't included it on the DVD) so do not install this on the computer to be used by your child, only on the one you will use as the filtering proxy. The bad content cannot be viewed through the proxy server, only by browsing the filesystem.
       </p>
       <p>
        You probably also want to block popups in Firefox, not only are these annoying and potentially confusing for children, many of them have unsuitable content. Go to
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">
         https://addons.mozilla.org
        </a>
        and search for "adblock", the results give you the choice of the original Adblock extension or the newer Adblock Plus, either of which will banish those annoying popups, an addition that is useful for all children under the age of 195!
       </p>

        There are a number of specialised uses for an old computer. Running X uses quite a lot of resources, so anything that doesn't need a graphical display is a good candidate for a slower machine. There are various types of server that you could run on it, either because they fulfill a specific need or just because it is fun to try new things. You may want to install Vector without X in this case, although it costs you nothing but disk space to install with X but not use it.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are going to run any kind of server, you will need a static IP address. The default setup of almost every distro is to use DHCP to get an address from your modem/router, which is no good if you want to connect from another computer. Run VasmCC and go to Network &gt; Netconf.
       </p>
       <p>
        Select static configuration and give an unused IP address in the range used by your router. Your router's configuration page should show this, but stay out of the range allocated for DHCP addresses. In general, DHCP uses the higher numbers for the last part of the address, say 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200, so use a lower number to avoid conflicts. The gateway and DNS should be set to the address of your router.

        Mail without spam?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Running your own mail server may seem like overkill, but there are a number of good reasons for doing so; you can
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        </li>
        <li>
         Access your mail from more than one computer, say a desktop and a laptop, keeping both in sync
        </li>
        <li>
         Download mail from several email accounts, your ISP, Google mail, etc, and put them all in one place
        </li>
        <li>
         Download mail for all family members and sort it into separate mailboxes. Mail downloads are much faster, because the slow part of pulling it for the ISP has already been done in the background.
        </li>
        <li>
         Run spam filtering software to sort out the rubbish before you even fire up your mail program.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The last one is particularly important if you are providing Internet access for a child, since the content of some of the spam is offensive to most adults, let alone children. There are three aspects to mail serving: receiving mail from outside and delivering to local mailboxes, serving mail for the local mailboxes to mail clients, receiving and forwarding outgoing mail from the clients.
       </p>

        For most people, the third stage is not necessary, but fell free to install something like Postfix if you want to try it out. For the first step, the standard program is fetchmail. Install this and run fetchmailconf to generate a configuration file. Alternatively, use this with the appropriate substitutions:
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        set daemon 300
poll mail.myisp.com with proto POP3
  user 'myispuser' there with password 'mypass' is 'myuser' here options keep
mda '/usr/bin/procmail -d %T'
       </pre>
       <p>
        and set it to be readable by only your user with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        chmod 600 ~/.fetchmailrc
       </pre>
       <p>
        myispuser and mypass should be the login and password for your ISP mailbox while myuser is your local username. This tells fetchmail to check your ISP's mail server every five minutes (300 seconds) and deliver the mail using procmail instead of looking for a local mail server, which should be installed by default.
       </p>
       <p>
        The keep option leaves the mail on the server, remove this once you are sure everything works. You can have multiple "poll...  user..." stanzas to collect mail from more than one mailbox. Save this as .fetchmailrc in your home directory. Configure procmail to deliver the mail by putting this in ~/.procmailrc (or /etc/procmailrc if you will be collecting mail for more than one user).
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        MAILDIR=/var/spool/mail
DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/$LOGNAME/
       </pre>
       <p>
        The trailing / is important, it tells procmail to use maildir storage, which is needed by the IMAP server later. As root, create the mail directory with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        mkdir -p /var/spool/mail/myuser
chown myuser:mail /var/spool/mail/myuser
chmod 770 /var/spool/mail/myuser
       </pre>
       <p>
        Test it with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        fetchmail --daemon 0 -v
       </pre>
       <p>
        This turns off the background mode and shows what's happening. If it works you can set fetchmail to run automatically by selecting Settings &gt; Autostarted Applications, pressing Add and typing fetchmail in the Command box; use your imagination for the other two. Fetchmail will now run each time the desktop loads. However, you probably want it running all the time, irrespective of the desktop, so instead you can add a line to the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        su myuser -c fetchmail
       </pre>
       <p>
        All commands in rc.local are run as root, so su is needed to run it as your user (running fetchmail as root is considered bad practice). You can repeat this process for each user for whom you need to collect mail, putting their details in .fetchmailrc in their home directory and a line to start fetchmail for them in rc.local.

       </h2>
       <p>
        Now you have the mail on your server, you need users to be able to collect it. There are a number of IMAP and POP3 servers available, my preference is for Dovecot (
        <a href="http://dovecot.org">
         http://dovecot.org
        </a>
        ). This isn't in the Vector or Slackware repositories so download the package file from www.linuxpackages.net and install it with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        installpkg dovecot-1.0.7-i486-1kjz.tgz
       </pre>
       <p>
        Once installed, configure it by copying /etc/dovecot/dovecot-example.conf to /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and load it into your favourite editor. Find the section for "Mailbox locations and namespaces" and add
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        mail_location = /var/spool/mail/%u
       </pre>
       <p>
        and change
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        #ssl_disable = no
       </pre>
       <p>
        and
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        #disable_plaintext_auth = yes
       </pre>
       <p>
        to
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        ssl_disable = yes
       </pre>
       <p>
        and
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        disable_plaintext_auth = no
       </pre>
       <p>
        You don't need SSL authentication if you are only using it on a home network. If you want to be able to access this server from outside, you need to read the documentation on SSL to allow secure logins. Comment out the line passdb pam { and the subsequent closing brace and uncomment #passdb passwd { and its closing brace, Vector does not use PAM authentication. Then move the startup script to the location used by Vector with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        mv /etc/rc.d/rc.dovecot /etc/rc.d/init.d/dovecot
       </pre>
       <p>
        and tell VasmCC to start the service. If you want to use POP3 to collect mail in addition to the default IMAP, you need to change
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        #protocols = imap imaps
       </pre>
       <p>
        to
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        protocols = imap imaps pop3 pop3s
       </pre>
       <p>
        and set
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        pop3_uidl_format = %v.%u
       </pre>
       <p>
        Now you can set your mail clients to point to your Vector Linux box, using the username and password you have set on there. By using IMAP rather than POP3 to connect, your mail stays on the local server, so it will be the same whichever computer you downloaded it from, so there will be no more trying to find an email on your laptop when you downloaded it to your desktop, or having to remember to synchronise the mail directories of the two machines before you switch from one to the other.

        De-spam with dspam
       </h2>
       <p>
        Being able to download and serve your mail locally is great, but far too much of it is spam. Wouldn't it be great if you could get rid of the spam before you even fired up your email program? When we set up fetchmail to collect your mail, we told it to use procmail to deliver the mail.
       </p>
       <p>
        An enhancement is to have it pass the mail to a spam filter, which would remove the rubbish and pass only the good (or not too bad) mails to procmail. One of the most popular programs for this is Spam Assassin, but I have found dspam to be more effective. Both use Bayesian filtering, where they analyse the content of the mails and give them a spamminess rating based on a number of criteria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The default setup for dspam is to move the spam to a quarantine area, so you only download the mail that passes the tests. The quarantine can be viewed with a web browser, from where you can pick out any 'false positives', mails that have been incorrectly tagged as spam and delete the rest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dspam learns from its mistakes, so each time you mark a false positive, you reduce the chances of that error recurring. Similarly, you can send spams that made it through the filters back to dspam, teaching it further. I now get very few spams leaking through, and almost no false positives, despite receiving in excess of a thousand spam mails some days.

There do not appear to be any Slackware packages for dspam, so download it from
        <a href="http://dspam.nuclearelephant.com">
         http://dspam.nuclearelephant.com
        </a>
        and install it with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        tar xf dspam-3.8.0.tar.gz
cd dspam-3.8.0
less README
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
make
su
make install
       </pre>
       <p>
        Now edit /etc/dspam.conf and remove the leading # signs to uncomment the lines
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        #TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/procmail"
#UntrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/procmail -d %u"
       </pre>
       <p>
        and edit your .fetchmailrc file(s) to change the mda line to
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        mda /usr/local/bin/dspam --deliver=innocent -- -d %T
       </pre>
       <p>
        Now fetchmail passes the message to dspam, which checks for spam and delivers clean mails via procmail. Spam mails are kept in quarantine and must be accessed via a web browser. This entails setting up a web server with the appropriate CGI scripts and authentication mechanisms, and also means that users have to log onto the web server to check for any false positives.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is another way, change --deliver=innocent above to --deliver=innocent,spam, which means that all mails are delivered to your mailbox, spam and non-spam. Before you start shouting "what's the point in that", consider that even though it is delivering all the mails to your mailbox, it is adding headers including one for X-DSPAM-Result that contains either Innocent or Spam.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can use these to filter spams into a separate folder in your mail program, meaning you can check and delete your spams quickly, without having to fire up a browser.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bayesian spam filters like dspam learns from your mails, you can give it a head start by passing it a collection of good mails and another of spam mails (if you haven't deleted them). Select them in your mail program and save them as a individual files, in directories for spam and non-spam (sometimes referred to as 'ham').
       </p>
       <p>
        Since mail programs often keep mails as separate files, this could be as simple as copying your mail and spam folders. Then copy these files to the server and train dspam with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        dspam_train username spam_dir nonspam_dir
       </pre>
       <p>
        You must give spam and non-spam to dspam_train for it to be able to learn anything useful.

        A digital insurance policy
       </h2>
       <p>
        Hands up those who remember complaining about the hassle of changing floppy disk to do backups? Now 4GB DVDs are too small and large capacity tape drives cost more than the computer you are backing up, although maybe not as much as the cost of the irreplaceable data you could lose.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is an alternative, and it is sitting right in front of you (or in your loft if you haven't dug out the old box yet). Serving files over a network requires very little CPU power or memory, all you need to build a backup server (or any kind of file server) is a computer with enough hard drive space and a network card.
       </p>
       <p>
        As hard drives are one of the few components in a computer to work physically as well as electronically, they are subject to wear and tear so a 5-10 year old drive may not be the safest place to backup your treasured files. But new drives are cheap with 160GB drives selling for around 30.
       </p>
       <p>
        Use the existing drive to install the operating system and reserve the new drive purely for storage, that way you keep your system files and data separate. If your system disk is on /dev/hda, put the backup drive on hdc or hdd, so the two drives are on different controllers. Your CD-ROM is probably already on hdc, so set the drive's jumpers to slave and connect it to the same controller as the CD-ROM.
       </p>
       <p>
        Partition the drive with cfdisk or gparted. You will need to install gparted for this and it has a lot of dependencies, for this one-off job it is easier to use cfdisk with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        cfdisk /dev/hdd
       </pre>
       <p>
        Press n to create a new partition and hit Enter twice to accept the defaults and create a partition spanning the whole disk; enter a different size if you want a smaller partition. Press W (it must be capital W) to write the changes and type "yes" to confirm, then q to exit and reboot to make sure the kernel re-reads the partition table. Now create a filesystem with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        mke2fs -j /dev/hdd1
       </pre>
       <p>
        Make sure you give the right device name or you will trash the wrong partition! Now add it to /etc/fstab
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        /dev/hdd1  /mnt/backup  ext2  noatime 0 0
       </pre>
       <p>
        and mount it with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        mkdir /mnt/backup
mount -a
df -h /mnt/backup
       </pre>
       <p>
        The last command should show that it is mounted and 99 per cent empty. Now you can export it to the other computers on your network by adding this line to /etc/exports
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        /mnt/backup 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,rw,sync)
       </pre>
       <p>
        The first three numbers in the IP address there should be the same as everything on your network, the final one is zero. Go into the services section of VasmCC and ensure that portmap is set to start on your run level and make /mnt/backup available to the rest of the network with
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        exportfs -a
exportfs
       </pre>
       <p>
        The first line exports the shared directory, the second lists all shares, so you can see that it worked. Now you can mount the backup directory on each computer on your network by adding this to /etc/fstab on each one
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        192.168.1.N:/mnt/backup  /mnt/backup  nfs  nosuid,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,soft  0 0
       </pre>
       <p>
        Where 192.168.1.N is the IP address of the server. How you actually make the backups is up to you, any program that writes backups to files can be used. It could be a simple as having a directory for each computer in /mnt/backup and having a cron job that does something like
       </p>
       <pre class="command">
        tar czf /mnt/backup/$HOST/home-$(date -I)-.tar.gz /home
       </pre>
       <p>
        that will tar up the home directory into a file containing the date, leaving you to delete older archives as you see fit. Or you could run something like BackupPC (http://backuppc.sourceforge.net) that will backup a network of machines to a single server, the choice is yours. Of course, you don't have to use a file server for backups.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are plenty of other used for shared network storage, such as storing your music or video collection. NFS works best with Unix-like operating systems (including Mac OS X). If you want to share files with Windows, you'll be better off with Samba.
       </p>
       <h2>
        The web at home
       </h2>
       <p>
        You could also use your computer to run a web server. It won't be up to running an online commerce site, but you could use it for testing your site before uploading it, or just for the fun of seeing how a web server works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The de facto standard web server is Apache, but this is a big beast and there are lighter alternatives to play with, like boa, cherokee, lighthttpd and thpptd.
       </p>
       <p>
        We chose to use boa, simply because it is available to install through gslapt. After installation, edit /etc/boa/boa.conf and change DocumentRoot to /home/www then start boa through the Services section of VasmCC and you are ready to add content to /home/www and access it from any browser on your network.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've only scratched the surface of what you can do with redundant hardware - use your imagination! Look at some of the specialist distros on DistroWatch (
        <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">
         www.distrowatch.com
        </a>
        ) for some ideas. Or you could set up a home automation system using X10 modules, all controlled from a web browser.
       </p>
       <p>
        You could even use a text-to-email gateway to turn the lights and TV on before you get home by sending a text message from your phone!

         It would be possible to use an old computer as a MythTV backend, but it would be limited in what it could do, transcoding and commercial detection would take a long time, but recording broadcasts that are already MPEG streams needs only modest horsepower.
        </p>
        <p>
         Add a Freeview card or two and a good sized hard drive and you could use it as a recording backend.
Running a frontend is far less demanding, the only part of this task that really works the hardware is decoding MPEG streams, and that is not a consideration if your video card has a hardware decoder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Such cards are really cheap nowadays, something like a Nvidia FX5200 can be had for less than twenty pounds. Add another ten pounds for a quieter CPU cooler and a USB remote control and you have all you need. Because modern CPUs generate so much more heat, modern coolers are more efficient, so any half-decent cooler can be used, and usually run at a slower speed to reduce noise still further.

       I would recommend using sidux over Vector.  I am using sidux on a PIII machine with 156 meg of ram, and a 15 gig hard drive.  The hard drive is spilt into 2 partitions of about equal size.  Why?  I didn't want to have to recopy the music files that were already on the drive  Sidux detected and set up the on-board audio chip which Vector, Mepis, and Mint wouldn't do.  The machine runs OpenOffice just fine, and I have no trouble with Flash videos in Firefox.  I do agree that the jump from 128Meg of ram to 256 meg of ram is the bigest performance boost for these types of machines.  However, not all SDRam is created equal.  SDRam that works in one machine may not work in another similar machine.  There are web sites that let you find the memory that works in a particular machine, and get its specs.  Best to use these and get memory that you know will work!

       While I applaud the effort of this article, I'd point out a few topics:
      </p>
      <p>
       1] You casually bought memory from eBay... not everyone buys anything from eBay, which puts the reader into a tight spot for locating older system hardware.
       <br/>
       -Socket 7/Slot 1 CPU coolers (the old systems are retired after years of use and/or becoming noisy),
       <br/>
       -ISA/basic PCI graphics cards (older ATI cards might be tough to get drivers installed, S3 cards were hit or miss, Video7, VooDoo II, Hercules, etc. are possibly not supported today),
       <br/>
       -small capacity IDE disk drives (today is the sunset of the factory new IDE hard disk in retail distribution, those are usually &gt;&gt;200 GB, some systems can't support drives that big, SATA/USB3 is prevalent at the local PC shop),
       <br/>
       -72 pin EDO/nonEDO simms (and why that matters/how to tell the difference), PC100/PC133/Buffered/Unbuffered,
       <br/>
       -etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       All well and good, if you are competent in that area and have access to quality and quantity of stashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       2] Target audience? If you (re)build it, will they use it?
       <br/>
       Format: Linux traditional software (Microsoft traditional software).
       <br/>
       -This isn't Firefox (Internet Explorer)!
       <br/>
       -Where is the Open Office (Microsoft Office) stuff?
       <br/>
       -Is Pidgin (AIM/MSN/YIM/ICQ) installed?
       <br/>
       -Why are all the menu items different? How do I...?
       <br/>
       -Why is xyz taking so long to load?
       <br/>
       -Not many choices, dad....
      </p>
      <p>
       The user of your system will have to be patient, empathetic, and flexible. Even experienced Linux users could choke with your compromises (I speak from experience). Those compromises are why I'm tossing out all my stashes of PC hardware from Slot 1 and older systems (except for that dual Slot 1 Dell Precision 410 Workstation, that has to be the 11th wonder of the world).
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW: in the USA, all older TV cards, which are mostly Analog, are going to need a Digital converter box for any broadcast connections. OTOH, connecting a DVD player or VCR should still be done the old way (unless the DVD exclusively uses HDMI or non-RF output).
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, a very nice article, was good to have read it. Hats off to StumbleUpon for resurrecting this!

       I have been using linux (ubuntu) since I started university over a year ago now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've picked up bits and pieces as I have gone along and LOVE my operating system and the way things work. It just makes so much more sense than windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhows, cutting back to the chase!, I have been looking for a project to help increase my knowledge and I have an old windows laptop knocking about. Putting 2 and 2 together I am gonna install a light weight distro and see what new lease of life can be breathed into it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the inspiration! lol

      <p>
       Going to bookmark this, and try some of it later, but..
       <br/>
       Ubuntu 9.04 on 700mhz celeron 12mb 16?mb tnt2 pci. Gui actions are molasses-like.
       <br/>
       On similar pc with 64mb card, only slightly molasses-like.
       <br/>
       And still molasses-like after installed the xubuntu (Xfce based to what degree?) desktop. However, all the gnome menus remain, so perhaps i need a complete xubuntu install rather than just the desktop replacement package?
       <br/>
       Xp home runs fine with av and firewall on both of these pcs.
       <br/>
       I strongly suspect the graphics is the bottleneck in linux. i tried envy one on or both pcs, but on at least one pc, error messages indicated nvidia proprietary drives did not "stick".
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise... another older pc...
       <br/>
       300mhz 128?mb 256?mb performs fine with win98se, running super lite av and firewall, opera or kmeleon. Though compared to winme or xp, 98 is rather ugly.
       <br/>
       Especially since the pc is behind an spi router, there's no way any partial cli os can compete in usability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like some of nix ditros to an extent, and am hopeful, but i expected the middle weight distros (pclos2008, slax from 2007, even dsl-not,,,i forget other distros, but puppy seemed too crude to try) to run great on the 700+mhz 512+mb pcs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the "incessant" user+password (either synaptics-whatever or whenever cli "sudo" this or that) is really annoying (productivity killer) since i am running as default user (= admin?)
      </p>
      <p>
       UAC in vista is annoying, but you just click the ok button as appropriate (which is always). firewall seems to never learn for a few utilities, and that's also annoying, but still only  a few mouse clicks. No need to type in my long complex less-crackable password.
      </p>
      <p>
       And... the vista ui is a usability mess, and uglier than windows classic on xp. there's no point in trying vista on a pc that won't run xp. I haven't tried win7, but i guess it won't run well on even a p4 (athlon (after athlon xp), etc).
