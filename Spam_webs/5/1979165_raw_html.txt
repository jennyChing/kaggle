     Introduction to Metaphysics of Yin &amp; Yang
    </h2>
    <p>
     The idea of opposites (Yin Yang, the union and harmony of opposites) has existed 
  in both Eastern and Western philosophy since ancient times. Of the Ancient Greek 
  Philosophers, Heraclitus and Parmenides both understood that the Universe was 
  One and Dynamic. As Bertrand Russell writes on Heraclitus;
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
     For Heraclitus the unity of things was to be found in their essential 
  structure or arrangement rather than their material. This common structure or 
  Logos, which was not superficially apparent, was chiefly embodied in a Single 
  kinetic material, Fire. It was responsible both for the regularity of natural 
  changes and for the
     <strong>
      essential connexion of opposites
     </strong>
     - Heraclitus 
  adopted this traditional analysis of differentiation - through balanced interaction. 
  The regularity underlying change was for Heraclitus the significant thing .. 
  (Bertrand Russell on Heraclitus, The History of Western Philosophy)
    </p>
    <p class="ac">
     It is also interesting to read the original fragments of Heraclitus' 
  own writing;
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="quote">
      Listening to the Logos rather than to me, it is wise to 
  agree that all things are in reality one thing and one thing only. (Heraclitus)
     </span>
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
     Things which are put together are both whole and not whole, 
  brought together and taken apart, in harmony and out of harmony; one thing arises 
  from all things, and all things arise from one thing.
     <span class="quote">
      (Heraclitus)
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="quote">
      As a single, unified thing there exists in us both life 
  and death, waking and sleeping, youth and old age, because the former things 
  having changed are now the latter, and when those latter things change, they 
  become the former. (Heraclitus)
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Parmenides viewed this Oneness in a different manner to Heraclitus;
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
     The One is infinite and indivisible. It is not, as Heraclitus, 
  a union of opposites, since there are no opposites. Parmenides apparently thought, 
  for instance, that 'cold' means only 'not hot' and 'dark' means only 'not light'. 
  ... Parmenides seems to think of it (the One) as material and extended, for 
  he speaks of it as a sphere. But it cannot be divided, because of the whole 
  of it is present everywhere. (
     <strong>
      Russell
     </strong>
     , 1946)
    </p>
    <p>
     However, it is clear that both Philosophy and Metaphysics are founded on this 
  Dynamic Unity and Order / Harmony of Reality, as Nietzsche (rather grandly) 
  states,
    </p>
    <p>
     <img align="left" alt="Nietzsche - That which drove him (Thales) to this generalization was a metaphysical dogma, which had its origin in a mystic intuition and which together with the ever renewed endeavours to express it better, we find in all philosophies - the proposition: everything is one!" height="80" id="Nietzsche" name="Nietzsche" src="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Images/Nietzsche.jpg" width="80"/>
     <span class="quote">
      (
      <strong>
       Friedrich Nietzsche
      </strong>
      , The Greeks, 1880) 
  Greek philosophy seems to begin with a preposterous fancy, with the proposition 
  (of Thales) that water is the origin and mother-womb of all things. Is it really 
  necessary to stop there and become serious? Yes, and for three reasons: firstly, 
  because the proposition does enunciate something about the origin of things; 
  secondly, because it does so without figure and fable; thirdly and lastly, because 
  it contained, although only in the chrysalis state, the idea :everything is 
  one. ... That which drove him (Thales) to this generalization was a metaphysical 
  dogma, which had its origin in a mystic intuition and which together with the 
  ever renewed endeavours to express it better, we find in all philosophies - 
  the proposition: everything is one!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     This understanding of the Unity of the Universe is also shared by many Eastern 
  philosophers (in fact one could say that this the foundation of the Eastern 
  world view - All is One and Dynamic).
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
     Though One, Brahman is the cause of the many. .. Brahman is 
  the unborn (aja) in whom all existing things abide. The One manifests as the 
  many, the formless putting on forms. (
     <strong>
      Rig Veda
     </strong>
     )
     <br/>
     The word Brahman means growth and is suggestive of life, motion, progress. (
     <strong>
      Radhakrishnan
     </strong>
     )

     While this webpage is on Yin Yang, it is primarily concerned with the metaphysics 
  of Yin Yang, and what this knowledge is telling us about physical reality.

     In particular, it is now quite easy to show that the Metaphysics of Space 
  and Motion and the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) provides a simple explanation 
  of these ancient ideas of the universe (All is One, Interconnected, Dynamic). 
  From this perspective of describing reality in terms of One Dynamic Thing, Space, 
  and its properties as a Wave-Medium (rather than 'particles and fields in space-time) 
  we find simple sensible solutions to many of the current problems of modern 
  Physics, Philosophy and Metaphysics.

     The Wave Structure of Matter
     <br/>
     Describing Reality from the Most Simple Science Foundation

     From 'Particles' &amp; Spherical 'Field's in 'Space-Time', to Spherical Waves 
  in Space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Please see links on the side of this page for the main articles which explain and solve many of the problems of postmodern Metaphysics, Physics and Philosophy from the new foundation of the Metaphysics of Space and Motion and the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Ancient Greek Philosophers were 
  often very close to the truth, as reflected in Parmenides realisation that the 
  One existent is material (substance), extended (Space) and a Sphere (caused 
  by matter as Spherical Waves in Space). Further, the Wave-Center of the Spherical 
  Waves, which causes the discrete particle effect, is not a division, but rather, 
  a production from the One Unity, the Focal-Point of Spherical Standing Waves 
  that determine the size of our finite spherical Universe within an Infinite 
  Space.
     <br/>
     The Spherical In and Out Waves of the Wave Structure of Matter explains the 
  change and harmony of opposites in the One Universe.

      Lama Govinda
     </strong>
     , 1977) The fundamental element of the cosmos 
  is Space. Space is the all-embracing principle of higher unity. Nothing can 
  exist without Space. Space is the precondition of all that exists, be it material 
  or immaterial form, because we can neither imagine an object nor a being without 
  space. According to ancient Indian tradition the universe reveals itself in 
  two fundamental properties: as Motion, and as that in which motion takes place, 
  namely Space. This Space is called akasa, and is that through which things step 
  into visible appearance, i.e., through which they possess extension or corporeality.
     <br/>
     Akasa is derived from the root kas, 'to radiate, to shine', and has therefore 
  the meaning of 'ether', which is conceived as the medium of movement. The principle 
  of movement, however, is prana, the breath of life, the all-powerful, all-pervading 
  rhythm of the universe.

    <p align="left" class="quote">
     Transiency is as necessary to immortality (or to 
  the experience of eternity), as the body is to the soul, or as matter is to 
  mind. And in saying so, we might note that these are not irreconcilable or totally 
  exclusive opposites, but rather the extreme points in the amplitude of the swinging 
  pendulum, i.e. parts of the same movement. By becoming conscious of the inner 
  direction and relationship of our transient life, we discover the eternity in 
  time, immortality in transiency- and thus we transform the fleeting shapes of 
  phenomena into timeless symbols of reality.
     <br/>
     Liberation is not escapism, but consists in the conscious transformation of 
  the elements that constitute our world and our existence. This is the great 
  secret of the Tantras and of the mystics of all time.

    <p class="quote">
     The perfect mutual interpenetration of forms, processes, things, 
  beings, etc., and the presence of the experiencing subject in all of them - 
  in other words, the simultaneity of differentiation and oneness, of individuality 
  and universality, of form and emptiness - is the main thesis of the great Buddhist 
  philosopher Nagarjuna, who lived in the second century of our era.
     <br/>
     His philosophy of the Middle Way consists in a new orientation 
  of thought, freed from the rigidity of the concept of substance 
  or that of a static universe, in which things and beings were thought of as 
  more or less independent units, so that concepts like identity 
  and non-identity could be applied to them and form the basis of 
  discursive thought.
     <br/>
     Where, however, everything is in flux, such concepts - and a logic derived from 
  them - cannot be adequate and, therefore, the relationship of form to emptiness 
  and vice-versa cannot be conceived as a mutually exclusive nature of as absolute 
  opposites, but only as two aspects of the same reality, co-existing in continuous 
  co-operation. Because form (rupa) must not be confused with thingness 
  or materiality, since each form is the expression of a creative actor or process 
  in a beginningless and endless movement, whose precondition, according to Nagarjuna 
  is precisely that mysterious emptiness (or Plenum-void, 
  as it has been aptly called) expressed in the term Sunyata.
     <br/>
     In this experience of timeless reality beyond the realm of opposites, the relative 
  is not annihilated in favour of the absolute nor is the manifoldness of life 
  sacrificed to an abstract unity, but
     <strong>
      the individual and the universal 
  penetrate and condition each other so completely that the one cannot be separated 
  from the other
     </strong>
     . They are as inseparable as time and space, and like 
  these they represent two aspects of the same reality: time is the dynamic aspect 
  of individual (and therefore incomplete) action and experience; space is the 
  sum total of all activity in its ever-complete and therefore timeless aspect.

     <img alt="Capra - Modern physics then, pictures matter not at all as passive and inert, but being in a continuous dancing and vibrating motion whose rhythmic patterns are determined by the molecular, atomic and nuclear structures. This is also the way in which the Eastern mystics see the material world.

     (
     <strong>
      Fritjof Capra
     </strong>
     , 1972) In Indian philosophy, the main terms 
  used by Hindus and Buddhists have dynamic connotations. The word Brahman is 
  derived from the Sanskrit root brih . to grow - and thus suggests a reality 
  which is dynamic and alive. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan, The word Brahman 
  means growth and is suggestive of life, motion, progress.
     <br/>
     The Upanishads refer to Brahman as 'this uniformed, immortal, moving', thus 
  associating it with motion even though it transcends all forms. The Rig Veda 
  uses another term to express the dynamic character of the universe, the term 
  Rita. This word comes from the root ri- to move; its original meaning in the 
  Rig Veda being 'the course of all things', 'the order of nature'.
     <br/>
     The central aim of Eastern mysticism is to experience all the phenomena in the 
  world as manifestations of the same ultimate reality. This reality is seen as 
  the essence of the universe, underlying and unifying the multitude of things 
  and events we observe. The Hindus call it Brahman, The Buddhists Dharmakaya 
  (The Body of Being) or Tathata (Suchness) and the Taoists Tao; each affirming 
  that it transcends our intellectual concepts and defies further explanation. 
  This ultimate essence, however, cannot be separated from its multiple manifestations. 
  It is central to the very nature to manifest itself in myriad forms which come 
  into being and disintegrate, transforming themselves into one another without 
  end. In its phenomenal aspect, the cosmic One is thus intrinsically dynamic, 
  and the apprehension of its dynamic nature is basic to all schools of Eastern 
  mysticism.
     <br/>
     Modern physics then, pictures matter not at all as passive and inert, but being
