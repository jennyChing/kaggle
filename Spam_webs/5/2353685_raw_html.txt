           Plenty of vampire-werewolf angst will be hitting the big screen later this month when
           <a href="http://screencrave.com/tag/new-moon/">
            <strong>
             <em>
              The Twilight Saga: New Moon
             </em>
            </strong>
           </a>
           debuts in theaters across the country. The stories, penned by author Stephenie Meyer, have resonated with teen girls everywhere who affectionately call themselves, Twihards. This article is written from the perspective of someone who wasnt familiar with the books, but decided to give the film a chance, and was thoroughly turned off by everything it had to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
           The protagonist Bella Swan,  isnt a positive representation of what any young girl should aspire to be. She has no identity of her own and is under the constant influence of the male figures in her life. That type of nonchalant attitude towards her manipulation isnt something that should be projected, especially to women in her age group who are starting to date for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
           Heres the problem with
           <em>
            Twilight
           </em>

           <strong>
            Bella Constantly Needs a Male Figure in Her Life.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           First Bella lives with her dad, then she becomes immediately infatuated with Edward and from then on, the vampire occupies her thoughts. In
           <em>
            New Moon
           </em>
           when he takes a leave of absence whats a girl to do? Find something in them self? NO! Find another man! Enter Jacob, another troubled male figure who helps her cope with her loss and then leaves her hanging. Whatever happened to sitting down and having some
           <em>
            me
           </em>
           time?
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Bella and Edwards Double Standard
            <br/>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           In
           <em>
            Twilight
           </em>
           , Edward is pretty much a stalker. He lurks in the shadows and follows Bellas every move and even goes as far as watching her sleep. For some odd reason thats considered sexy and dangerous, but in a good way. If the roles were reversed and a woman did that, she would immediately be labeled as a psycho, and the men in the white coats would come after her, but for some odd reason when Edward does it, its romantic.

          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Bella is a Shell of a Human Being.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           She has no identity of her own, and literally loses her mind without the constant influence of vampire boy. At the end of
           <em>
            Twilight
           </em>
           , when Edward attempts to leave her in the hospital, she almost gives herself a stroke. Again in
           <em>
            New Moon
           </em>
           , when he tells her he has to go (because hes a danger to her), shes shown on the ground in the fetal position, looking a junkie whose about to kill herself. I get that they have a chemical bond, but they both exhibit actions towards one another that looks more like a drug addiction not a relationship. Hell, they cant even have sex because of it, it sounds like they truly just need a fix. What kind of role model is that for 13-year-old girls who think that their crush on Johnny is exactly the same? Its not okay!

            Twilight Objectifies Women
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Typically when you think of women being objectified in film it has to do with sex or nudity. In this case it has to do with both Edward and Jacobs constant coddling of Bella. Its as if shes a fragile flower who always has to be protected. Both men make it their lifes work to keep her safe, even more than her own father does. Wheres her brain? Wheres her own sense of self?

           <strong>
            This is Not a Healthy Relationship
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Edward gets Bella to leave her family and friends to appease him, which eventually leads to marriage and a half vampire baby (which shouldnt be possible since hes dead)! Its not OK for anyone, let alone a teenage girl to toss everything to the wind at a boyfriends request. Its also not healthy for you to be drawn to someone who constantly reminds you that he wants to eat you for dinner. Bella really only connects with Edward on a chemical level, and their connection causes her to nearly kill herself multiple times over  that sounds more like meth than love to me.
          </p>

            Overall
           </strong>
           
          </p>
          <p>
           These are just a few of the major feminist issues with Stephenie Meyers leading lady. For something created by a woman directed at young women its sad to see so many negative characteristics in a female driven story. Bella isnt a strong character and shouldnt be revered for her behavior in these films. Shes nothing more than a shadow for a man rather than a pillar for herself and not only is that dangerous but its a discouraging message to send to girls.
          </p>

           <strong>
            Do you think Bella Swan is a bad influence for young women?

                ppl speak their thoughts, feelings and opinions based on their stations in life and states of being (mentally, emotionally, physically or spiritually) at the time. everyone needs to keep that in mind before they bash at others self-righteously.
               </p>
               <p>
                those of you who are mature enough to see through the veils and extract the meaning behind the meanings from the Twilight series, should keep in mind that once upon a time you were unable to see clearly as well (albeit not regarding Twilight but x, y, z) and you too may have taken fantasy to be reality at the time and perhaps have now forgotten those days. now that you have learned well and developed, give some time for the others to do the same. keep in mind that the next paradigm shift, that seemed to begin a decade ago and will probably last into another few decades is one of intelligence and fast-paced insight. Translation: young people are becoming smarter a hell of a lot faster and despite the distractions and dilemnas, they usually wake up to reality and/or move on and dont obsess over such characters and fictional role models. altho one can argue that only time will tell, yet never say never and have hope in the future. in todays world, we need advice coupled with hope and encouragement more than anything else.
               </p>
               <p>
                and as for the youngeons and those a bit older for the genre or series as well as all the Twilight fanatics: try not to take these movies/books seriously as with anything else in life. balance the equation and see these as outlets for trivial entertainment at the least or a means to an end at most. a means being something that moves you upwards in which case you learn what there is to be learned, experience it, develop yourself internally and externally and MOVE ON. there are too many dramas/romances out there that are from the subconscious of OTHER ppl. instead, why not create your own life in a way thats perfect for YOU, instead of attaching your self to fiction or reality show specials that are just depictions of other ppls lives. and if you are watching them for the sake of listening and learning, then take the positive and beneficial points and apply it to life and leave out all the unnecessary baggage. there is enough troubles and dramas in our lives. why add more? especially when they are artificially made for the purpose of re-creating a fantasy novel? EVERYONE has a story to tell.
               </p>
               <p>
                write your own and follow it up with action instead of daydreaming.

               </p>
               <p>
                After watching 2/3 twilights with my gf, I found this site googling for Twilight Bella is a loser.
               </p>
               <p>
                Lets put this in context:
               </p>
               <p>
                Lets say you had a sister, who became suicidally desperate in the absence of her high-school true love;  Lets say this true love represents a very serious danger to her life, expresses he has a subconscious drive to wolf her down like a steak and consistently introduces her to life threatening situations; lets say that no matter how fickle he is, she clings so desperately to him that she is willing to permanently sacrifice her other friendships, family, career  her life as she knows it  to be with this fellow shes known for like a year.
               </p>
               <p>
                If my sister did that, Id slap her upside the head and tell her to come to her senses and ditch the jackass.
               </p>
               <p>
                How can anyone idolize or even respect this character?  I hope none of the 13 y/o girls in the theatre thinks that this is how REAL relationships are supposed to go down lol.  May the ghost of Susan B. Anthony haunt the script writers forever! ^^

                Its a book people.  We read books to escape our reality for a while.  We don't believe that Bella, Edward and all the others are somehow real life characters and that their tragic relationship would work in real life.  We fans get lost in the magic of the story, we don't apply it to our own lives.  We don't expect a man to be like Edward, that would be creepy and depressing.  His character can be such a downer at times, it would not be fun.  Point is, the story is fiction.  We read fiction to escape into another world unlike our own.  Seems as if too many people have taken this story too seriously.  Give it a rest already.  Move on.

                  I wish that were the case. Sadly, I have heard of women who have dumped their boyfriends because they couldn't be more like Edward.

                I've read the first book to see what all the commotion was about, and frankly, I did not find aspect of the book to be appealing. In addition to what you've written about in your article, the way it was written was atrocious; there was no plotline until the 400th page, there were many, many grammatical errors, and Meyer could not stop mentioning the words "rock hard" or "pale" on every single page. In addition, I found the characters to be very poorly developed as both Bella and Edward were complete Mary/Gary Sues. I found Bella to be very annoying and quite bitchy to her friends. There was one particular instance that really annoyed me  when Bella calls Mike a "dog" because he liked her and would follow her around and be nice to her. A DOG.

                I remember growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel (spin-off of BtVS). Having just finished watching all 7 seasons of Buffy again, I realized how much I adore Joss Whedon for creating female characters who are strong and independent. Buffy also had a relationship a vampire (with a soul), but (SPOILER ALERT) she also ends it by sending him to hell in order to save the world. When Angel comes back to earth but leaves her again because he knows the relationship isn't healthy for them, Buffy does not curl up in the fetal position to die or jump off a cliff. She dealt with the pain of losing him and she goes on to save the world a few more times. Even after her second boyfriend, whom she also loved very dearly, left her, she moved on. In one episode, where her sister almost kills herself for a boy, she says, "No guy is ever worth your life." That is the kind of person I look up to, and that is exactly the type of person who young girls should look up to. Not this Bella Swan character, who has no brain of her own.

                  Don't you think that Bella could have at least thought of saving Charlie too? I don't think she cared very much for her father at all because by going away, she left her scent, leaving Charlie there as BAIT to Victoria. If anything, I don't even think that she would go to her own father's funeral if he had died because of her. She probably wouldn't even shed a tear.

                    Victoria didnt care about Charlie, and she made sure there werewolves there to protect him. She is always taking care of him and worrying about him, and never used him as bait. She makes sure hes safe and when she becomes a vampire shes prepared to never see him again if its too dangerous.

                My issue isnt with Edward being a stalker or Bella being weak, its Bellas constant belief that Edward is better than her, that he is doing her a favour by being with her. I just dont think the emphasis on beauty is rightlike she doesnt deserve to be with him because hes so beautiful. Plus the general way women here fold themselves to accomodate men and their issues. Sam doesnt want people to stare at Emily after he rips half her face off? And Emily stays as the docile obedient fiancee cooking truckloads of food whiile Sam tells people not to look at her? I just dont like the way women in the series are portrayed as making themselves smaller to accomodate the men.

                Three words: Read Terry Pratchett. His books are the PERFECT antedote to Twilight. There are plenty of brilliant female characters in his books who aren't total drips.

                  She manages to get werewolves and vampire to do absolutely everything on her terms, despite the fact they could kill her by sneezing too hard, she ends up with everything she wants, and she does have interests and hobbies that arent shown in the movies. She isnt a perfect role model by any means, but shes definitely deeper than that.

                Great article, but I'd like to say I'm a 13 year old who HATES Twilight.

               <p>
                My guy friends where listening to me talk to the Twi-Hards, and they agree.
               </p>
               <p>
                I told them a ton of stuff wrong with Twilight, than I said:
               </p>
               <p>
                "So why do girls like Twilight? Simple. Bella has no personality, so it's easy for them to, sometimes unconsciously, take out Bella and add themselves in."
               </p>
               <p>
                Then I said some other stuff. The girls where just like: O.O.

                There's something that should be kept in mind while dissecting the Twilight Saga (although I don't think it would blunt the effect that much).  Bella is supposed to be a hollow placeholder for other teenage girls to insert their own personalities into.

                Haven't read the books or seen the film &amp; never will. What a pile of tosh, Meyer obviously is exploiting or actually is one of those type of women who are totally dependent on men  emotionally, literally, figuratively. Bella &amp; probably Kristen too is a quivering jelly mess of completely useless estrogen, a Narcissistic homage to young male wank fantasies &amp; young pubescent female self obsession syndrome idolatry, no wonder the feminist brigade is up in arms. Bella is nothing more than a stampeding clitoris on legs &amp; pouting lips.  Young girls who like this crap will hopefully grow out of this hormone charged emo phase &amp; become self assured young women who are dependent on themselves &amp; will hopefully only choose a male partner who has the same self assuredness. Unfortunately, the women who worship this twisted dependence psychology are often the ones who choose misogynist male sociopaths as partners, who allow themselves &amp; their offspring to be beaten to a pulp, brutalized, raped &amp; psychologically tormented but will not leave because they are besotted &amp; masochistic, they have to have 'that man'.   This kind of woman is a feeble entity that should be bred out of existence &amp; the men that prey on them are the real vampires

                I think people are forgetting it is only a book and film, I have never watched or read it but if people enjoy it let them enjoy it. I understand everyone is entitled to their opinions but at the end of the day its just a film and if you dont like it or agree with its messages simply don't watch it.

                I think Bella's somewhat "weak and submissive" character is a direct result of todays women being a little sick of feminism. Just like the mass exidus of women from the workplace which has been happening in the last few years, women returning home to be stay at home moms and homemakers. Not because of some bar set by society, but by choice. We know we can do anything a man can do and maybe alot more, we just realize now that we don't have to keep proving it.  Feminism prevailed, and now we have stepped beyond it. Now we can stop trying to do everything, and do what we really want. For some of us, that means being nurturers to our children and good wives to our husbands. Both jobs that require alot of strength.
               </p>
               <p>
                Many of us are tired of taking the lead and being the strong one, the protector and provider. A man like Edward, to some degree, would a welcome change to the weak men feminism has created (sons of hardworking single moms who without a male role model where coddled too much and expect their women to do the same). Many of us would love for a guy to open the door for us once in a while, pick up the check, take our coat, protect us from harm. Its not because we cant do it ourselves.

                First, I read all the books before the movies ever came out. Second, I'm a girl-geek tomboy from hell, and have always understood girlie-girls much better than I ever have backstabbing, self-important snot-bitches. Third, I watched in utter disgust as women killed the Equal Rights Amendment because they did not want truly equal rights with men, and the attendant equal responsibilities.

               <p>
                That said, Bella is a girlie-girl. She's also the type of uncoordinated klutz who can trip on a nickel and break her wrist. In the books, she always has some minor injury from this. As she tells someone, it does her no good to run, since a 5yo could catch her and beat her up. This informs her entire personality. She is utterly fearless, because being afraid is a waste of time. None of this is very well portrayed in the movies.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, she uses and abuses Jacob's affections and ditches her friends for a boy. So do most teenage girls. They're teenagers and thus self-absorbed. Yes, she at first knows nothing about mechanics. Then she rebuilt those bikes with Jacob's coaching and learned to ride them. Again, the movies screwed this up, because in the books, she continued to ride them after her accident.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is Bella admirable in all ways? Hell, no. But then, who is? Is she a character that I can see as a person doing things that she wants to do? Yes. Not the decisions I'd have made (Team Jacob!), but right for her.

                The "anti-feminism" rantings I've seen here deny the aspect of feminism that says that a woman should be WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO BE. Whether that be a physicist, a neurosurgeon, a fighter pilot, a martial arts competitor, a business mogul, a cop, a nurse, a therapist, a "human resources" sneering snip, or a housewife. All of you demanding that every woman MUST fit inside your restrictive little pigeon-hole of "proper feminist" are as bad as the patriarchal jerks who caused the invention of feminism.

                  Your argument hinges on the issue of choice.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If this was a real person, that truly existed, then what you are saying is completely correct; those of us- in this case, me- who are lambasting Bella as unfeminist are being restrictive. However, Bella is not a real person; Bella is a character in a novel, and as such her reactions to certain things are contrived by Stephanie Meyer to achieve different forms. For example, with Edward watching her sleep, any- and every- girl should be absolutely more horrified of his invasion of her privacy than Bella is. When Edward leaves Forkes, and goes through her things to remove things that will remind her of him, she should be beyond angry for what equates both to thievery and trespass. When Edward removes the car from her engine, so that she cannot visit Jacob, he is being more a parent than a boyfriend, and that is something left over from Victorian England and extreme patriarchy.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The issue here, something you've missed, is that Bella didn't make those choices, Stephanie Meyer did; hence the argument the author is evincing. To tell us that we, by disapproving of the author's choices, are being antifeminist is a little childish; it feels like the rant of a three year old, crying for their rattle back. We have taken something from you here; what, exactly? The enjoyment of trash fiction? There's plenty of it online, of you want to look. It is only because Twilight is so widespread that we question it's theme, and dislike its main character and her portrail of feminine love.

                Calling this a "nightmare to feminism" is a bit exaggerated.
                <br/>
                "Typically when you think of women being objectified in film it has to do with sex or nudity. In this case it has to do with both Edward and Jacobs constant coddling of Bella. Its as if shes a fragile flower who always has to be protected"
                <br/>
                Bella is protected and sheltered all the time more because of her humanity than her gender. She was physically in danger and she needed to be protected not because she's a woman but because she's a human. Humans are portrayed by the misanthropic author (Meyer) as fragile and helpless, not women. Do Alice, Rosalie, Victoria, or Jane need to be protected all the time?
               </p>
               <p>
                "In New Moon when he takes a leave of absence whats a girl to do? Find something in them self? NO! Find another man!  Enter Jacob, another troubled male figure who helps her cope with her loss and then leaves her hanging."
                <br/>
                In New Moon Bella actually dealt with the depression a lot better than Edward did. Edward curled up in a ball and did nothing for 7 months, whereas Bella tried to overcome the depression, though she failed she at least put in an effort. When Bella is changed into a vampire, she's on equal grounds with Edward physically and isn't always protected. I don't think your points are wrong, but this is just the other side of the argument.
               </p>
               <p>
                "She has no identity of her own, and literally loses her mind without the constant influence of vampire boy. At the end of Twilight, when Edward attempts to leave her in the hospital, she almost gives herself a stroke. Again in New Moon, when he tells her he has to go (because hes a danger to her), shes shown on the ground in the fetal position, looking a junkie whose about to kill herself."
                <br/>
                Jacob fell into a state of depression when Bella married Edward, and Edward curled up into a ball for 7 months, fed off rats, and tried to kill himself without Bella. I don't think its Bella without a sense of identity, I think all of these characters lack depth.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Bella isnt a strong character and shouldnt be revered for her behavior in these films. Shes nothing more than a shadow for a man rather than a pillar for herself and not only is that dangerous but its a discouraging message to send to girls."
                <br/>
                So the point of these books to tell a story or to show the ideal role model?
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyways, I don't find Twilight a "nightmare" to feminism, it's definitely misanthropic but not misogynistic. The point of feminism is to give women equality right? To view women as equal to men. If you tell a woman she can't do something because she's a woman, then that's sexist and "anti-feminist." Bella made the choice to be a mother and a wife and to not go to college, no one forced her into anything. In fact, Edward constantly asked her to apply to more schools, and experience her life as a human instead of giving up her mortality. Bella chose to be what she is, she's not a role model, she's just making her choices for her.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Rosalie and Alice's origin stories both involve them being victimised by men, and both being utterly unable to avoid it; in Rosalie's case, she was gifted with vampirism by a man, as was Alice. Jane is a character ruled over by a man; Victoria goes berzerk when Edward kills her man. In EACH of these situations men are portrayed as being greater/more powerful than women.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is reasonable to respect a real person's choices, but a character in a novel so wide spread cannot be held up as real; therefore, we can most definately question why the author chose- not the character, Stephanie Meyer- to make Bella so utter anodyne and anemic, and so willing to relinquish herself for what is the possiblility of being an eternal teenager with a hollywood teen hearthrob. Bella is a nightmare to feminism, because she makes it attractive to young women to subsume their own desires completely in order to attract a man who is so effortlessly wealthy/good at everything that no matter what she cannot compete or compare? And that is just the first step; not only does she lack character outside of her relationships with men, when in them she assumes half their character for her own; she is different with Jacob then with Edward.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In short, the book and movie series is- in addition to being poorly written- to the severe detriment of young women who grow up thinking that Bella's expectations are realistic, and are the complete antithesis of true feminism.

                Hello There, well I agree that, Bella is not a rolemodel for feminism, but you shouldnt write an article with so many wrong facts on the movie/books. Even if you havent read the books, some research before you intent to write an article about it woud be really nice. I actually was hoping to use your article for my essay about feminism in the vampire genre, now I cant because of all the mistakes
                <img alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://screencrave.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
                 First of all: Up to the beginning of the story she lives with her mother and hasnt been in any need of a father! Second Edward CANT reat her mindhello? thats whats faszinates him about hersorry, after that point I stopped reading, it was too frustrating. Sorry.

                Very true! Ive thought this about Twilight since the first time I read the book. The blatant anti-feminist themes throughout the entire series are outrageous, and I shake my head at the message Stephenie Meyer is sending out to young women. And worse, Meyer knows the audience for which she is writing (Young Adult) yet she continues with this ridiculous notion that Bella Swan is a mature, courageous character. If that is your definition of mature and courageous then you seriously require a reality check. As if Bellas complete lack of a personal identity isnt enough, her drug-addict like relationship towards Edward is simply disgusting, and difficult to read. Even after he abandons her randomly for months, she is willing to risk her life to attempt to save him, and once hes returned oh, everything is wonderful again! Were you gone? I dont even remember! Unrealistic, idealized garbage. I do have to say that Breaking Dawn was the epitome of anti-feminism in my mind. Question: WHY did Meyer make Bella a sex-crazed-maniac?! That made no sense to me. And the worst- the very worst thing that could have ever been done in the whole series was Bellas transformation into a vampire. I literally cringed when I realized Meyer was taking away Bellas humanity. I had hoped the entire series that she wouldnt. But of course, that is what Bella wants, that is what Bella gets!! It just seemed so incredibly wrong. That is your HUMANITY. Youre freaking 18, what do you know about life? Sure, Ill never see my family or friends again, Ill be at risk for hurting people and dependent on blood, and Ill never dieBut its worth it, for a guy! Dying is a part of life I would have SO much rather seen her live a full, wonderful human life and die in peace (even with Edward) than be transformed into a vampire. To me, that is much more romantic. Being with Edward literally took away her life. And she accepted it.
                <br/>
                The 3 book format of Breaking Dawn only got worse and worse with each book. Reading from Bellas perspective as a vampire was horrible. Her relatablity as a character (if there even was any to begin with) was gone. Her- and everyone around her who she cared about- lived in a perfect utopia. Stephenie Meyer betrayed her own fantasy world. Where is the crazed, blood-thirsty new born vampire we were promised? Where is the showdown with the Volturi that has been anticipated? Nowhere to be found. There was a TOTAL lack of creativity. I was expecting deaths, loss, grief, hard decisions, compromises, unexpected twists But what I got was a delusional author who was more concerned with giving her characters a happy every after rather than paying attention to realistic issues and consequences that occur in hard situations. Overall, a total letdown. And while I saw redeeming qualities in the first 3 books, Breaking Dawn only draws attention to the negative, unoriginal, difficult-to-stand aspects of the series and spoiled the whole Twilight universe for me. I encourage every person, young girls in particular, to view Bella Swan as a weak, uninspired, one-dimensional character who goes against everything that represents a strong, brave, sacrificing female and who exists only in Meyers narrow, corny, sad attempt at a real piece of literature. I implore you, young womenif you desire a real heroine, read Jane Eyre or something similar. That is all.

                To be fair, Edward never asks Bella to become a vampire or leave her family, shes the one who wants to live forever with him. Thirteen year-old girls arent stupid, they can distinguish between fiction and reality, and its ridiculous to suggest that they cant. Yes, Bellas reaction to his leaving is terrible, Ill agree to that. She needs protecting because her best friends a werewolf and her boyfriend is a vampire-she leads a pretty dangerous life. She lives with her Dad because thats what teenagers do, and she chooses to be there to give her Mum some freedom. In those books humans have no defences against vampires, so she cant fight them by herself. The films dont do her justice-in the books she likes to read, she likes music, and shes good at biology. She has interests and friends, but its a romance series, so of course shell be thinking of her boyfriend most of the time-so are most teenage girls. Im not saying shes the perfect role model, but the original character portrayed in the books isnt actually that bad-she makes decisions and she makes sure other people stick to her plans. That might not be kind or even sensible at times, but she makes choices and she knows what she wants-shes a strong woman in her own way.
