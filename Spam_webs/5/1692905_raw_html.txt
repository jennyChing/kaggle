    Background
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Silicone heater blankets were developed by NASA research to
keep the insulated walls of satellites warm so that the enclosed
instruments could function. They are now used in many applications
like heat forming of flat sheet plastics and heat tracing of pipes.
In the Spring issue #25 of the American Lutherie, Mike Keller
describes how he uses the heating blankets for heating and bending
guitar sides. He also mentions an earlier article in Fine Woodworking
for bending wood with the blanket. The potential for use of these
devices in violin making became obvious to me. I investigated
alternate sources of the blankets, their comparative cost, and
with some experimentation and adaptation, developed specific applications
for violin making. I shall demonstrate today the process of bending
violin ribs, the bout, lining, purfling, and how to remove the
most stubborn glued violin neck, quite easily. The techniques
are applicable to viola, cello, and bass making, as well as viola
de gamba, dulcimers and other stringed instruments. I shall also
show you how you can use the silicone blanket for heating bows
prior to bending or re-bending. I shall also suggest how the process
could be furher adapted to other luthier operations.

   <i>
    The materials used, and sources.
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   The silicone heater blankets are available from two sources,
with a number of standard sizes in stock at each company:
  </p>
  <p>
   The WATLOW ELECTRIC MANUFACTURING COMPANY, 12001 Lackland Road,
St. Louis, MO 63146, (314) 878-4600.
  </p>
  <p>
   Watlow markets through distributors. It has a large selection
of stock size heaters, up to 35" long. The prices are available
only from the distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   BENCHMARK THERMAL, 13185 Nevada City Ave., Grass Valley, CA
95945, (530) 477-5011, FAX (530) 477-6507
  </p>
  <p>
   Benchmark has a smaller stock size selection, but their prices
are considerably cheaper. They will make any size you wish, but
that adds to the cost and delivery time. The stock maximum length
is 20", but this is more than long enough for violins. In
bending bass ribs, I use two 10" wide blankets for the longer
pieces, and only one for the center bout. The best units are 4
Watts per square inch, rather than the 2 Watt model. This type
will get up to 50
   <img align="LEFT" border="0" height="200" naturalsizeflag="0" src="BLANKY.GIF" width="350"/>
   0 degrees F in a couple
of minutes. Product catalogs are available which list the various
sizes. Both of these companies also sell temperature controllers.
They are, however, expensive. You can use a light dimmer on the
smaller units to reduce, (but not control) the heat. There are
other devices like rheostats that can be used provided they are
rated high enough. You could use a simple snap disc thermostatic
switch from W.W. Grainger, # 4E120, for $13.39, but it cycles
on at 210 degrees, and off at 250 degrees F. This may be good
for some low temperature applications. The snap disc unit will
have to be attached to the metal liner at some mid point in order
to detect the average temperature. The snap disc unit is rated
at 10 Amps. My experimentation was done without the thermostatic
controller. I used the blanket directly powered through a 14/3
grounded power cord plugged into a ground fault outlet. I also
have two "Powerstat" variable transformers rated at
7.5 and 10.0 Amps, so either is good to use to lower, (but not
regulate) the temperature.

    Selection of heater blanket
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   For violins and violas, I use: BF-2479, 2" x 18",
144 Watts, 1.25A, 115 VAC. About $19.00. For cellos, I use BF-2481,
5" x 20", 400 Watts, 3.47A, 115 VAC. About $39.00. For
basses, I use BF-2480, 10" x 12", 480 Watts, 4.17A,
115 VAC, about $46.00, used in the bout area, and combined with
the BF-2307, 10" x 18", 720 Watts, 6.76A, 115 VAC, to
bend the bottom of the corpus. About $65.00. All of the numbers
are for the Benchmark units. Other stock sizes are available.
The blankets come with 12" leads, and are 0.055" thick.
The heating grid is traced through the entire blanket, and gets
very hot almost instantly. You MUST use a ground fault outlet
in your power outlet. This is cheap insurance to prevent electrical
shock. It costs about $15.00 at any hardware store, or buy from
W.W.Grainger stores. # 3A391, 20 Amp, $14.60. SAFETY FIRST!

    Making the inside mold
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   You will need your standard inside mold, or make a special
mold of plywood for each model. The advantage is that you can
switch from one style and size to another using the same blanket.
I used either my existing corpus mold, or retrofitted an old unused
inside mold which I sanded down in size to accommodate the 0.02"
metal, plus 0.055" heating blanket, plus the thickness of
the ribs. The bending surface has a thin sheet metal cover which
distributes the heat evenly. My demonstration equipment uses both
aluminum and brass on the violin mold, and stainless steel on
the bass mold. The thickness should be 0.02" or thinner.
Stainless steel is harder to bend, but will not stain, and lasts
forever. I should mention that you can glue the silicone blanket
down to the metal heat sink on the mold, or the mold itself, using
the cement available from both suppliers. It is the RTV 732 from
Dow Corning, and is 100% silicone rubber, good up to 450 degrees
F. Be aware that, once the RTV cures, there is no way that you
will be able to remove it short of cutting it off. We use it in
manufacturing to glue in gaskets and bind parts of dissimilar
materials. It really holds! It may be practical to glue the heating
tape to the stainless steel and use that as the "mobile"
heating assembly to different mold forms.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Procedure
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   The mold is prepared by covering the curved surface with the
metal strip. The blanket then goes against the metal surface.
The ribs are then bent over the blanket, and clamped down using
a form fitting block. You could change the sequence and bend by
placing the wood over the metal mold with the heating blanket
next. There does not seem to be much difference in the sequence,
as the results come out the same. You can use the same mold as
your corpus mold, but you will note that the bent ribs will be
slightly greater in curvature on the upper and lower bout, and
slightly less on the "C" bout. It will still be better
than the results of the old bending iron. To be exact, you can
compensate for the thickness of the metal surface and the wood
thickness, and if the blanket is inside, add the thickness of
the blanket. My suggestion is to have the blanket on the inside,
so the clamping frame does not stretch the heating element and
separate it. The wood is prepared as follows: Cut the ribs as
you would normally do, sanded to the proper thickness. From 1.5
mm for violins to 2.5-3.0 for basses. The blanket for the violin
is 2" wide, so you have room to operate. Soak the wood for
15-20 minutes in hot water, or in hot water with 1% by volume,
of household ammonia added (only ammonia, no soaps or other additives).
The ammonia will soften the ridged cellulose cells allowing them
bend without fracturing. Use the ammoniated water in a well ventilated
area. When the wood is heated, the water evaporates, and the ammonia
comes off as a gas. The cellulose becomes rigid again in its new
shape, all stress free. Place the wet ribs over the heating blanketed
mold and turn the blanket on. The heat will start immediately
and the ribs will start to steam and bend. DO NOT FORCE THE BENDING
PROCESS. The ribs will bend quite well by themselves when they
are hot enough, with only a little pressure to hold it against
the blanket. Since the wood gets very hot, use a form mold to
clamp the bent wood against the ribs. You will not be able to
use your hands. On outside curves, you can weight the loose unclamped
end with a heavy spring clamp, and the weight will gradually pull
the wood in contact with the blanket. This actually goes very
fast. I also use a wood block to guide the bending process on
the upper and lower bouts. There is a chance that the wood will
get very hot and start to bake if you take too long to do the
bending. You can forestall this if you simply wet the wood if
it gets too dry. In any case, you should be done in 10 minutes
at most. When you have the ribs bent, turn the power off on the
blanket and let the balance of the water evaporate out by the
residual heat for 15-20 minutes and let the mold cool down. If
you do not use the ribs right away and they open up, you can re-heat
them up for a couple of minutes by just placing it back in the
mold and turning the heat. Most of my corpus molds are made from
multi-layered plywood, which is of course glued. If you heat the
rib mold for a prolonged time, the glue softens and melts. This
could cause the mold to de-laminate. It may be best to use solid
wood for high production operations where parts are bent one after
the other. There are many ways to clamp the ribs to the mold during
the bending process. You will need a curved block clamp in the
"C" bout that fits well. Also one in the sharp curve
of the top and bottom bout. Most of these curved clamps you now
use in your conventional gluing process will work. I like the
rod, eye bolt with wing nut, and wood block, holding clamp that
is easy to apply, especially on the larger instruments.

   <i>
    Other applications of the heating blanket
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   The beauty of the silicone blanket is that you can use it for
many other processes in violin making. Among these are:
  </p>
  <p>
   1) Removal of old fingerboards Apply the heating blanket to
the fingerboard for 5-8 minutes. Insert a spatula at the rear
joint, and the board should pop right off.
  </p>
  <p>
   2) Heating the plates prior to applying heated hide glue. This
will keep the glue liquid longer.
  </p>
  <p>
   3) Bending the plates before gluing. Cellos, and particularly
basses, have the plates bent at the upper bout. I make an angled
ramp that duplicates the desired bend, plus 5 degrees overbend.
This compensates for snapback when unclamped. Clamp the main plate
edges down to the board with the bend line at the edge of the
ramp. Now lay the heating blanket on the bending line. Turn on
the power and heat the area well. Gradually push the plate down
to meet the ramped incline. Clamp down the edges. Remove the blanket
and allow to cool.
  </p>
  <p>
   4) Bending and rebending bows. A major prpblem in bow making
is the proess of bending the bow after you make it or rebending
after the curve becomes fatigued from use. The 2" wide blanket
when "clothes pin clamped" around the bow will apply
even heat in the whole area to be bent. When hot enough, the bow
can be set in a set curved form to cool while in the proper bend
curvature. This eliminates the alcohol lamp and scorched wood
with its uneven heat.
  </p>
  <p>
   5) Bent plate forming. WIliam Fulton gave a presentation at
the 1990 SCAVM symposium, and has published the technique of bending
flat thin plates to form the curved surface of a violin plate.
The plates are then carved in the conventional maner He used a
tank of boiling water and a special clamp and wedges to spread
the wood apart Instead of the tank of water, you could use a silicone
blanket to apply heat over the whole area and on both sides at
once. The wet ammoniated wood could also be sandwiched between
two blankets to first soften before clamping in the edge form.
Heat can be applied continually to each side while the wedges
are inserted to spread the wood apart, and kept there until the
bend is complete. It will also help dry the plates out much faster
than air drying. The plate bending process could now be applied
to the larger instruments like the cello, or even a bass, without
having a huge boiling tank.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have not applied the blanket to a varnished instrument, as
I believe it would cook and lift the varnish. I suppose that if
you used a heat controller, you could apply the heat very slowly
to loosen a glue joint. I would not have the courage to try this
on a valuable instrument.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    Conclusions
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p>
   The use of the silicone blanket in stringed instruments is
limited only by the imagination. It is inexpensive to buy and
use, and can be adapted to existing forms and clamps now in use
by the maker. It should also be a great boon to the larger violin
making companies, that produce a large number of instruments,
as it is a process conducive to high production of bent parts.
A significant advantage of the blankets is that they can be used
for many
different models and sizes of instruments by simply changing the
underlying mold. The procedures outlined in this paper and talk
will be easy to adapt to the processes now used by violin makers
and repairers. I predict
that it will be in standard usage in a very few years.
