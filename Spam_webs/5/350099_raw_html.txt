        Cladwell respects your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Website Visitors
       </h2>
       <p>
        Like most website operators, Cladwell collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cladwells purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cladwells visitors use its website. From time to time, Cladwell may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cladwell also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Cladwell only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
       </h2>
       <p>
        Certain visitors to Cladwells websites choose to interact with Cladwell in ways that require Cladwell to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cladwell gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors at Cladwell.com to provide an email address, body type details, and information regarding frequency of dressing in a certain manner or style.  Cladwell does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Aggregated Statistics
       </h2>
       <p>
        Cladwell may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Cladwell may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Cladwell does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
       </h2>
       <p>
        Cladwell discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Cladwells behalf or to provide services available at Cladwells websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Cladwells websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cladwell will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Cladwell discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Cladwell believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cladwell, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Cladwell website and have supplied your email address, Cladwell may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Cladwell and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it with prior notification to the requestor in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cladwell takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
