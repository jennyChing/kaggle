       both recommend starting at age 20. A breast exam at your age is just your doctor or clinician feeling your boobs to see if theres anything that seems unusual. Usually this person is your gynecological practionerand if youre past puberty and/or sexually active, you should have one of those. If youre in the U.S.,

       </a>
       , the United States Preventative Health Taskforce changed its guidelines to recommend against breast self-exam entirely. But guidelines from other organizations, like the American Cancer Society, still recommend it, but only as an optional method for checking innot to find something, but so that youll know your own enough to notice if anything changes. If you do want to learn how to do it, heres an adaptation of the

       from the American Cancer Society (ACS):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Lie down with your right arm above your head in a dramatic faint position, like you were born into a culture that invalidates all feminine emotional expression as hysteria! Haha thats nobody reading this, I know.
       </li>
       <li>
        Take the middle three fingers of your left hand and place the fingertips just inside your right armpit, up near your collarbone.
       </li>
       <li>
        Press your finger pads down and move them in a circular motion at three levels: light pressure to feel the tissue closest to the skin, in the ACSs words; medium pressure to feel a little deeper; and firm pressure to feel the tissue closest to the chest and ribs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Repeat, moving in a vertical line with a little overlap to cover everything. I call this move mowing the lawn, but I am open to suggestions. Go as far up as your collarbone, as far down as your bra line, and as far out as the middle of your armpits.
       </li>
       <li>
        Switch the arm behind your head to your left, and repeat on the opposite side.
       </li>
       <li>
        Take a break to enjoy a refreshing beverage.
       </li>
       <li>
        Stand up, face a mirror, and press your hands on your hips like
        <em>
         serious business

        , looking for, per the ACSRaise your right arm slightly and feel around your armpit. Switch and repeat.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       What are you feeling for, exactly? Healthy breast tissue feels like the tops of broccoli when you press down on it. Since many people are visual learners, Ive decided to go there.

       People under the age of 25 have a ridiculously, ridiculously low rate of breast cancer (like, less than 1%). What are common in young women, though, are conditions that are considered benign breast disease, which is kind of a dumb name, because
       <em>
        disease
       </em>
       suggests something harmful and scary, and what were talking about here are basically boob zits. For teenagers, the most common kinds of these are fibroadenomas, fibrocystic changes/cysts, and infections like mastitis or abscesses. Most of you have never heard of any of those conditions, even though theyre incredibly commonand theyre feeling kind of resentful about it, because, what, do they have to be mean like cancer to get us to pay attention to them? OK, fine. Listening. In order of popularity:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Fibroadenomas:
        </strong>
        Fibroadenomas are the #1 breast lump AND the #1 breast lump that is going to make you think you have cancer! Three-quarters of all breast lumps found in teenagers are fibroadenomas. They are usually round and feel solid, firm, or rubbery: aka exactly like youd think cancer would feel. They seem to come out of nowhere, and usually grow to the size of a grape and then stay that size, shrink, or
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1497021/" target="_blank">
         go away completely
        </a>
        . Fibroadenomas are almost never painful, but can be tender around your period, especially if theyre larger.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Cysts:
        </strong>
        About half of all the boobs in the world, if you really get in there and mush around, have a kind of ropy texturesorta like a bunch of tiny beads all up in there. This type of texture has been called fibrocystic breast changes or fibrocystic breasts, because these breasts are more likely to develop cysts.
        <a href="http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/TherapeuticCenters/BreastCancer.aspx?ChunkID=14694" target="_blank">
         Here
        </a>
        is an unforgettably vivid explanation of a cyst: A fluid-filled sac that is usually smooth, firm, movable, and sometimes tender like a water balloon without the water [They] generally increase in size before the menstrual period and decrease afterwards. A large cyst may be round and feel a bit like an eyeball when pressed with the eyelid closed. Whee! My doctor friend tells her patients: Sometimes boobs are lumpywhatever. Everyones boobs are at least a little lumpy. Some are lumpier than others. Check your boobs out every once in a while and see if they get lumpier over time, or if a single lump gets weird or anything. Read more about cysts and fibrocystic breast changes

         Infections  and abscesses:
        </strong>
        These are are pretty rare, and theyre usually preceded by a cause: breast trauma (e.g., soccer ball to the chest) is one. Another is nipple piercing: 10-20% of nipple piercings

        will help prevent this from happening. Smoking cigarettes also puts you at higher risk for developing infections. Symptoms of an infection or abscess include breast tenderness, pain, heat, redness, swelling, and whole-body symptoms like chills and fever. This is something you should really get checked out! The first treatment is antibiotics, but in more serious cases the abscess may need to be drained surgically.

          Eep. I am so proud of having boobs. That sounds funny. I actually got a new dress yesterday, and I look like super huge boobs in it. :DD

          Cant stress how useful this article is, certainly saves me trying to discreetly peer at friends boobs to figure out if mine are normal or not!

          I found a lump in my breast about two months ago and went to the doctor who referred me for a consultation. Turns out was a fibroadenoma which as it says above is really common.
         </p>
         <p>
          Definitely recommend going to the doctor, because ignorance isnt bliss  before my consultation I totally freaked out cause obviously a lump equals cancer. Now Im more educated about my body and so relieved!

          Boobs: A Users Guide. Now thats what I call title! My bra size is a bit under the average for my age, but my super-tallness makes me look EXTRA-FLAT, so its hard to get to like them. My new uplifting phrase is right up there: Fuck it: its mine Thanks a lot, Lola :) &lt;3

          This article is revolutionary. The fact that you are addressing such a huge young readership and expressing  that body positivity, gender identity and emotional fortitude are all subject to individual agency is incredible. I am grabbing my tits with one hand and slow clapping you with the other.

          I dont just read Rookie because of the awesome &amp; informative content. I read Rookie because its HILARIOUS! Who knew an article about boobs could be so funny? (Okay, boobs can kinda be a funny thing, but still.) Awesome job, Lola. And I really love the super-scientific diagram of a broccoli boob.

          Ive had a lump in my breast for at least a year and its stressing me out now, mostly because I just had my yearly physical with a new doctor and I was cowardly/uncomfortable and didnt mention it.  I have a shot scheduled for May, but it might just be a nurse. There is absolutely ZERO chance I will ever tell my mom because I dont talk to her about anything and that works fine for me. I was going to send in a question to some site, maybe Rookie, these past few days, but was scared the answer would be: Tell your mom. Go to the doctor. Get a needle in your boob and find out youre fine.
         </p>
         <p>
          Im stressing, please help.

           Id maybe mention it to the nurse person.  You gotta realize that these people see lots of naked bodies and super gross things and stuff and they WILL NOT BE FAZED by boobs.  Seriously.  Theyll be professional and then its much less embarrassing (take it from someone who got into a loud argument about birth control with a pharmacist).  If you dont want to do that, talk to a trusted adult!  Oh my god, I sound like an advice column.  Your dad, if hes an option, would be fine.  Taking care of your kid is more important than EW BOOBS.  Or maybe an aunt/cousin/etc?  Even a family friend can at least help you figure out what to do!  Or one of your friends.  Its probably fine, and its probably just one of those ones they talked about that isnt harmful, but you still should check.  Even if its just for your peace of mind.

             This is all really funny to me now, because a bit after I wrote that comment, I found a lump in my breast!  Its a fibroadenoma, but a slightly worrisome one so theyre going to biopsy it.
             <br/>
             BUT THE POINT HERE is that now I can super officially tell you from personal experience that its not embarrassing at all.

           i agree with blythe. doctors and nurses see plenty of crazy things everyday and it is part of their job not to be fazed by it. i completely understand feeling awkward and uncomfortable about having someone look at and feel your boobs, but the setting is so clinical and any doctor or nurse will be so professional that it should barely feel any different than having them look down your throat or in your ear or do that knee tapping thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           chances are its one of the common and easily treatable things listed above so nothing to worry about, and needles wont even come into it!
          </p>
          <p>
           if you feel like you cant talk to your mum, then is there a school nurse you could chat to instead? any medical professional should treat anything you tell them as confidential so you could talk to your school nurse, or even your school counsellor without it becoming everybodys business. you dont even have to show them anything, just say look, im a bit worried about this thing and what would you advise because i feel very uncomfortable about telling my doctor or my parents.
          </p>
          <p>
           good luck!
          </p>

           Hi Maddy! *HUG* dont stress, its okay! basically, SAME HERE and i went to the doctors and it wasnt even awkward AT ALL like it doesnt take that long and she just poked about and said it was okay. Thatll probably be the same for you! I PROMISE it isnt bad. And youll feel so much better after, its like a weight off your chest! (LIKE MY PHRASING THERE? :D) Dont worry, buttercup. &lt;3 It's gonna be okay.

          OMG every time I read the comments from an article thingy, everyones like super glad youd touched on that subject and i never really got it, but after this boob one, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I actually have had a cyst(benign) for some like, a year or something(I got it checked out and stuff with the ultrasound and everything) and this has totally reassured me about not being the only teenage girl with one aha, so thank you!! :-)

          After this article I actually felt like hugging my boobs. Thank you, Rookie! Honestly, the fact that you talk about the female body so often and so comfortably is one of my favorite things about you guys. I cant count all the times I read an article regarding body issues and thinking OMG Im not the only one! Lots and lots of love

          I feel like there are a lot of misconceptions about boobs! Like that not wearing a bra will give you saggy boobs in the future or that wearing bras will give you cancer. And of course the fear of abnormality.
          <br/>
          So it's nice to have a really practical and open approach to the subject of our lovely body parts!

           I wonder if wearing the wrong size bra, like if it is too small, can affect you? If you cant afford to get new bras, I wonder how wearing a bra that is too small can affect your health? I also wondered if sleeping with your bra on is bad. I used to do that when I was in my early teens. Do u guys know? :~ /

           Ive always been self-conscious about my huge boobs. I used to want a reduction for that reason. I often felt like people over-sexualized me, and I hated the attention I got for them. Through the years I have learned how to handle that (often) negative attention, and begun to appreciate my body for the wonder that it is! However, it is encouraging to hear that insurance usually covers the surgery. I am still considering it for the future, because these days I have a lot of back problems. At a 32GG I think it should be justified haha! Morning Moon, your tits are fantastic. Dont let other peoples opinions impact the way you think of yourself!

            I think my mom is an H Rachel. She had a lot of the concerns you expressed. We are experiencing financial problems to some degree, and my mom complains about how expensive the bras are for the higher up letters. She even has to order hers from catalogs/online to get the ones that have special made straps for better support. They are as much as $60. The cheaper bras also leave friction scars around her shoulders. But dont get too frustrated. I think some women, like the writers at Rookie, and maybe some influential women/organizations are noticing these problems more and more and are taking steps to address it!

             Yes, the bras are VERY expensive, Amber. I am required to spend an average of $70 on each bra. I own two at a time: one sports bra, and one regular bra. I have to replace them on an average of every 5 months, because they wear out from the stress put on them. I have to go to a specialty store in my town (so grateful that we have one where I live.) Thank you for the encouragement. I am so glad that this is beginning to be addressed! And I love that girls arent so afraid to talk about stuff like this anymore.

          I dont know what youre on about, but ultrasounds do hurt!  Ive had to get my heart ultrasounded twice, and my heart is, ya know, under a boob.  Maybe it was because I was at a pediatric cardiologists place (Im 16) or maybe the guy doing it had never been near a boob before, but ow.  Obviously, you should get an ultrasound if you need it, but its probably going to be uncomfortable at the least.

          This is really good! I personally think there isnt much awareness given to teenagers, with good reason as well as bad, but Im glad that rookie has done this article! Thank you!

          This is so so very interesting, thank you Lola!
          <br/>
          Im also taking a look at the links, like the one about binding, and really admiring the community &amp; support for people who dont feel comfortable in their bodies and/or gender. (not very sure about which terms to use)

          BOOBS!
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to shout out to all the peeps having trouble talking about boobs- its okay. I was afraid to talk about my boobs for a long time, too. Only about a year ago I became really comfortable with &amp; talking about my boobs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Oh, if you dont like calling them boobs, give them a NAME. I call my boobs a variety of names, ranging from la ladies to boobage to titties. I found that when I talked about la ladies to my mom &amp; doctor, I was a lot more comfortable about it.

          The broccoli image is killing me! I had a cyst removed a couple years ago that I used to call my little corn. I became a little attached to it and even had them print out the ultrasound of it for me. Its on my mirror :D

          Once again, thank you for addressing the important topic of breasts.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am still coming to terms with mine, but its so good to know that others have done it and have learned to feel fine.
          <br/>
          I still think the biggest part of the solution to breast discomfort (not physical discomfort- thats a different problem) would be for people to stop being so weird about female breasts.
          <br/>
          People need to stop making dumb remarks and jokes about peoples bodies. It just feels terrible, and sometimes they dont even realize what theyre doing because its considered such a normal and ok thing to do.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thanks again Rookie for being honest and supportive c:

          One time when I was in middle school, a girl told me I was going to hate having big boobs and that she was so lucky to have small boobs because my back was always going to hurt and hers wouldnt. In fact, we have nearly the same boob size now, and neither of us have backaches over our boobs. So, fuck it and enjoy your tits ladies.

          Hey Rookies,
         </p>
         <p>
          Long time reader, first time commenter. I cannot tell you how crucial the part you guys are playing in opening the conversation on womens issues, be it dealing with the male gaze to this very approachable, Your boobs and You guide.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thats why I wanted to tell you (and your readers) about a rare, aggressive, and often misdiagnosed form of breast cancer that not many women know about called Inflammatory Breast Cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Often misdiagnosed as a rash, IBC will not wait until youre in your forties. There are cases of teenagers dying from this disease because they didnt know what it was and in some cases, were too embarrassed to ask for help.
         </p>
         <p>
          Common symptoms include a bumpy rash that resembles an orange peel, an inverted nipple, discoloration (red or bruised appearance) and an increase in size of the infected breast.
         </p>
         <p>
          Please take the time to educate yourselves. Cancer.org has a good introductory page dedicated to IBC that is really clear about how to spot it, survival rates, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
          Much love to your and your boobs,
          <br/>
          Natalie
         </p>

          also, its cool to see rookie move towards being trans~friendly. when i saw the name of the article i thought that it would be only about assigned-at-birth-girls but no  all those callouts have been slowly molding rookie to one of the safest places online. YAY.

          Great article! The only thing Id add is that you talk about making your boobs smaller with binding or surgery, but you only offer surgery as an option for making them bigger. but there are some pretty awesome +2 size bras etc out there- they obviously cant make them 5 times bigger but theyre pretty effective!

          hi, im a guy from brazil, and i love this post, lola you are so funny! my right boob start growing, just the right one! My doctor says that Im with excess estrogen. Its a big change in my body that Im accepting with open arms and mind and Im loving it. I intend to go to the doctor now to control estrogen so nothing bad happens but I want them (or just the right one) grow. Ive even made some pictures to send to you, photos of my first bra. soon I will send to you.  w love xx

          Actually, breastfeeding after breast surgery is possible, even in the case of top surgery. Check out Trevors amazing story of breastfeeding his son:

          I am not questioning any individuals decision to NOT reproduce or breastfeed, but couldnt let that common assumption go unchallenged!

          Great article!
          <br/>
          So Im actually a gynecological teaching associate (GTA), which means I use my own body to teach med students to give breast and pelvic exams. Basically I spend a ton of time talking and thinking about this stuff. The only things I would add are that, first, 98% of malignant tumors are initially found by women themselves, so despite the new recommendations its best to keep doing self-exams. Also (did you mention this? I may have missed it), you want to do the exam at the same time every month, 3-4 days after you START your period. Thats the point of your cycle with the least tenderness and fewest fibrocystic changes, and you want to do it at the same time so you dont freak yourself out about a lump that is actually a totally normal monthly change.
          <br/>
          Yay self-exams! I recommend doing a self-pelvic too, if possible; its very exciting to see your cervix for the first time! If you have an OBGYN you can ask to hold a hand mirror during your regular check up so you can see whats going on, and learn whats normal for you.
         </p>

          Comment on the last paragraphs: a properly-fitted bra can make all the difference. When you get the proportions right, a DD cup is not big.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yup. Not a typo there. A proper DD cup is on the small, dainty end. Its what most people would think of as an A or B cup.
         </p>
         <p>
          More and more bra-makers are going up to a K cup. I used to wear a DD cup, because it was the only thing I could find to go over my medium-lookin boobs. The problem there was that I was wearing a DD cup made for a band that was much too loose for me. When I got the band tight enough to stop riding up my back, I needed to readjust the proportions. Now I wear anything from a 28FF to 28GG. My boobs still look medium. Theyre much more lifted, though, and my shoulders dont hurt any more.
         </p>
         <p>
          So, as far as bras go, research how to get them fitting properly, and above all, dont assume the cup size range stops at DD.
         </p>

          Can I just add something?
         </p>
         <p>
          I really feel like this owners guide is not complete without an explicit utterance of YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT A BRA.
         </p>
         <p>
          Seriously, I understand it isnt for everyone, but I have what I like to call portable boobs, small enough to go around with carefree, and I really wish someone had told me sooner that no, nipples are not ugly or indecent, and that there was no need to use those things in order to appear to have smooth, nipple-less, perfectly round globes on my chest, instead of my own pointy pair.
         </p>
         <p>
          I hated bras, never felt comfortable or free in them, but I felt sure I would be shunned if I ditched them. And then I did anyway and now, quite literally, feel 5838 times better about my body.
         </p>
         <p>
          Life without a bra is wonderful for me, so I really hope anyone else in my old situation can be made aware that bralessness is totally an option!
