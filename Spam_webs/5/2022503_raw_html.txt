   The Zetas have always asserted that the Sun dominated the solar system's magnetic field, and did not flip its poles every 11 years as NASA has asserted. The 
Zetas stated that the Sun's influence reached to the end of the solar system, and that a magnetic influence affecting the solar system came from beyond the solar 
system, triggering what the Zetas called the Magnetic Trimesters.

       Magnetic influences between planets are greater than humans imagine, because they use as their frame of reference objects on the 
surface. The Earth's crust is magnetically diffuse, representing many different pole alliances over the eons, as magma hardened after 
volcanic eruptions during pole shifts. The Earth's thick crust acts as a shield in this way, so that only sensitive needles on compasses, 
floating freely, jiggle into alignment with the Earth's core. A planet's magnetic influence is not encapsulated by its crust, but reaches 
beyond this even to the ends of the solar system.

       When this path of least resistance is established in a gaseous planet, the magnetic particle flow takes a short cut to the south pole of the 
Sun, the dominant magnetic influence in the area. Those particles flowing through such a gaseous magnet do not return to the south pole 
of the planet they have just passed through, but move along to the south pole of the Sun. Magnetic fields are measured by man not by the 
flow of particles, but by the direction of the flow, as the orientation is determined by which way a magnet swings under the influence of 
this flow. Thus, probes sent to measure the magnetic field of a gaseous planet find their test magnets swinging into alignment, both the 
south pole of the gaseous planet and the test magnet lined up to act as a conduit for the intense flow of magnetic particles on the move. 
The fact that there is no actual field about the gaseous planet, no return from the north pole of the gaseous magnet to its south pole, is 
not noted.

       Why is it the Sun, as the giant magnet dominating the solar system, points North and South with its poles in the directions it does? For 
those late to this argument, the Sun does not reverse polarity every 11 years as NASA states, and the solar magnetic field reaches beyond 
the outer bounds of the solar system, affecting all the planets. The Sun likewise is under the dictates of influences that surround it, and as 
the Sun goes, so go the planets.

   On October 15, 2009 NASA admitted that the prevailing concept of how the solar system was shaped was wrong. They had assumed it was delimited by the solar 
wind, creating a comet like shape - a nose cone in front and a tail in the back. Their own probe demonstrated that the solar system was in the shape of a bubble, 
delimited by magnetic particle flow.

       Images from the Ion and Neutral Camera on NASA's Cassini spacecraft suggest that the heliosphere, the region of the sun's 
influence, may not have the comet-like shape predicted by existing models. In a paper published Oct. 15 in Science Express, 
researchers from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory present a new view of the heliosphere, and the forces that shape 
it. As the solar wind flows from the sun, it carves out a bubble in the interstellar medium. Models of the boundary region between 
the heliosphere and interstellar medium have been based on the assumption that the relative flow of the interstellar medium and its 
collision with the solar wind dominate the interaction. This would create a foreshortened "nose" in the direction of the solar 
system's motion, and an elongated "tail" in the opposite direction. The Ion and Neutral Camera images suggest that the solar 
wind's interaction with the interstellar medium is instead more significantly controlled by particle pressure and magnetic field 
energy density.

       "[The ribbon is] aligned by and dominated by the external magnetic field," McComas said in a briefing Thursday. "That's a huge 
clue as to what's going on. But still we're missing some really fundamental aspect of the interaction - some fundamental physics is 
missing from our understanding." The new IBEX results will be published in the Oct. 16 issue of the journal Science.
