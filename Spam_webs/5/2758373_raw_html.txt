  <h1>
   Eating in Washington DC's Chinatown
  </h1>
  This is a short survey of restaurants in Washington DC's Chinatown, made
over the course of a year or so.  As I have only been to some of these
restaurants once or twice, I cannot attest to absolute accuracy here, but
the few restaurants that I have raved about have been tested many, many
times with many different people, and they are surely accurate.
  <p>
   When eating in Chinatown, it's best if you can read Chinese characters because
the English menus are quite limited.  To the English-speaker, it seems as if
all the menus in town are close to identical.  If you cannot do this, your
next two steps are to try some of the places listed which I have specifically
pointed out as having elaborate English menus, or to eat dim sum style where
you merely need to point out the dishes you wish.  Specials, however, are almost
always listed in Chinese only, on banners on the wall.  Bringing along someone 
who speaks Chinese may or may not be of much use; because of the difference
in dialects, there is often great confusion.  Knowing how to read Chinese,
however, is quite useful.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have generally rated places overall on a ten-point scale.
   <b>
    10 = excellent; 1 = poor.
   </b>
   With the advent of fancy mapping systems
on the web, I have removed the Chinatown map, however, and added postal
addresses.

    1 - Burma - 3
   </b>
   <br/>
   740 6th St NW Fl 2, 202-638-1280
   <br/>
   Sadly the food at the Burma is not what it used to be.  While the 
	cuisine itself has elements of both Chinese and Indian cooking, the
	quality of the actual food here has declined sadly.  It appears that
	the former chef here has left to help open the Mandalay restaurant in
	College Park, which we have tried and which is highly recommended.

    2 - Cafe-Deli Viet-Thai - ?

   Best pot krapau in Chinatown, but no Chinese food here.

   </b>
   <br/>
   629-631 H. St NW, 202-216-9696
   <br/>
   Formerly operating as Charlie Chiang's Grande Cafe.
        After 50 years, China Inn closed down and this location is now
        occupied by a new restaurant with new management.  Dim sum upstairs
	is pretty good and rates a 7, reportedly with some former staff
	from the Golden Palace in the kitchen.  Lunch buffet below is not
	edible and should be avoided at all costs, getting a 3. (Mar 2004)

   </b>
   <br/>
   627 H St NW, 202-289-4755
   <br/>
   Generally catering to the Western trade.... limited menu although
	with a good variety of seafood specialties.  Good soups, but the
	tea-smoked duck was bland and other dishes tended more toward sweet
	sauces than not.  Everything is on one menu so you need not look
	for the ``special Chinese menu.'' (Dec 2002)
  </p>

   <b>
    4 - Chinatown Express - 5
   </b>
   <br/>
   746 6th St NW, 202-638-0424 or 888-889-0038
   <br/>
   The last trip made here was much better than previous trips.  In
	the past I've had very poorly made chow foon, and poor hot pot items.
	But in the most recent trip the hot pot was quite tasty.  In general,
	avoid anything on the menu other than the stretched noodles and 
	fresh dumplings (which are made like the stretched noodles and are
	much softer than the usual dumplings).  Stay away from the lunch menu
	and go for the steamed buns (again made like the stretched noodles,
	not like dim sum pork buns).  Regular menu gets a 4, but the stretched
	noodles are very fine.  (March 2002)

    5- Full Kee - 9
   </b>
   <br/>
   509 H St NW, 202-371-2233
   <br/>
   Excellent congee, good noodle dishes.   Recomended.  Extensive
        Chinese menu is translated into English.  (Nov 2002)
  </p>
  <p>
   Full Kee has another restaurant in Richmond, VA, which is also
	quite good in spite of some interesting use of non-Chinese
	vegetables in many items, and which does dim sum.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    6- Golden Palace - 10
   </b>
   <br/>
   A huge dimsum operation.  Best dimsum in town.  Eat here.
	I cannot recommend this place highly enough.  (Dec 1998)
   <br/>
   <b>
    ---BAD NOTE--
   </b>
   <br/>
   As we go to press, the Washington Post reports that the Golden Palace
        is shutting down on Boxing day, to re-open some time later in 1999 at
        800 Eighth st.  They close only three days after President Clinton
        ate there.   This is a tragedy, and we can only wish them luck in 
        getting opened as soon as possible at their new location.
  </p>
  <p>
   It should be noted that as of January 2003, the former location of
	the Golden Palace has been occupied by a Radio Shack.  Radio Shack
	sells mostly Chinese products but of much lower quality.

    7 - Chop Sticks - 5
   </b>
   <br/>
   717 H. Street NW, 202-898-1986
   <br/>
   This place has changed considerably since my last visit in January
	of 1997, having been renovated.  The food is standard Cantonese fare
	although you must ask for the Chinese menu because it won't be given
	to you by default.  Hot and sour soup was very hot and they get many
	points for using fresh mushrooms.  On my last visit, the beef was
	somewhat low-grade and they had stopped using char siu in the egg
	rolls.    CLOSED MARCH 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   A decade ago, I went in once in the late
	afternoon and was the only guy there... the waitress shouted into the
	kitchen that there was a white guy here (and the word she used was not
	a polite one) and suddenly the bad Chinese pop music changed to bad
	American pop music.  I do not think this would happen there today,
	which is kind of sad.  (Dec 2002)

    9 - Wok and Roll - 6

   <br/>
   604 H St NW, 202-347-4656
   <br/>
   The restaurant that was open for many years at this location, Go Lo's,
	has been remodelled and reopened under new management but with the same
	kitchen staff.  They have added a sushi counter and a bubble tea stand
	in order to get with the latest trends in Asian foods that white people
	like, and the menu has been simplified with all of the flaming hibachi
	stuff removed.  Generally the usual fare, these folks are trying very
	hard to cater to the Western crowd.  They can cook pretty well when
	specifically asked but will otherwise tend to the usual sweet slop in
	an attempt to appeal to the white crowd.  (Jan 2002)

   <br/>
   505 H St NW, 202-667-3660
   <br/>
   Formerly the site of Good Taste restaurant.  Becky's has a mixture
	of Western food like subs and sandwiches, which I would point you
	toward before the Chinese food.  They do have delivery, though, but
	that doesn't really make up for the food quality.  (Jan 1998)

    11 - Jackey Cafe - 7

   611 H st NW, 202-408-1288.
   <br/>
   Mostly traditional Cantonese food, with good congee, noodle soups,
        and wonderful pan-fried noodle.
        This location was previously owned by Ho Wah and then the Rainbow
        In, both fairly low-grade places, but the new owners have done an
        excellent job of cleaning the place up.  (Jun 2007)

   624 H St NW, 202-783-5858
   <br/>
   These folks sell the usual sweet glop for the tourist trade, but
	they also have the best Hunan food in the area.  The tea-smoked
	duck is amazing.  If you order carefully, there is some very fine
	food on the menu.  You must pick carefully, though, and be aware
	that there is no Chinese menu and they cater primarily to the Western
	trade.  They will make authentic Hunan food but sometimes need some
	motivation to do so.  I have had both very fine and very poor meals
	here.   (Jan 2003)
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    13 - Hunan Gourmet - 0
   </b>
   <br/>
   I am pleased to report that Hunan Gourmet is now closed, and the
	operation has moved to Rockville, MD where they are operating as
	Canton Cafe.  As this is the place where I was served putrid food
	which in May of 1997 gave me food poisoning resulting in spasms on 
        both ends of my GI tract for three days of agony, I am happy to 
        report that others will now be spared this fate.  (January 1999)

    14 - Kam Fong Seafood Restaurant - 6 --- RELOCATED OUT OF CHINATOWN
   </b>
   <br/>
   807-809 7th St NW, 202-898-1138
   <br/>
   Avoid the lunch menu, and stick to the dinner menu.  Good bakery
	attached, good sizzling items.  Large banquet facilities, and good
	tea, even.  (May 2001)
  </p>
  <p>
   Like most places in Chinatown, Kam Fong closed in the 2000-2010
        decade, but unlike most of them, the management opened up a new
        restaurant, New Kam Fong, at 2400 University Blvd, Rockville MD.
        The food at New Kam Fong is appreciably better and they still have
        the wonderful pineapple buns that Kam Fong was known for.

   This place warrants only a 4 for items off the regular menu,
	but they have a seperate dim sum menu which is reasonable, and
	warrants a 6.  The regular menu consists mostly of lunch slop,
	with overly sweet sauces and gummy spring rolls, but the dim sum
	is okay, and available seven days a week. (Jan 1999)

   610 H St NW, 202-628-0490

   These folks are taking real trouble to attract the white trade,
	doing things like translating the special menus.  The food is
	good if not phenomenal and if you are looking for the more 
	interesting meals but can't read characters, they're a big help.
	These folks had closed down for a while in Jan 2000 but reopened
	after a short period.    They also deliver. (Feb 2004)

    18 - Eat First - 6

   609 H St NW, 202-289-1703
   <br/>
   The Ruby restaurant that served good Cantonese food in this location
	shut down in early 2001, and the Eat First restaurant that was
	previously around the corner has moved in after two years of absence.
	Although this place rates fairly low for food, with heavy egg rolls,
	and a higher than average proportion of premade sauces, they are also 
	the only place in town which not only provides an extensive English 
	translation of the special menu, but also provides a translation of 
	the specials on the walls.  Even so, many of my complaints about them
	in 1997 (like prepackaged mustard and uneven cooking) seem to be now
	remedied.  Staff speaks good English and is very helpful, and it is 
        the most clean and shining place in the area.  I mean, the place
	literally sparkles.  Good noodle dishes.  (August 2001)

    19 - Szechuan Gallery and Penang Rasa Selang- 6

   <br/>
   617 H St NW
   <br/>
   After a fire in 2001, Szechuan Gallery opened up in conjunction with
	Penang Rasa Selang, a Malaysian restaurant.  They have two sides to
	the kitchen, a Szechuan and a Malaysian one.  The Chinese food is
	reasonable and well-done although with a fairly small menu.  They do
	make a point of translating all of the dishes, though, including the
	``Taiwanese Foods'' which they do very well.  The Malaysian food is
	okay, but in this town where there is little other Malaysian food
	available, it doesn't have to be better.  The lunch combination special
	is also a bit of an odd idea; it's a buffet where you aren't allowed
	to serve yourself.  Stick to the main menu.  (Sept 2003)

   748 6th Sy NW, 202-628-1668
   <br/>
   Dumpy place that seems to specialize in slop for the white trade.
	Lots of premade lunch items on steam tables, no specials, no real
	Szechuan specialties at all.  This is the only place I have been
	in Chinatown where I have never seen anyone Chinese eating.  On
	the other hand, the entrees from the dinner menu are edible and
	amazingly cheap, and the tea is surprisingly good.  (Jan 2003)

   This is the former location of Ms. Tao's and Taste of China, both

   Upstairs the seafood restaurant is the sort of place that would
	get a three-star Michelin rating; it's not cheap but it's worth it.
	English menu is very, very extensive (but the Chinese menu is even
        bigger!) Downstairs there is a Mongolian barbeque. (Jan 1999)

   No real specials, but they can cook to order although they have no
	Chinese manu.  The menu they do have appears to be intended to cater
	to the Western crowd and have in the past (1999) had a persion stationed
	at the door to encourage passers-by to come in and eat.  This is 
	a very bad sign.  These folks _can_ cook well but have a tendency
	to serve overly-sweetened stuff intended for white folks unless you
	can convince them otherwise.  They opened in 1998 and seem to be
	still run by the same family.  Good chow foon, though, and some okay
        soups as well..  (Jan 2004)

   These folks just opened in 2000, and while the fish in the window
	look a bit lethargic and the egg rolls are a big chewy, the two
	visits that I have made here were quite excellent.  They say they 
	don't do much lunch trade, but they are family-run and have a complete
	English translation of the full menu (though not the specials).   And,
	that menu is very extensive.  Owned by the same family that owns the 
	Szechuan Gallery, a much older restaurant.  (Jan 2003)

   No relation at all to the Fortune in Falls Church, this one is

   In Rockville.  A&amp;J serves Northern Style dimsum, which is nothing
        at all like Hong Kong food.  Absolutely wonderful, though.  The 
        staff will shout it at you in incomprensible northern dialect,
        but the scallion pancakes alone are worth the trip.  Dr. Chen
        calls this ``Chinese hillbilly food.'' (Oct 2002)

   <b>
    Honorable Mention: Joe's Noodle Shop
   </b>
   <br/>
   In Rockville.  You place your order at the counter and they bring

        really amazing noodle soups. (Oct 2002)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the last ten years, Chinatown, like many of the ethnic neighborhoods,
has shrunk considerably with the exodus of people moving into the suburbs.
With the recent construction of the MCI Stadium, additional damage is being
done to the feel of the area and there are many who wonder how much longer
the area will last.  It is with this worry that I strongly recommend that
you patronize these businesses and try and support them as much as possible,
to keep a unique institution alive as long as possible.
