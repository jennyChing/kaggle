    Abstract
   </b>
  </center>
  <p>
   A mobile device has a service monitor agent to categorize wireless
     network data usage by the device, according to network used (for instance
     whether a WWAN or a WLAN is used) and also according to the device
     application associated with the network data usage. A set of service
     usage counters track network data usage per application for at least one
     of the networks. An application data usage user interface displays, to a
     user, service usage on a per-application basis based on the service usage
     counters.

   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0002] With the advent of mass market digital communications and content
     distribution, many access networks such as wireless networks, cable
     networks and DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) networks are pressed for user
     capacity, with, for example, EVDO (Evolution-Data Optimized), HSPA (High
     Speed Packet Access), LTE (Long Term Evolution), WiMax (Worldwide
     Interoperability for Microwave Access), and Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)
     wireless networks increasingly becoming user capacity constrained.
     Although wireless network capacity will increase with new higher capacity
     wireless radio access technologies, such as MIMO (Multiple-Input
     Multiple-Output), and with more frequency spectrum being deployed in the
     future, these capacity gains are likely to be less than what is required
     to meet growing digital networking demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0003] Similarly, although wire line access networks, such as cable and
     DSL, can have higher average capacity per user, wire line user service
     consumption habits are trending toward very high bandwidth applications
     that can quickly consume the available capacity and degrade overall
     network service experience. Because some components of service provider
     costs go up with increasing bandwidth, this trend will also negatively
     impact service provider profits.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0069] The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a
     process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer
     program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and/or a
     processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored
     on and/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this
     specification, these implementations, or any other form that the
     invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the
     order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope
     of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a
     processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may
     be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to
     perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is
     manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term "processor"
     refers to one or more devices, circuits, and/or processing cores
     configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0070] A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention
     is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the
     principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection
     with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any
     embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and
     the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and
     equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following
     description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the
     invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the
     invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of
     these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material
     that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not
     been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily
     obscured.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0071] With the development and increasing proliferation of mass market
     digital communications and content distribution, communication network
     capacity gains are being outpaced by growing digital networking demand.
     For example, some industry experts project average wireless device usage
     of four devices per subscriber, with a mixture of general purpose devices
     like smart phones and computers along with special purpose devices like
     music players, electronic readers, connected (e.g., networked) cameras
     and connected gaming devices. In addition, wire line user service
     consumption habits are trending toward very high bandwidth applications
     that can quickly consume the available capacity and degrade overall
     network service experience if not efficiently managed. Because some
     components of service provider costs go up with increasing bandwidth,
     this trend will also negatively impact service provider profits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0072] There is a need for a communication system and method that provides
     for flexible service plans and management of user network services to
     provide consumer choice of more refined service plan offerings and
     efficient management of network capacity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0073] Also, it is becoming increasingly important to more deeply manage
     the level of services delivered to networked devices to provide cost
     effective services that match growing digital networking usage patterns.
     For example, access providers can move away from only billing for basic
     access and move toward billing for higher level service delivery with
     example services including rich Internet access and email, application
     based billing, content distribution, entertainment activities,
     information or content subscription or gaming. In addition, a growing
     number of new special purpose and general purpose networked devices are
     fueling demand for new service plans, for example, tailored to the new
     device usage models (e.g., a special service plan for an e-book reader
     device).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0074] As network capabilities grow and new networked device offerings
     grow, access network service providers will realize increasing value in
     opening up their networks to allow innovation and expanded offerings for
     network service consumers. However, opening up the networks to provide
     efficient third party definition of alternative service and billing
     models requires more flexible service and billing policy management
     solutions. For example, machine to machine applications such as
     telemetry, surveillance, shipment tracking and two way power control
     systems are example new applications that would require new offerings to
     make such available to network service customers. The need to customize
     service offerings for these new applications requires more efficient
     methods for defining, testing and launching new services with more
     refined control of service functions and service costs. In some
     embodiments, this means billing for different types of service elements,
     such as total traffic, content downloads, application usage, information
     or content subscription services, people or asset tracking services, real
     time machine to machine information or electronic commerce transactions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0075] In some embodiments, network user capacity is increased and user
     service costs are reduced by managing and billing for service consumption
     in a more refined manner (e.g., to satisfy network neutrality
     requirements). By managing service consumption in a user friendly manner,
     the overall service capacity required to satisfy the user device needs
     can be tailored more closely to the needs of a given user thereby
     reducing user service costs and increasing service provider profits. For
     example, managing service usage while maintaining user satisfaction
     includes service usage policy implementation and policy management to
     identify, manage and bill for service usage categories, such as total
     traffic consumption, content downloads, application usage, information or
     content subscription services, electronic commerce transactions, people
     or asset tracking services or machine to machine networking services. As
     described herein, service activity is used to refer to any service usage
     or traffic usage that can be associated with, for example, an
     application; a network communication end point, such as an address,
     uniform resource locator (URL) or other identifier with which the device
     is communicating; a traffic content type; a transaction where content or
     other material, information or goods are transacted, purchased, reserved,
     ordered or exchanged; a download, upload or file transfer; email, text,
     SMS, IMS or other messaging activity or usage; VOIP services; video
     services; a device usage event that generates a billing event; service
     usage associated with a bill by account activity (also referred to as
     billing by account) as described herein; device location; device service
     usage patterns, device user interface (UI) discovery patterns, content
     usage patterns or other characterizations of device usage; or other
     categories of user or device activity that can be identified, monitored,
     recorded, reported, controlled or processed in accordance with a set of
     verifiable service control policies. As will be apparent to one of
     ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments described herein,
     some embodiments identify various service activities for the purpose of
     decomposing overall service usage into finer sub-categories of activities
     that can be verifiably monitored, categorized, cataloged, reported,
     controlled, monetized and used for end user notification in a manner that
     results in superior optimization of the service capabilities for various
     levels of service cost or for various types of devices or groups. In some
     embodiments, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that
     the terms service activity or service usage are associated with
     categorizing and possibly monitoring or controlling data traffic,
     application usage, communication with certain network end points, or
     transactions, and it will also be apparent that in some embodiments the
     term service activity is intended to include one or more of the broader
     aspects listed above. The shortened term service usage can be used
     interchangeably with service activity, but neither term is intended in
     general to exclude any aspect of the other. In some cases, where the
     terms service usage or service activity are used, more specific
     descriptors such as traffic usage, application usage, website usage, and
     other service usage examples are also used to provide more specific
     examples or focus in on a particular element of the more encompassing
     terms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0076] In some embodiments, employing this level of service categorization
     and control is accomplished in a manner that satisfies user preferences.
     In some embodiments, employing this level of service categorization and
     control is accomplished in a manner that also satisfies government rules
     or regulations regarding open access, for example, network neutrality
     requirements. In some embodiments, service management solutions that also
     collect and/or report user or device service usage or service activity
     behavior to determine how best to meet the user's simultaneous desires
     for service quality and lower service costs are disclosed. For example,
     such monitoring and reporting are accomplished in a manner that includes
     approval by the user and in a manner that also protects the privacy of
     user information and service usage behavior or service activity history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0077] In some embodiments, a system and method is disclosed for
     increasing network user capacity for wireless networks in the face of
     increasing service demand per user by providing for a greater number of
     base stations, also sometimes referred to as access points, base
     terminals, terminal nodes or other well known acronyms, to be more easily
     and/or more cost effectively deployed. For example, to simplify the
     process of deploying base stations, the installation complexity and the
     network infrastructure required for the base station to obtain backhaul
     service to the various networks that users desire to connect with are
     reduced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0078] In some embodiments, dense base station deployments are simplified
     by reducing the requirement to aggregate or concentrate the base station
     traffic through a specific dedicated core network infrastructure, so that
     the base stations connect to the desired user networks through a more
     diverse set of local loop, back bone and core routing options. This
     approach also reduces network infrastructure equipment, installation and
     maintenance costs. In some embodiments, this is accomplished by
     distributing the network traffic policy implementation and control away
     from the core network by providing for more control for service policy
     implementation and management on the end user device and, in some
     embodiments, in the end user device with respect to certain service
     policies and the network (e.g., control plane servers) with respect to
     other service policies. For example, this approach facilitates connecting
     the base stations directly to the local loop Internet with a minimum of
     specific dedicated networking infrastructure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0079] In some embodiments, service and transaction billing event capture
     and logging are distributed to the device. For example, providing service
     and transaction billing event capture and logging at the device provides
     a greater capability to monitor, classify and control deeper aspects of
     service usage or service activity at the device as compared to the
     relatively less capability for the same in the network infrastructure
     (e.g., for certain traffic flows, such as encrypted traffic flows).
     Furthermore, billing at the device provides for very specialized with
     many different billing and service plans for different device and service
     usage or service activity scenario combinations without the problem of
     attempting to propagate and manage many different deep packet inspection
     (DPI) and traffic shaping profiles in the networking equipment
     infrastructure. For example, service billing at the device can provide
     for more sophisticated, more specialized and more scalable billing and
     service plans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0080] Another form of billing that needs improvement is electronic
     commerce transaction billing with device assisted central billing. Today,
     most central billing and content distribution models require either
     centralized content distribution maintained by the central service
     provider or central billing authority, or a centralized ecommerce website
     or portal traffic aggregation system controlled by the central service
     provider or central billing provider, or both. In such systems, content
     and transaction providers such as media providers, application
     developers, entertainment providers, transaction website providers and
     others must adapt their mainstream electronic offering and commerce
     systems, such as shopping experience websites, to fit within the various
     proprietary customized infrastructure and content storage solutions for
     ecommerce markets, such as BREW.RTM. (Binary Runtime Environment for
     Wireless from Qualcomm.RTM. Inc.), Symbian OS (from Symbian Software Ltd)
     and Apple iPhone 3G App Store (from Apple Inc.). This approach requires a
     large amount of unnecessary custom interface development and stifles open
     market creativity for HTTP, WAP or portal/widget based shopping
     destinations and experiences. As disclosed below, a superior approach
     includes device based transaction billing for an open ecosystem in which
     a central billing provider provides users and ecommerce transaction
     providers with a central billing solution and experience that does not
     require extensive custom development or ecommerce infrastructure
     interfacing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0081] In some embodiments, products that incorporate device assisted
     service policy implementation, network services and service profiles
     (e.g., a service profile includes a set of one or more service policy
     settings for the device for a service on the network) are disclosed, as
     described below. For example, aspects of the service policy (e.g., a set
     of policies/policy settings for the device for network services,
     typically referring to lower level settings, such as access control
     settings, traffic control settings, billing system settings, user
     notification settings, user privacy settings, user preference settings,
     authentication settings and admission control settings) that are moved
     out of the core network and into the end user device include, for
     example, certain lower level service policy implementations, service
     usage or service activity monitoring and reporting including, for
     example, privacy filtering, customer resource management monitoring and
     reporting including, for example, privacy filtering, adaptive service
     policy control, service network access control services, service network
     authentication services, service network admission control services,
     service billing, transaction billing, simplified service activation and
     sign up, user service usage or service activity notification and service
     preference feedback and other service capabilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0082] As discussed below, product designs that move certain aspects of
     one or more of these service profile or service policy implementation
     elements into the device provide several advantageous solutions to the
     needs described above. For example, benefits of certain embodiments
     include the ability to manage or bill for a richer and more varied set of
     network services, better manage overall network capacity, better manage
     end user access costs, simplify user or new device service activation,
     simplify development and deployment of new devices with new service plans
     (e.g., service profile and billing/costs information associated with that
     service profile), equip central service providers with more effective
     open access networks for new third party solutions, simplify the
     equipment and processes necessary to deploy wireless base stations and
     simplify the core networking equipment required to deploy certain access
     networks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0083] As discussed below, there are two network types that are discussed:
     a central provider network and a service provider network. The central
     provider network generally refers to the access network required to
     connect the device to other networks. The central provider network
     generally includes the physical layer, the Media Access Control (MAC) and
     the various networking functions that can be implemented to perform
     authentication, authorization and access control, and to route traffic to
     a network that connects to the control plane servers, as discussed below.
     The service provider network generally refers to the network that
     includes the control plane servers. In some embodiments, a central
     provider network and a service provider network are the same, and in some
     embodiments, they are different. In some embodiments, the owner or
     manager of the central provider network and the owner or manager of the
     service provider network are the same, and in some embodiments, they are
     different.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0084] In some embodiments, control of the device service policies is
     accomplished with a set of service control plane servers that reside in
     the access network or any network that can be reached by the device. This
     server based control plane architecture provides for a highly efficient
     means of enabling third party control of services and billing, such as
     for central carrier open development programs or Mobile Virtual Network
     Operator (MVNO) relationships. As device processing and memory capacity
     expands, moving to this distributed service policy processing
     architecture also becomes more efficient and economical. In some
     embodiments, several aspects of user privacy and desired network
     neutrality are provided by enabling user control of certain aspects of
     device based service usage or service activity reporting, traffic
     reporting, service policy control and customer resource management (CRM)
     reporting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0085] In many access networks, such as wireless access networks,
     bandwidth capacity is a valuable resource in the face of the increasing
     popularity of devices, applications and content types that consume more
     bandwidth. To maintain reasonable service profit margins, a typical
     present service provider practice is to charge enough per user for access
     to make service plans profitable for the higher bandwidth users. However,
     this is not an optimal situation for users who desire to pay less for
     lower bandwidth service usage or service activity scenarios.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0086] Accordingly, in some embodiments, a range of service plan pricing
     can be enabled that also maintains service profitability for the service
     provider, for example, by providing a more refined set of management and
     control capabilities for service profiles. For example, this approach
     generally leads to service management or traffic shaping where certain
     aspects of a service are controlled down based on service policies to
     lower levels of quality of service. Generally, there are three problems
     that arise when these techniques are implemented. The first problem is
     maintaining user privacy preferences in the reporting of service usage or
     service activity required to set, manage or verify service policy
     implementation. This problem is solved in a variety of ways by the
     embodiments described below with a combination of user notification,
     preference feedback and approval for the level of traffic information the
     user is comfortable or approves and the ability to filter service usage
     or service activity, in some embodiments, specifically traffic usage or
     CRM reports so that only the level of information the user prefers to
     share is communicated. The second problem is satisfying network
     neutrality requirements in the way that traffic is shaped or services are
     managed. This problem is solved in a variety of ways as described in the
     embodiments described below by empowering the user to make the choices on
     how service usage, service activity, traffic usage or CRM data is managed
     down to control costs, including embodiments on user notification and
     service policy preference feedback. By allowing the user to decide how
     they want to spend and manage their service allowance or resources, a
     more neutral or completely neutral approach to network usage can be
     maintained by the service provider. The third problem is to help the user
     have an acceptable and enjoyable service experience for the lower cost
     plans that will result in much wider scale adoption of connected devices
     and applications but are more constrained on service activity usage or
     options or bandwidth or traffic usage. As lower cost service plans are
     offered, including plans where the basic connection service may be free,
     these service plans will require service provider cost controls to
     maintain profitability or preserve network capacity that result in lower
     limits on service usage or service activity. These lower service usage or
     service activity limit plans will result in more users who are likely run
     over service usage limits and either experience service shutdown or
     service cost overages unless they are provided with more capable means
     for assistance on how to use and control usage for the lower cost
     services. This problem is solved in a variety of ways with a rich
     collection of embodiments on user notification, service usage and cost
     projection, user notification policy feedback, user service policy
     preference feedback, and adaptive traffic shaping or service policy
     implementation. As described herein, some embodiments allow a wide range
     of flexible and verifiable service plan and service profile
     implementations ranging from examples such as free ambient services that
     are perhaps sponsored by transaction revenues and/or bill by account
     sponsored service partner revenues, to intermediately priced plans for
     basic access services for mass market user devices or machine to machine
     communication devices, to more expensive plans with very high levels of
     service usage or service activity limits or no limits at all. Several
     bill by account embodiments also provide for the cataloging of service
     usage that is not a direct benefit to end users but is needed for basic
     maintenance of the device control channels and access network connection,
     so that the maintenance traffic service cost can be removed from the user
     billing or billed to non-user accounts used to track or account for such
     service costs. These embodiments and others result in a service usage or
     service activity control capability that provides more attractive device
     and service alternatives to end users while maintaining profitability for
     service providers and their partners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0087] In some embodiments, the above described various embodiments for
     device based service policy and/or service profile communications control
     are implemented using network based service control, for example, for
     satisfying various network neutrality and/or privacy requirements, based
     on indication(s) received from the device (e.g., user input provided
     using the device UI using the service processor) and network based
     service control (e.g., using a DPI service monitor or DPC policy
     implementation and/or other network elements).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0088] In some embodiments, a virtual network overlay includes a device
     service processor, a network service controller and a control plane
     communication link to manage various aspects of device based network
     service policy implementation. In some embodiments, the virtual network
     overlay networking solution is applied to an existing hierarchical
     network (e.g., for wireless services), and in some embodiments, is
     applied to simplify or flatten the network architecture as will be
     further described below. In some embodiments, the large majority of the
     complex data path network processing required to implement the richer
     service management objectives of existing hierarchical networks (e.g.,
     for wireless services) are moved into the device, leaving less data path
     processing required in the edge network and in some cases even less in
     the core network. Because the control plane traffic between the service
     control servers and the device agents that implement service policies can
     be several orders of magnitude slower than the data plane traffic,
     service control server network placement and back-haul infrastructure is
     much less performance sensitive than the data plane network. In some
     embodiments, as described further below, this architecture can be
     overlaid onto all the important existing access network architectures
     used today. In some embodiments, this architecture can be employed to
     greatly simplify core access network routing and data plane traffic
     forwarding and management. For example, in the case of wireless networks,
     the incorporation of device assisted service policy implementation
     architectures can result in base stations that directly connect to the
     Internet local loop and the data traffic does not need to be concentrated
     into a dedicated core network. This results, for example, in a large
     reduction in backhaul cost, core network cost and maintenance cost. These
     cost savings can be re-deployed to purchase and install more base
     stations with smaller cells, which results in higher data capacity for
     the access network leading to better user experience, more useful
     applications and lower service costs. This flattened networking
     architecture also results in latency reduction as fewer routes are needed
     to move traffic through the Internet. In some embodiments, the present
     invention provides the necessary teaching to enable this powerful
     transformation of centralized network service architectures to a more
     distributed device based service architectures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0089] Device based billing can be compromised, hacked and/or spoofed in
     many different ways. Merely determining that billing reports are being
     received from the device, that the device agent software is present and
     properly configured (e.g., the billing agent is present and properly
     configured) is insufficient and easily spoofed (e.g., by spoofing the
     agent itself, providing spoofed billing reports using a spoofed billing
     agent or providing spoofed agent configurations). Accordingly, in some
     embodiments, verifiable device assisted and/or network based service
     policy implementation is provided. For example, verifiable service usage
     and/or service usage billing can be provided as described herein with
     respect to various embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0090] While much of the below discussion and embodiments described below
     focus on paid service networks, those of ordinary skill in the art will
     appreciate that many of the embodiments also apply to other networks,
     such as enterprise networks. For example, the same device assisted
     network services that create access control services, ambient activation
     services and other service profiles can be used by corporate IT managers
     to create a controlled cost service policy network for corporate mobile
     devices. As another example, embodiments described below for providing
     end user service control can also allow a service provider to offer
     parental controls by providing parents with access to a website with a
     web page that controls the policy settings for the access control
     networking service for a child's device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Network Architecture for Device Assisted/Based Service Control
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0091] FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified (e.g., "flattened") network
     architecture in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, this provides
     for a simplified service infrastructure that exemplifies a simplified and
     "flattened" network architecture in accordance with some embodiments that
     is advantageous for wireless network architectures. This also reduces the
     need for complex data path protocol interaction between the base station
     and network infrastructure. For example, in contrast to a complex edge
     and core network infrastructure connecting base stations to the central
     service provider network, as shown the base stations 125 are connected
     directly to the Internet 120 via firewalls 124 (in some embodiments, the
     base stations 125 include the firewall functionality 124). Accordingly,
     in some embodiments, a central provider network is no longer required to
     route, forward, inspect or manipulate data plane traffic, because data
     plane traffic policy implementation is conducted in the device 100 by the
     service processor 115. However, it is still an option, in some
     embodiments, to bring data plane traffic in from the base stations 125 to
     a central provider network using either open or secure Internet routing
     if desired. Base station control plane communication for access network
     AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server 121, DNS/DHCP
     (Domain Name System/Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server 126,
     mobile wireless center 132 (sometimes referenced to in part as a home
     location register (HLR) or other acronym) or other necessary functions
     are accomplished, for example, with a secure IP tunnel or TCP connection
     between the central provider network and the base stations. The base
     station 125 is used to refer to multiple base station embodiments where
     the base station itself is directly connected to the RAN, or where the
     base station connects to a base station controller or base station
     aggregator function that in turn connects to the RAN, and all such
     configurations are collectively referred to herein as base station 125 in
     FIG. 1 and most figures that follow that reference base station 125 as
     described below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0092] As shown, the central provider access network is both 3G and 4G
     capable, the devices 100 can be either 3G, 4G or multi-mode 3G and 4G.
     Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that in the more
     general case, the network could be 2G, 3G and 4G capable, or the device
     could be 2G, 3G and 4G capable with all or a subset of Global System for
     Mobile (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Code Division Multiple
     Access (CDMA) 1X, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Evolution Data
     Optimized (EVDO), Long Term Evolution (LTE) and WiMax modem capability.
     If the devices are single mode, then the 3G devices 100 will be activated
     with a service profile applied to service processor 115 that is
     consistent with the 3G network capacity and speed, and the 4G devices
     will be activated with service profiles applied to service processor 115
     that are consistent with 4G network capacity and speed. In both cases,
     the same service controller 122 manages services for both sets of devices
     in accordance with some embodiments. If the devices are multimode, then
     the service processor 115 can be activated with a dual mode service
     profile capability in which the service profile for 3G offers a similar
     rich set of services as the service profile for 4G but with, for example,
     scaled back bandwidth. For example, this approach is allows central
     providers to offer a richer set of service offerings with 3G and then
     migrate the same set of service offerings to 4G but with higher
     performance. In particular, this approach allows 3G to 4G rich service
     migration to occur, for example, with the only change being the increased
     bandwidth settings in the service profiles that will be available in 4G
     at the same cost as 3G with lower service profile bandwidth settings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0093] In some embodiments, if the devices are multimode, a network
     selection policy implementation within service processor 115 is provided,
     or in some embodiments, a network selection policy is driven by policy
     decisions made in service controller 122 based on service availability
     reports received from service processor 115. The network selection policy
     allows the selection of the network that corresponds to the most
     desirable service profile to meet the user's service preferences. For
     example, if the user specifies, within the framework of the service
     notification and user preference feedback embodiments described below,
     that maximum performance is the most important factor in selecting which
     access network to connect to, then the best profile is likely to be the
     4G network as 4G is typically faster, except perhaps, for example, if the
     device 100 is closer to the 3G base station so that there is a much
     stronger signal or if the 4G network is much more heavily loaded than the
     3G network. On the other hand, if the user preference set specifies cost
     as the most important factor, then depending on the central provider
     service costs the 3G network may prove to be the most desirable service
     profile. This is a simple example and many other selection criteria are
     possible in the network selection embodiment as discussed further below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Network Based Service Usage Monitoring for Verification and Other Purposes
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0094] In some embodiments, if the base station data plane traffic is
     transmitted via the Internet 120 as discussed above, then IPDRs (Internet
     Protocol Detail Records, also sometimes and interchangeably referred to
     herein as Charging Data Records or CDRs, which as used herein refer to
     any network measure of service usage or service activity for voice and/or
     data traffic (e.g., IPDRs can include a time stamp, a device ID, and
     various levels of network measures of service usage for the device
     associated with that device ID, such as perhaps total traffic usage,
     network destination, time of day or device location)) are generated by
     and collected from the access network equipment. Depending on the
     specific network configuration, as discussed herein, for a WWAN network
     the IPDRs can be generated by one or more of the following: base station
     125, RAN or transport gateways and AAA 121. In some access network
     embodiments, the IPDRs are transmitted to equipment functions that
     aggregated the IPDRs for the purpose of service billing and other
     functions. Aggregation can occur in the AAA, the transport gateways or
     other functions including the billing system 123. As discussed below, it
     is often the case that the IPDRs is assumed to be obtained from the AAA
     server 121 and/or a service usage data store 118 (e.g., a real-time
     service usage collection stored in a database or a delayed feed service
     usage collection stored in a database), or some other network function.
     However, this does not imply that the IPDRs may not be obtained from a
     variety of other network functions, and in some embodiments, the IPDRs
     are obtained from other network functions as disclosed herein. In some
     embodiments, existing IPDR sources are utilized to obtain network based
     service usage measures for multiple purposes including but not limited to
     service policy or profile implementation verification, triggering service
     verification error responds actions, and service notification
     synchronization. Certain types of IPDRs can be based on, or based in part
     on, what are sometimes referred to as CDRs (Charging Data Records, which
     can track charges for voice and data usage) or modifications of CDRs.
     Although the capability to monitor, categorize, catalog, report and
     control service usage or service activity is in general higher on the
     device than it is in the network, and, as described herein, device based
     service monitoring or control assistance is in some ways desirable as
     compared to network based implementations, as described herein many
     embodiments take advantage of network based service monitoring or control
     to augment device assisted service monitoring or control and vice versa.
     For example, even though many embodiments work very well with minimal
     IPDR service usage or service activity information that is already
     available in a network, deeper levels of IPDR packet inspection
     information in general enable deeper levels of service monitoring or
     service control verification, which can be desirable in some embodiments.
     As another example, deeper levels of network capability to control
     service usage or service activity can provide for more sophisticated
     error handling in some embodiments, for example, providing for more
     options of the Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) and network quarantine
     embodiments as described herein. As another example, in some embodiments
     it is advantageous to take advantage of network based service monitoring
     or control for those service aspects the network is capable of
     supporting, while using device assisted service monitoring or control for
     the service aspects advantageously implemented on the device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0095] In some embodiments, where base station data plane traffic is
     backhauled and concentrated in a central provider core network 110, then
     the IPDRs can originate in the base stations or a router or gateway in
     the central provider network 110, and the IPDRs are collected at the AAA
     server 121 and stored in the service usage data store 118. In some
     embodiments, the central billing system 123 collects the IPDRs from the
     AAA server 121 for service billing accounting purposes. In some
     embodiments, a central billing system 123 collects the IPDRs directly
     from the initial IPDR source or some other aggregator. In some
     embodiments, outside partners like MVNOs gain access to the IPDRs from
     the central billing system 123. As discussed below, it is assumed that
     the IPDRs are obtained from the AAA server 121, and it is understood that
     the source of the IPDRs is interchangeable in the embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0096] In some embodiments, the IPDR information is used by the service
     processor 115, the service controller 122 and/or other network apparatus
     or device apparatus to implement service control verification is provided
     as described below. In some embodiments, an IPDR feed (e.g., also
     referred to as a charging data record (CDR)) flows between network
     elements. For example, an IPDR feed can flow from the RAN gateway 410
     (e.g., SGSN 410, BSC packet control 510 or RNC 512) and the transport
     gateway 420 (e.g., GGSN or PDSN). In other embodiments, the IPDRs
     originate and flow from the base station 125 or some other
     component/element in the network. In some embodiments, one or more of
     these IPDR feeds is transmitted to an IPDR aggregation function (e.g.,
     also referred to as a charging gateway). For example, this aggregation
     function can be located in the AAA 121, in the mobile wireless center 132
     (and/or in the home location register (HLR) or other similar function
     referred to by other common industry names), in the transport gateway
     420, or in some other network element. This aggregation function collects
     the IPDR feeds into a database with an entry for each device 100. In some
     embodiments, an intermediate aggregation function is provided that feeds
     a higher level aggregation function, for example, the transport gateway
     420 can receive IPDR feeds from the RAN gateway 410 or the base station
     125 before sending them to another aggregation function. At some point in
     time (e.g., at the end of a specified time period, at the end of a device
     network connection session and/or at a specified time of day), the IPDR
     aggregation function sends summary information or detailed information of
     the IPDRs for a given device or group of devices to the billing system
     for billing and/or reconciliation. In some embodiments, in which the IPDR
     aggregation feed to the billing system is frequent enough for one or more
     of the IPDR information purposes described herein, the IPDR feed for the
     service controller 122 is derived from the aggregated feed, either by
     having the billing system 123 transmit it to the service controller 122,
     or by copying it from the IPDR aggregation function.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0097] In some embodiments, the IPDR feed is obtained from the network
     function that is generating or aggregating the IPDR feed as described
     herein. In some embodiments, the IPDR feed is copied from the aggregation
     function in a manner that does not interrupt the operation of the
     network. For example, a switch based port analysis function can be used
     to copy the traffic to a traffic analysis or server element that filters
     out the IPDR traffic and records it to a data base that is then either
     pushed to the service controller 122 (or any other network element that
     uses IPDR information as described herein), or is queried by the service
     controller 122 (or any other function that uses the IPDR information as
     described herein). In some embodiments, if the aggregated IPDR
     information transmitted to the billing system is delayed from real-time
     traffic usage events by an amount of time that is, for example, too long
     for desired operation, or for any other reason that makes it less
     desirable to obtain the IPDR information from the same aggregated feed
     used for the billing system 123, the IPDR information can be collected
     from one or more of the sources discussed above including, for example,
     from another aggregation point (e.g., the feed to the charging gateway,
     AAA server and/or mobile wireless center/HLR), one or more of the
     gateways 410, 420, 508, 512, 520, 608, 612, 620, 708, 712, 720 the base
     station 125 and/or another network element. In some embodiments, the IPDR
     feeds from these or other network functions are copied to a database as
     described above, which is either pushed or queried to get the information
     to the service controller 122 or other network elements that request the
     IPDR information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0098] In some embodiments, the service processor 115 includes various
     components, such as device agents, that perform service policy
     implementation or management functions. In some embodiments, these
     functions include service policy or implementation verification, service
     policy implementation tamper prevention, service allowance or denial,
     application access control, traffic control, network access control
     services, various network authentication services, service control plane
     communication, device heartbeat services, service billing, transaction
     billing, simplified activation services and/or other service
     implementations or service policy implementations. It will be apparent to
     those of ordinary skill in the art that the division in functionality
     between one device agent and another is a design choice, that the
     functional lines can be re-drawn in any technically feasible way that the
     product designers see fit, and that the placing divisions on the naming
     and functional breakouts for device agents aids in understanding,
     although in more complex embodiments, for example, it can make sense to
     the product designer to break out device agent functionality
     specifications in some other manner in order to manage development
     specification and testing complexity and workflow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0099] In some embodiments, network control of the service policy settings
     and services as discussed above is accomplished with the service
     controller 122 which in various embodiments includes one or more server
     functions. As with the service processor 115 agent naming and functional
     break out, it is understood that service controller 122 server naming and
     functional breakout is also a design choice and is provided mainly to aid
     in the discussion. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the
     art that the server names and functional breakouts do not imply that each
     name is an individual server, and, for example, a single named function
     in the various embodiments can be implemented on multiple servers, or
     multiple named functions in the various embodiments can be implemented on
     a single server.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0100] As shown, there are multiple open content transaction partner sites
     134 (e.g., open content transaction servers), which represent the
     websites or experience portals offered by content partners or ecommerce
     transaction partners of the service provider. For example, transaction
     servers 134 can provide an electronic commerce offering and transaction
     platform to the device. In some embodiments, the central provider has
     ownership and management of the service controller 122, so the central
     provider and the service provider are the same, but as discussed below
     the service provider that uses the service controller 122 to manage the
     device services by way of service processor 115 is not always the same as
     the central provider who provides the access network services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0101] In some embodiments, further distribution of central provider
     access networking functions such as access network AAA server 121,
     DNS/DHCP server 126, and other functions are provided in the base
     stations 125. In some embodiments, network based device service
     suspend/resume control are also provided in the base stations 125 (or in
     some embodiments, for hierarchical or overlay networks, this function is
     provided by one or more of the following: RAN gateways, transport
     gateways, AAA 121 or some other network function). As shown, the
     following are connected (e.g., in network communication with) the central
     provider network 110: central provider billing system 123, dedicated
     leased lines 128 (e.g., for other services/providers), central provider
     service controller 122, a content management (e.g., content switching,
     content billing, and content catching) system 130, central provider
     DNS/DHCP server 126, access network AAA server 121, service usage data
     store 118 and central provider mobile wireless center 132. These
     embodiments may be advantageous particularly for flat networks as that
     shown in FIG. 1 that are provided by the present invention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0102] In some embodiments, the base stations 125 implement a firewall
     function via firewall 124 and are placed directly onto the local loop
     Internet for backhaul. Voice traffic transport is provided with a secure
     protocol with Voice Over IP (VOIP) framing running over a secure IP
     session, for example, Virtual Private Network (VPN), IP Security (IPSEC)
     or another secure tunneling protocol. In some embodiments, the VOIP
     channel employs another layer of application level security on the
     aggregated VOIP traffic trunk before it is placed on the secure IP
     transport layer. Base station control traffic and other central provider
     traffic can be provided in a number of ways with secure transport
     protocols running over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet
     Protocol (IP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP), although TCP provides a
     more reliable delivery channel for control traffic that is not as
     sensitive to delay or jitter. One example embodiment for the control
     channel is a control link buffering, framing, encryption and secure
     transport protocol similar to that described below for the service
     control link between a device and the network. In some embodiments, a
     service control heartbeat function is provided to the base stations 125
     similar to that implemented between the service controller 122 and the
     service processor 115 as described below. If the need to maintain a
     bandwidth efficient control plane channel between the base stations and
     the central provider base station control network is not as critical as
     it is in the case of access network connection to the device, then there
     are many other approaches for implementing a secure control channel over
     the Internet including, for example, one or more of various packet
     encryption protocols running at or just below the application layer,
     running TCP Transport Layer Security (TLS), and running IP level security
     or secure tunnels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0103] In some embodiments, the device based services control plane
     traffic channel between the service processor 115 and the service
     controller 122 is implemented over the same control plane channel used
     for the flat base station control architecture, or in some embodiments,
     over the Internet. As discussed below, it is assumed that the device
     bases services control plane channel for service processor 115 to service
     controller 122 communications is established through the Internet 120 or
     through the access network using IP protocols as this is the more general
     case and applies to overlay network applications for various embodiments
     as well as applications where various embodiments are used to enable
     flattened access networks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0104] In some embodiments, by enabling the device to verifiably implement
     a rich set of service features as described herein, and by enabling the
     base station 125 to connect directly to the Internet 120 with a local
     firewall for device data traffic, tunnel the voice to a voice network
     with VOIP and secure Internet protocols, and control the base station 125
     over a secure control plane channel using base station control servers
     located in a central provider network, base stations 125 can be more
     efficiently provisioned and installed, because, for example, the base
     station 125 can accommodate a greater variety of local loop backhaul
     options. In such embodiments, it is advantageous to perform certain basic
     network functions in the base station 125 rather than the central
     provider network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0105] In some embodiments, a basic device suspend/resume function for
     allowing or disallowing the device Internet access is provided by the
     base stations 125 (or in some embodiments, for hierarchical or overlay
     networks in some embodiments this function is provided by one or more of
     the following: RAN gateways, transport gateways, AAA 121 or some other
     network function). This functionality, as will be discussed below, is
     important for certain embodiments involving taking action to resolve, for
     example, service policy verification errors. In some embodiments, this
     function is performed at the base station (e.g., base stations 125)
     thereby eliminating the need for a more complex networking equipment
     hierarchy and traffic concentration required to perform the
     suspend/resume function deeper in the network. Access network base
     stations control media access and are therefore designed with awareness
     of which device identification number a given traffic packet, group of
     packets, packet flow, voice connection or other traffic flow originates
     from and terminates to. In some embodiments, the suspend/resume function
     is implemented in the base station 125 by placing an access control
     function in the traffic path of each device traffic flow. The suspend
     resume function can be used by various network elements, and in the
     context of the present embodiment can be used by the service controller
     122 (e.g., in some embodiments, access control integrity server 1654
     (FIG. 16) of service controller 122 or other service controller elements)
     to suspend and resume device service based on the assessment of the
     service policy implementation verification status as described below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0106] In some embodiments, at least a basic traffic monitoring or service
     monitoring function is performed at the base station (e.g., base stations
     125) similar to the service history records or IPDRs collected deeper in
     the network in more conventional hierarchical access network
     infrastructure architectures. For example, the service or traffic
     monitoring history records are advantageous for tracking device network
     service usage or service activity behavior and for certain verification
     methods for device based service policy implementation or higher device
     based services as discussed below. In some embodiments, a traffic
     monitoring function is provided in the base station 125 in which the
     traffic for each device is at least counted for total traffic usage and
     recorded. In some embodiments, traffic inspection beyond simply counting
     total traffic usage is provided. For example, the base station traffic
     monitor can record and report IP addresses or include a DNS lookup
     function to report IP addresses or IP addresses and associated Uniform
     Resource Locators (URLs). Another example allows the base station 125 to
     attach location data to the IPDR to provide device location data in the
     records. In some embodiments, traffic inspection includes recording
     deeper levels of traffic or service monitoring.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0107] In some embodiments, device traffic associated with service
     verification conditions indicating service usage is out of policy or
     profile limits or allowances is routed to a quarantine network rather
     than or as an initial alternative to a suspending service. For example,
     the advantages for this approach and a more detailed description of the
     quarantine network are discussed below. In some embodiments, the
     quarantine network capability is provided for in which rather than simply
     suspending device traffic completely from the network as described above,
     the base station 125 includes a firewall function (e.g., firewall 124)
     that is capable of passing device access traffic with the quarantine
     network destinations and blocking device access to all other
     destinations. In some embodiments, when it is discovered that service
     verification conditions indicate that service usage is out of policy or
     profile limits or allowances, then one or more of the following actions
     are taken: the user is notified of the overage condition, the user is
     required to acknowledge the overage condition, the user account is billed
     for the overage condition, and the device is flagged for further analysis
     by a network device analysis function or a network manager.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0108] In some embodiments, network complexity is reduced using the device
     without moving completely to a flat base station network as described
     above. Device participation in the core network services implementation
     provides for numerous measures for simplifying or improving network
     architecture, functionality or performance. For example, two approaches
     are discussed below ranging from a simple overlay of the service
     processor 115 onto devices and the service controller 122 in a
     conventional hierarchical access network as illustrated in FIGS. 4
     through 7, to a completely flat network as illustrated in FIGS. 1 through
     3 and 8. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the
     disclosed embodiments provided herein can be combined with the above
     embodiments and other embodiments involving flat network base stations to
     provide several advantages including, for example, richer service
     capability, less access network complexity, lower access network
     expenses, more flexible base station deployments, or less complex or less
     expensive base station back haul provisioning and service costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0109] In most of the discussion that follows, the network based service
     history records and the network based suspend-resume functionality used
     in certain embodiments involving service implementation verification are
     assumed to be derived from the device service history 1618 (as shown in
     FIG. 16) central provider network element and the AAA server 121 central
     provider network element, and in some embodiments, working in conjunction
     with other central provider network elements. It is understood that these
     functions provided by the network can be rearranged to be provided by
     other networking equipment, including the base station as discussed
     above. It is also understood that the network based device traffic
     monitoring, recording and reporting to the device service history 1618
     element can be accomplished at the base stations. Furthermore, it is
     understood that while the AAA server 121 is assumed to provide the
     suspend/resume functionality, quarantine network routing or limited
     network access called for in some embodiments, the AAA server 121 can be
     a management device in which the actual implementation of the traffic
     suspend/resume, firewall, routing, re-direction forwarding or traffic
     limiting mechanisms discussed in certain embodiments can be implemented
     in the base stations as discussed above or in another network element.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0110] In some embodiments, an activation server 160 (or other activation
     sequencing apparatus) provides for provisioning, as described below, of
     the devices 100 and/or network elements in the central provider network
     so that, for example, the device credentials can be recognized for
     activation and/or service by the network. In some embodiments, the
     activation server 160 provides activation functions, as described below,
     so that, for example, the devices can be recognized by the network, gain
     access to the network, be provided with a service profile, be associated
     with a service account and/or be associated with a service plan. As shown
     in FIG. 1, the activation server 160 is connected to the central provider
     core network 110. In this configuration, the activation server 160 acts
     as, an over the network or over the air, activation function. In some
     embodiments, the activation server 160, or variations of the activation
     server 160 as described below, is connected to apparatus in the
     manufacturing or distribution channel, or over the Internet 120, or as
     part of the service controller 122 to service provisioning or activation
     functions. In some embodiments, the activation server 160 is connected to
     the central provider core network 110. In some embodiments, the
     activation server 160 is connected to other network extensions such as an
     MVNO network or the Internet 120 if, for example, the routers in the
     service gateways or base stations have the capability to direct traffic
     from devices that are not fully activated or provisioned to an Internet
     destination, or if the service processor 115 is used for such direction.
     In some embodiments, the activation server 160 is included in the service
     controller 122.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0111] FIG. 2 illustrates another simplified (e.g., "flattened") network
     architecture including an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator)
     relationship in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, an open MVNO
     configuration is provided in a simplified network as similarly described
     above with respect to FIG. 1. In some embodiments, the service provider
     (e.g., service owner) is defined by the entity that maintains and/or
     manages the service controller 122 associated with and controlling the
     service processors 115 that are inside the devices 100 using the service.
     In some embodiments, the service controller 122 requires only a non-real
     time relatively low data rate secure control plane communication link to
     the service processors 115. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the service
     controller 122 servers can reside in any network that can connect to
     (e.g., be in network communication with) the Internet 120. For example,
     this approach provides for a more efficient provisioning of the equipment
     used to set up an MVNO partnership between the central provider and the
     service provider, and as shown in FIG. 2, an MVNO network 210 is in
     network communication with the Internet 120 just as with the central
     provider network 110 is in network communication with the Internet 120.
     As shown, the following are connected to (e.g., in network communication
     with) the MVNO core network 210: MVNO billing system 123, MVNO service
     controller 122, MVNO content management system 130, MVNO DNS/DHCP server
     126, MVNO AAA server 121, and MVNO mobile wireless center 132.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0112] By showing two service controllers 122, one connected to (e.g., in
     network communication with) the MVNO network 210 and one connected to the
     central provider network 110, FIG. 2 also illustrates that some
     embodiments allow two entities on the same access network to each use the
     service controller 122 and service processor 115 to control different
     devices and offer different or similar services. As described below, the
     unique secure communication link pairing that exists between the two ends
     of the service control link, 1691 and 1638 (as shown in FIG. 16), ensure
     that the two service controllers 122 can only control the devices
     associated with the correct service provider service profiles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0113] FIG. 3 illustrates another simplified (e.g., "flattened") network
     architecture including two central providers in accordance with some
     embodiments. For example, this provides for roaming agreements while
     maintaining rich services across different networks with completely
     different access layers. As shown, the mobile devices 100 are assumed to
     have a dual mode wireless modem that will operate on both a 4G network,
     for example LTE or WiMax, and a 3G network, for example HSPA or EVDO. One
     example roaming condition would be both Central Provider #1 and Central
     Provider #2 providing 3G and 4G network resources. In this example, the
     mobile devices 100 can connect to both 3G and 4G base stations 125 owned
     and operated by the central provider with whom they have signed up for
     service, or when neither is available from the central provider the user
     signed up with the device can roam onto the other central provider access
     network and still potentially offer the same rich service set using the
     same service profiles provided, for example, the roaming service costs
     are reasonable. In some embodiments, if roaming service costs are
     significantly more expensive than home network service costs, then the
     service processor 115 is configured with a roaming service profile that
     reduces or tailors service usage or service activity through a
     combination of one or more of user notification, user preference feedback
     regarding traffic shaping or service policy management preference
     collected and acted on by service processor 115, adaptive policy control
     in service processor 115 that tracks increasing roaming service costs and
     scales back service, or recognition of the change in network that causes
     the service controller 122 to configure service processor 115 of device
     100 with a roaming service profile. In some embodiments, in roaming
     situations, network selection can be based on an automatic network
     selection with network selection being determined, for example, by a
     combination of user service profile preferences, service provider roaming
     deals and/or available roaming network capabilities and cost, as
     discussed further below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0114] In some embodiments, the devices 100 are again assumed to be
     multimode 3G and 4G devices (e.g., the mobile devices 100 are assumed to
     have a dual mode wireless modem that will operate on both a 4G network,
     for example LTE, and a 3G network, for example HSPA or EVDO), with the
     devices 100 being billed for service by Central Provider #1 being, for
     example, EVDO and LTE capable, and the devices 100 being billed for
     service by Central Provider #2 being, for example, HSPA and LTE capable.
     For example, the devices 100 can roam using the 4G LTE network of the
     roaming central provider when neither the 3G nor 4G networks are
     available with the home central provider. As similarly discussed above
     with respect to the above described roaming embodiments, the service
     processors 115 and service controllers 122 are capable of providing
     similar services on the 4G roaming network and the 3G home network as on
     the 4G home network, however, the varying costs and available network
     capacity and speed differences of 3G home, 4G roaming and 4G home may
     also encourage the use of different, such as three different, service
     profiles to allow for the most effective and efficient selection and
     control of services based on the current network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0115] FIG. 4 illustrates a network architecture including a Universal
     Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) overlay configuration in
     accordance with some embodiments. As shown, FIG. 4 includes a 4G/3G/2G
     HSPA/Transport access network operated by a central provider and two MVNO
     networks 210 operated by two MVNO partners. In some embodiments, the
     central provider can offer improved service capabilities using a
     conventional UMTS network. As shown, the base stations 125 do not connect
     directly to the Internet 120, and instead the base stations 125 connect
     to the conventional UMTS network. However, as in various previous
     embodiments, the service processor 115 still connects through the secure
     control plane link to service controller 122. In some embodiments, the
     data plane traffic is backhauled across the various UMTS network routers
     and gateways as is the control plane traffic, and the IPDRs are obtained
     from the access network AAA server 121. Referring now to the 4G/3G/2G
     HSPA/Transport access network as shown in FIG. 4, the LTE/HSPA and
     HSPA/GPRS base stations/nodes 125 are in communication with 4G/3G/2G
     Service/Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs) cluster 410 via a radio access
     network 405, which are in communication with 4G/3G/2G Gateway GPRS
     Support Nodes (GGSNs) cluster 420 via an access transport network 415
     (e.g., a GPRS-IP network), which are then in communication with central
     provider core network 110.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0116] As shown in FIG. 4, as discussed elsewhere, service usage data
     store 118 is a functional descriptor for a network level service usage
     information collection and reporting function located in one or more of
     the networking equipment boxes attached to one or more of the
     sub-networks in the figure (e.g., RAN, transport and/or core networks).
     As shown in FIG. 4, service usage 118 is shown as an isolated function
     connected to the central provider core network 110 and the intention of
     this depiction is to facilitate all the possible embodiments for locating
     the service usage 118 function. In some UMTS network embodiments, the
     service usage 118 function is located or partially located in the GGSN
     gateway (or gateway cluster) 420. In some embodiments, service usage 118
     functionality is located or partially located in the SGSN gateway (or
     gateway cluster) 410. In some embodiments, service usage 118
     functionality is located or partially located in the equipment cluster
     that includes the AAA 121 and/or the mobile wireless center 132. In some
     embodiments, service usage 118 functionality is located or partially
     located in the base station, base station controller and/or base station
     aggregator, collectively referred to as base station 125 in FIG. 4 and
     many other figures described herein. In some embodiments, service usage
     118 functionality is located or partially located in a networking
     component in the transport network 415, a networking component in the
     core network 110, the billing system 123 and/or in another network
     component or function. This discussion on the possible locations for the
     network based service usage history logging and reporting function can be
     easily generalized to all the other figures described herein by one of
     ordinary skill in the art (e.g., RAN Gateway 410 and/or Transport Gateway
     420), and this background will be assumed even if not directly stated in
     all discussion above and below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0117] In some embodiments, a central provider provides open development
     services to MVNO, Master Value Added Reseller (MVAR) and/or Original
     Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners. In some embodiments, all three
     service providers, central provider service provider, MVNO #1 service
     provider and MVNO #2 service provider have service control and billing
     control of their own respective devices 100 through the unique pairing of
     the service processors 115 and service controllers 122. For example, MVNO
     #1 and MVNO #2 can each have open development billing agreements with the
     central provider and each can own their respective billing systems 123.
     As shown in FIG. 4, MVNO #1 core network 210 is in communication with the
     central provider core network 110 via the Internet 120, and MVNO #2 core
     network 210 is in communication with the central provider core network
     110 via an alternate landline(LL)/VPN connection 425. In some
     embodiments, the two MVNOs each offer completely different devices and/or
     services, and the devices and/or services also differ significantly from
     those offered by the central provider, and the service profiles are
     adapted as required to service the different devices and respective
     service offerings. In addition, the central billing system 123 allows all
     three service provider user populations to access ecommerce experiences
     from transaction provider partners operating transaction servers 134, to
     choose central provider billing options that combine their third party
     transaction bills on their service provider bill, and each subscriber
     population can experience a service provider specified look and feel that
     is unique to the respective service provider even though the different
     user populations are interfacing to the same transaction servers and the
     transaction partners do not need to require significant custom
     development to provide the unique central billing and unique consistent
     user experience look and feel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0118] In some embodiments, a central provider offers open network device
     and service developer services using one service controller server 122
     (e.g., a service controller server farm) and allows the open development
     partners to lease server time and server tools to build their own service
     profiles. The central provider also provides service billing on behalf of
     services to the open development partners. For example, this reduces
     costs associated with setting up an MVNO network for the open development
     partners and does not require the partners to give up significant control
     or flexibility in device and/or service control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0119] FIG. 5 illustrates a network architecture including an Evolution
     Data Optimized (EVDO) overlay configuration in accordance with some
     embodiments. This figure is similar to FIG. 4 except for the various
     particular variations of the EVDO network architecture as compared to the
     HSPA/GPRS wireless access network architecture as will be apparent to one
     of ordinary skill in the art. As shown, FIG. 5 includes an EVDO access
     network operated by a central provider and two MVNO networks 210 operated
     by two MVNO partners. The EVDO access network includes LTE/EVDO and
     EVDO/1xRTT base stations 125 in communication with Base Station
     Controller (BSC) packet control 508 and radio network controller 512 via
     a radio access network (RAN) 505, which are in communication with packet
     data service node 520 via an access transport network 515, which is in
     communication with central provider core network 110. As shown, a RAN AAA
     server 521 is also in communication with the access transport network
     515.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0120] In some embodiments, the central provider can offer improved
     service capabilities using a wireless access network. As shown, the base
     stations 125 do not connect directly to the Internet 120, and instead the
     base stations 125 connect to the wireless access network. However, as in
     various previous embodiments, the service processor 115 still connects
     through the secure control plane link to service controller 122. In some
     embodiments, the data plane traffic is backhauled as shown across the
     various network routers and gateways as is the control plane traffic, and
     the IPDRs are obtained from the access network AAA server 121.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0121] FIG. 6 illustrates a network architecture including a 4G LTE and
     Wi-Fi overlay configuration in accordance with some embodiments. This
     figure is also similar to FIG. 4 except for the various particular
     variations of the 4G LTE/Wi-Fi network architecture as compared to the
     HSPA/GPRS wireless access network architecture as will be apparent to one
     of ordinary skill. As shown, FIG. 6 includes a 4G LTE and Wi-Fi access
     network operated by a central provider and two MVNO networks 210 operated
     by two MVNO partners. The 4G LTE/Wi-Fi access network as shown includes
     LTE eNodeB and HSPA/EVDO base stations 125 in communication with Base
     Station Controller (BSC) packet control (EVDO &amp; 1xRTT) 608 and SGSN (HSPA
     &amp; GPRS) 612 via a radio access network (RAN) 605, which are in
     communication with System Architecture Evolution (SAE) Gateway (GW) 620
     via an access transport network 615, which is then in communication with
     central provider (core) network 110. As shown, a Mobile Management Entity
     (MME) server 619 is also in communication with the access transport
     network 615. Also as shown, a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) 602 is also in
     communication with the access transport network 615 via Wi-Fi Access
     Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) 604. As will be apparent to those of
     ordinary skill in the art, the embodiments of network architectures
     shown, for example, in FIGS. 1-8 are exemplary network architecture
     embodiments in which one or more of the shown network elements may not be
     required or included, alternative network elements included, and/or
     additional network elements included based on network design choices,
     network standards and/or other functional/design considerations and
     choices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0122] In some embodiments, the central provider can offer improved
     service capabilities using the wireless access network as depicted in
     FIG. 6. As shown, the base stations 125 do not connect directly to the
     Internet 120, and instead the base stations 125 connect to the wireless
     access network. However, as in various previous embodiments, the service
     processor 115 still connects through the secure control plane link to
     service controller 122. In some embodiments, the data plane traffic is
     backhauled as shown across the various network routers and gateways as is
     the control plane traffic, and the IPDRs are obtained from the access
     network AAA server 121. Accordingly, as shown in FIGS. 4 through 6,
     various embodiments can be implemented independent of the wireless access
     network technology, and for example, can be implemented in 3G, 4G and any
     other wireless access network technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0123] FIG. 7 illustrates a network architecture including a WiMax and
     Wi-Fi overlay configuration in accordance with some embodiments. This
     figure is also similar to FIG. 4 except for the various particular
     variations of a combined WiMax/Wi-Fi network as compared to the HSPA/GPRS
     wireless access network architecture as will be apparent to one of
     ordinary skill in the art. As shown, FIG. 7 includes both a WiMax and
     Wi-Fi network (e.g., a combined WiMax/Wi-Fi network) operated by a
     central provider and two MVNO networks 210 operated by two MVNO partners.
     Although the Wi-Fi and WiMax access technologies are different wireless
     access networking technologies, with WiMax providing a wide area
     networking technology and Wi-Fi providing a local area networking
     technology, which efficiently operates using the two wireless access
     networking capabilities. As similarly discussed above with respect to the
     switching between 3G and 4G networks, some embodiments employ the
     automatic network selection capability as described above to choose the
     best available network service profile, and, for example, the user can
     force the decision or the service controller can make the decision. For
     example, if free Wi-Fi services have adequate coverage, in most cases,
     the decision criteria programmed into the automatic network selection
     algorithm will select Wi-Fi as long as the Wi-Fi access points are
     associated with a known and trusted provider. In some embodiments,
     transaction billing from central provider billing system 123 or MVNO #1
     or MVNO #2 billing systems 123 will work with the transaction servers
     when connected over Wi-Fi just as when connected over any other access
     technology (including wire line based connections). The WiMax/Wi-Fi
     access network as shown includes WiMax base stations 125, Wi-Fi access
     points/hotspots 702 and/or Wi-Fi mesh access networks 702 (in some
     embodiments, femto cells can be used in addition to and/or as an
     alternative to Wi-Fi), and Wi-Fi access customer-premises equipment (CPE)
     704 in communication with WiMax service controller 708 and Wi-Fi service
     controller 712 via a radio access network 705, which are in communication
     with WiMax core gateway 720 via an access transport network 715, which is
     then in communication with central provider (core) network 110.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0124] In some embodiments, the central provider can offer improved
     service capabilities using the wireless access network as depicted in
     FIG. 7. As shown, the base stations 125 do not connect directly to the
     Internet 120, and instead the base stations 125 connect to the wireless
     access network. However, as in various previous embodiments, the service
     processor 115 still connects through the secure control plane link to
     service controller 122. In some embodiments, the data plane traffic is
     backhauled as shown across the various network routers and gateways as is
     the control plane traffic, and the IPDRs are obtained from the access
     network AAA server 121.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0125] Referring to FIG. 7, the Wi-Fi connection can be replaced with a
     femto cell (and the Wi-Fi modem shown in FIGS. 15D and 15E can be
     replaced with a femto cell modem (base station side functionality)). In
     some embodiments, the service processor 115 is provided on the femto cell
     to control subscriber access in a verifiable manner as similarly
     described herein with respect to various embodiments (e.g., the Wi-Fi
     related embodiments). For example, the femto cell service provider (e.g.,
     the entity that owns the spectrum the femto cell is using) can operate
     the femto cell as a local access mechanism for the home subscriber (or
     other who purchased or installed the femto cell), and then also use it to
     provide pay-for-service or additional free services, with controlled
     access and/or traffic control and/or service control and/or billing
     control performed locally or in combination with network equipment as
     described herein. In some embodiments, the WWAN devices being used at
     home or work with the femto cell include a portion of the service
     processor functionality. For example, this allows the service provider
     for femto cells to provide service and monetize service in a controlled
     way even though the femto cell is not connected to the service provider
     network the way conventional base stations are connected to the service
     provider network, but is connected through the Internet 120. For example,
     the secure heartbeat function can be extended to include data traffic so
     that it is encrypted and secured along with the control plane traffic.
     The decision of whether or not to admit a device onto the femto cell can
     be made through the service processor 115 connection to the service
     controller 122 and subsequent look up of the credentials for the device
     and the associated service plan and service profile that is then
     programmed into the service processor on the femto cell and/or the device
     itself. The femto cell can also offer a landing page to devices through
     the service processor so that devices that do not belong to the network
     can gain access to the network by signing up over the femto cell. For
     example, the intermediate device embodiments for Wi-Fi on one end and
     WWAN on the other can be accomplished by using the Wi-Fi connection in
     the cell phone in AP mode so that it becomes the intermediate device. The
     service processor 115 on the cell phone can then act in the same manner
     as described for the intermediate device as described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0126] FIG. 8 illustrates another simplified (e.g., "flattened") network
     architecture including multiple wireless access networks (e.g., 3G and 4G
     Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWANs)) and multiple wire line networks
     (e.g., Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) and
     Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) wire line networks) in
     accordance with some embodiments. It is a common network architecture for
     multi-access central providers to have one or more wired access networks
     and one or more wireless access networks. As shown, FIG. 8 includes both
     3G and 4G wireless access networks, including a 4G base station 125 and a
     3G base station 125, and both DOCSIS and DSLAM wire line networks (e.g.,
     a combined WWAN/wire line network), including DOCSIS Head End 125 and
     DSLAM 125, operated by a central provider via central provider (core)
     network 110 and an MVNO partner via MVNO network 210 via the Internet
     120.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0127] As shown, the service processor 115 can reside on a number of
     different types of devices 100 that work on 3G or 4G wireless, DSL or
     DOCSIS, and the service controller 122 is capable of controlling each of
     these types of devices with a consistent service experience, for example,
     using different service profiles, service capabilities and service
     profile cost options depending on which network the device is connected
     to and/or other criteria. For example, a download of a High Definition
     (HD) movie can be allowed when the service controller 122 is managing
     service profile policies for a service processor 115 residing on a DOCSIS
     device 100 (e.g., a computer or laptop connected to a cable modem), but
     not when the same service controller 122 is managing service profile
     policies for a service processor 115 residing on a 3G device 100 (e.g., a
     smart phone connected to a mobile 3G network).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0128] As will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view
     of the above description of FIGS. 1 through 8, the present invention can
     be provided across any access network and a set of service profiles can
     be defined in a variety of ways including, for example, to user
     preference feedback, access network performance, access network cost,
     access network central provider partnership status with the service
     provider central provider and roaming deals and costs. For example, as
     discussed below, various embodiments allow for users to have superior
     service experiences based on the ability to control certain of their
     service settings, and service providers can also more efficiently deploy
     a greater variety of services/service plans to users.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0129] In some embodiments, the service processor 115 and the service
     controller 122 provide an overlay for existing networks without
     significantly changing the billing system 123, gateways/routers or other
     network components/elements, and also provide verifiable service
     monitoring to control services and/or service usage/costs without
     involving, for example, a service provider or MVNO (e.g., for smart phone
     devices and/or laptops or netbooks (or any other network accessible
     device) with an unlimited data plan or any other service plan). For
     example, applications that are deployed by device owners or service
     subscribers (e.g., an IT manager) and do not involve a service provider
     include roaming services provided as an after-market product without
     carrier/service provider involvement. In this example, device activity is
     recorded by the service processor 115 and transmitted to the service
     controller 122 (e.g., the IT manager controls the service controller
     122). In another example, a third party after-market product is provided
     in which the service controller 122 is hosted by the third party and the
     device management entity (e.g., the IT manager or parents of the device
     user for parental controls) uses a secure Virtual Service Provider (VSP)
     website to control the devices that belong to that management entity's
     device partition (e.g., VSP partitions and techniques are described below
     with respect to FIG. 49). The VSP secure website techniques described
     herein can also be applied to service provider owned servers with device
     partitions for the purpose of controlling, for example, Deep Packet
     Inspection (DPI) controllers (e.g., DPC policy implementation 5402 as
     shown in FIG. 54) to provide similar or substantially equivalent service
     usage/control capabilities using network based service control
     techniques, as similarly described in detail below with respect to FIGS.
     49 and 54 (e.g., IT manager VSP control of a group partition and/or MVNO
     VSP control of a group partition).

   <br/>
   Service Processor Configurations for Devices
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0130] FIG. 9 illustrates a hardware diagram of a device 100 that includes
     a service processor 115 in accordance with some embodiments. As shown in
     FIG. 9, the service processor 115 is stored in a non volatile memory 910
     and a memory 920 of the device 100. As will be appreciated by those of
     ordinary skill in the art, the present invention can operate with
     virtually any device architecture, and the device architectures discussed
     herein (e.g., with respect to FIGS. 9-14 and 15A-15F) are examples of
     various implementations on certain devices (e.g., of different
     representations of device 100).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0131] As shown in FIG. 9, device 100 also includes a processor 930,
     sometimes referred to as a CPU or central processor unit, an APU or
     application processor unit, a core processor, a computing device, or many
     other well known terms. In some embodiments, device 100 includes one or
     more processors and/or a multicore processor. As shown, processor 930
     includes a sub-processor 935. In some embodiments, processor 930 and/or
     sub-processor 935 are based on an architecture sometimes referred to as a
     complex instruction set computer or CISC, a reduced instruction set
     computer or RISC, a parallel processor, a combination of two or more
     architectures or any other processor architecture. In some embodiments,
     processor 930 has a design that is based on logic and circuitry from one
     or more standard design library or published architecture, or includes
     specialized logic and circuitry designed for a given device 100 or
     collection of such devices. In some embodiments, a device includes more
     than one processor and/or sub-processor, and in such a device, one
     processor and/or sub-processor can have one architecture while another
     may have a somewhat different or completely different architecture. In
     some embodiments, one or more of the processors and/or sub-processors can
     have a general purpose architecture or instruction set, can have an
     architecture or instruction set that is partially general or partially
     specialized, or can have an instruction set or architecture that is
     entirely specialized. In some embodiments, a device includes more than
     one processor and/or sub-processor, and in such a device, there can be a
     division of the functionality for one or more processors and/or
     sub-processors. For example, one or more processors and/or sub-processors
     can perform general operating system or application program execution
     functions, while one or more others can perform communication modem
     functions, input/output functions, user interface functions, graphics or
     multimedia functions, communication stack functions, security functions,
     memory management or direct memory access functions, computing functions,
     and/or can share in these or other specialized or partially specialized
     functions. In some embodiments, any processor 930 and/or any
     sub-processor 935 can run a low level operating system, a high level
     operating system, a combination of low level and high level operating
     systems, or can include logic implemented in hardware and/or software
     that does not depend on the divisions of functionality or hierarchy of
     processing functionality common to operating systems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0132] As shown in FIG. 9, device 100 also includes non-volatile memory
     910, memory 920, graphics memory 950 and/or other memory used for general
     and/or specialized purposes. As shown, device 100 also includes a
     graphics processor 938 (e.g., for graphics processing functions). In some
     embodiments, graphics processing functions are performed by processor 930
     and/or sub-processor 935, and a separate graphics process 938 is not
     included in device 100. As shown in FIG. 9, device 100 includes the
     following modems: wire line modem 940, WWAN modem 942, USB modem 944,
     Wi-Fi modem 946, Bluetooth modem 948, and Ethernet modem 949. In some
     embodiments, device 100 includes one or more of these modems and/or other
     modems (e.g., for other networking/access technologies). In some
     embodiments, some or all of the functions performed by one or more of
     these modems are performed by the processor 930 and/or sub processor 935.
     For example, processor 930 can implement some or all of certain WWAN
     functional aspects, such as the modem management, modem physical layer
     and/or MAC layer DSP, modem I/O, modem radio circuit interface, or other
     aspects of modem operation. In some embodiments, processor 930 as
     functionality discussed above is provided in a separate specialized
     processor as similarly shown with respect to the graphics and/or
     multimedia processor 938.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0133] As also shown in FIG. 9, device 100 includes an internal (or
     external) communication bus structure 960. The internal communication bus
     structure 960 generally connects the components in the device 100 to one
     another (e.g., allows for intercommunication). In some embodiments, the
     internal communication bus structure 960 is based on one or more general
     purpose buses, such as AMBA, AHP, USB, PCIe, GPIO, UART, SPI, I.sup.2C,
     Fire wire, DisplayPort, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, IRDA, and/or
     any other bus and/or I/O standards (open or proprietary). In some
     embodiments, the bus structure is constructed with one or more custom
     serial or parallel interconnect logic or protocol schemes. As will be
     apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, any of these or other bus
     schemes can be used in isolation and/or in combination for various
     interconnections between device 100 components.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0134] In some embodiments, all or a portion of the service processor 115
     functions disclosed herein are implemented in software. In some
     embodiments, all or a portion of the service processor 115 functions are
     implemented in hardware. In some embodiments, all or substantially all of
     the service processor 115 functionality (as discussed herein) is
     implemented and stored in software that can be performed on (e.g.,
     executed by) various components in device 100. FIG. 9 illustrates an
     embodiment in which service processor 115 is stored in device memory, as
     shown, in memory 920 and/or non-volatile memory 910, or a combination of
     both. In some embodiments, it is advantageous to store or implement
     certain portions or all of service processor 115 in protected or secure
     memory so that other undesired programs (and/or unauthorized users) have
     difficulty accessing the functions or software in service processor 115.
     In some embodiments, service processor 115, at least in part, is
     implemented in and/or stored on secure non-volatile memory (e.g., non
     volatile memory 930 can be secure non-volatile memory) that is not
     accessible without pass keys and/or other security mechanisms. In some
     embodiments, the ability to load at least a portion of service processor
     115 software into protected non-volatile memory also requires a secure
     key and/or signature and/or requires that the service processor 115
     software components being loaded into non-volatile memory are also
     securely encrypted and appropriately signed by an authority that is
     trusted by a secure software downloader function, such as service
     downloader 1663 as discussed below (and as shown in FIG. 16). In some
     embodiments, a secure software download embodiment also uses a secure
     non-volatile memory. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also
     appreciate that all memory can be on-chip, off-chip, on-board and/or
     off-board. In some embodiments, the service processor 115 which as shown
     in FIG. 9 is stored or implemented in non volatile memory 910 and memory
     920, can be implemented in part on other components in device 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0135] As shown, device 100 also includes a user interfaces device
     component 980 for communicating with user interface devices (e.g.,
     keyboards, displays and/or other interface devices) and other I/O devices
     component 985 for communicating with other I/O devices. User interface
     devices, such as keyboards, display screens, touch screens, specialized
     buttons or switches, speakers, and/or other user interface devices
     provide various interfaces for allowing one or more users to use the
     device 100.

   [0136] FIG. 10 illustrates another hardware diagram of a device 100 that
     includes a service processor 115 in accordance with some embodiments. As
     shown in FIG. 10, the service processor 115 is implemented on the
     processor 930 of the device 100. In some embodiments, this implementation
     can be in part or whole accomplished in software stored, implemented
     and/or executed on the processor 930. In some embodiments, the
     implementation and/or execution can be in part or whole accomplished in
     hardware that is on the processor 930. While the service processor 115 is
     shown in FIG. 10 as stored, implemented and/or executed on the processor
     930, in other embodiments, the service processor 115 is implemented in
     part on other components in device 100, for example, as discussed below.

   Service Processor Implemented on a Communications Modem
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0137] FIG. 11 illustrates another hardware diagram of a device 100 that
     includes a service processor 115 in accordance with some embodiments. As
     shown in FIG. 11, the service processor 115 is implemented on the WWAN
     modem 942 of the device 100. In some embodiments, this implementation can
     be in part or whole accomplished in software stored, implemented and/or
     executed on the WWAN modem 942. In some embodiments, the implementation
     and/or execution can be in part or whole accomplished in hardware that is
     on the WWAN modem 942. In some embodiments, service process 115 is
     implemented on another modem component of device 100 and/or one or more
     of the modem components of device 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0138] In some embodiments, the service processor 115 is implemented on a
     modem processor (e.g., WWAN modem 942 or WWAN/Wi-Fi modem), and the
     service processor 115 can be installed and/or executed in protected
     and/or secure memory or processor hardware on the modem. The modem memory
     can be made robust to hacking or tampering and, in some embodiments, is
     only accessible from a secure network management channel or secure device
     management port and not by most end users. In some embodiments, a portion
     of the service processor 115 is implemented on a modem processor (e.g.,
     WWAN modem 942 hardware or software), and a portion of the service
     processor 115 is implemented on another device 100 processor 930. For
     example, the device service monitor agent 1696 and one or more service
     usage measurement points (see discussion associated with FIG. 21) can be
     implemented on a modem processor, and other service processor 115
     elements can be implemented in the main device operating system processor
     930. As another example, a second (or first) service monitor agent 1696
     and one or more service usage measurement points can be implemented on a
     modem processor, and a first (or second) service monitor 1696 with one or
     more service measurement points can be implemented on the main operating
     system processor 930 for device 100. For example, such embodiments can be
     configured to provide a service usage measurement and reporting system
     that offers a diversified countermeasure to protect against hacking,
     tampering or other errors for device based service usage measurements
     that can be made harder to hack or tamper with than certain software
     embodiments on the processor 930. For example, such embodiments can be
     employed when one or more of the following capabilities are not
     available: network based service usage measures, network based service
     profile or policy implementation verification measures, and network based
     service usage verification error response action capabilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0139] In some embodiments, certain portions of the service processor 115
     that deal with application layer service monitoring or traffic flow
     identification (e.g., tagging or traffic flow shaping as disclosed
     elsewhere) are implemented on a main processor 930, and other portions of
     the service processor 115 are implemented on a modem processor (e.g.,
     WWAN modem 942).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0140] In some embodiments, the WWAN modem is a wide area access
     technology modem such as 2G, 2.5G, 3G or 4G. As discussed above and
     below, the connection to the WWAN modem 942 can be a connection internal
     to device 100, for example a USB, GPIO, AMBA or other bus, or can be a
     connection that extends external to the device such as for example a USB,
     Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other LAN or PAN connection. Three example
     embodiments in which the bus is internal to the device are as follows: a
     PCIe modem card running over USB or PCIe, a GPIO connection running from
     a processor 930 chipset to a modem chipset inside a mobile device, or a
     Wi-Fi connection running from a Wi-Fi modem inside of device 100 to an
     intermediate modem or networking device combination that forwards the
     access network traffic between the access network connection and the
     device via the Wi-Fi connection. In some embodiments, in addition to the
     service processor 115 being implemented on the WWAN modem 942 either
     internal or external to the device 100, similarly service processor 115
     can be implemented on a wire line modem 940, such as DSL, Cable or fiber,
     another wireless LAN or PAN modem, such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth modem
     948, White Space, or some other modem, connected internal to device 100
     or external to device 100 via a LAN or PAN extension of internal or
     external communications bus structure 960.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0141] In some embodiments, a complete turn-key reference design product
     for the device modem (one or more of 942, 946, 948, 949, 944, 940)
     combined with a built-in service processor 115, possibly with a well
     defined and documented application interface and a well defined and
     documented service processor developers kit (SPDK) provides for a
     powerful product embodiment for the purpose of achieving mass market
     distribution and usage for the modem with service processor 115 and
     associated service controller 122 features. For example, embodiments that
     include the WWAN modem 942, possibly in combination with one or more
     additional modems including Wi-Fi modem 946, bluetooth modem 948, USB
     modem 944 and Ethernet modem 949, can be combined with a pre-tested or
     pre-certified integrated embodiment of the service processor 115,
     possibly in combination with a well defined API for writing software
     applications that interface to, reside on or communicate with this
     turn-key modem embodiment. As disclosed herein, the advantageous
     capabilities of the service processor 115, possibly in conjunction with
     the service controller 122, to assist in monitoring, control, billing and
     verification for services is made more available for device 100
     manufacturers in such a form, because the manufacturers do not need to
     spend as much time and resources to develop a custom modem only for a
     subset of devices that the turn-key modem can be used to support. In some
     embodiments, the service processor 115, as discussed herein, can be
     configured to provide device assisted service monitoring, control,
     billing and/or verification across not just when connected to the WWAN
     network via the WWAN modem, but also when connected to the other networks
     corresponding to the other access modems included in the turn-key
     combined module plus service processor 115 (or SPDK or chipset plus
     service processor 115) design. The pre-integrated service processor 115
     and API possibly in combination with testing and certification can be
     packaged in a small form factor that may have standardized interfaces
     such as USB, PCIe, firewire, Display Port, GPIO, or other interface. The
     form factor may be miniaturized into standard configurations such as
     minicard, half minicard or even smaller form factors, or it can be
     designed into a non-standard or proprietary form factor. The module form
     factor can be well documented to simplify integration into various device
     100 designs. The SPDK embodiments can be designed to contain one or more
     of the following: hardware integration and use documentation, software
     integration documentation, software programming documentation,
     application interface documentation, service controller documentation,
     overall testing guidelines and overall use guidelines. In some
     embodiments, the modem module can be integrated with the service
     processor 115 functionality as a combined chipset, firmware and/or
     software product, with other SPDK features very similar to those listed
     above. The service controller programming guide for these turn-key
     embodiments can also be documented for the SPDK service processor 115
     software, turn-key module with service processor 115 or integrated
     chipset with service processor 115. Accordingly, these embodiments
     provide various solutions to simplify the OEM task of integrating,
     developing, testing and shipping device 100 products (or integrated
     networking device products) with any of the device assisted service
     monitoring, control, billing or verification capabilities disclosed
     herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0142] FIG. 12 illustrates another hardware diagram of a device 100 that
     includes a service processor 115 in accordance with some embodiments. As
     shown in FIG. 12, the service processor 115 is implemented on the other
     I/O devices component 980 of the device 100. In some embodiments, this
     implementation can be in part or whole accomplished in software stored,
     implemented and/or executed on the other I/O devices component 980 (e.g.,
     a SIM/USIM card or other secure hardware I/O device). In some
     embodiments, the implementation and/or execution can be in part or whole
     accomplished in hardware that is on the other I/O devices component 980.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0143] As discussed above, various embodiments include product designs in
     which the service processor 115 resides on device volatile or
     non-volatile memory (see FIG. 9), the device application processor or CPU
     (see FIG. 10), the wireless access modem (see FIG. 11) (or any other
     modem), or another I/O device (see FIG. 12). While these are just a few
     of the example service processor 115 placement embodiments, these
     embodiments show that the placement of where the software or hardware for
     implementing the service processor 115 can reside in the device 100 is
     very flexible and can be implemented in a myriad of places and ways
     depending on the device and/or other technical design choices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0144] FIG. 13 illustrates another hardware diagram of a device 100 that
     includes a service processor 115 implemented in external memory of a
     System On Chip (SOC) 1310 in accordance with some embodiments. As shown
     in FIG. 13, the service processor 115 is implemented on the external
     memory 1320 of the device 100. In some embodiments, this implementation
     can be in part or whole accomplished in software stored, implemented
     and/or executed on the external memory 1320. In some embodiments, the
     implementation and/or execution can be in part or whole accomplished in
     hardware that is on the external memory 1320. In some embodiments, SOC
     chipset 1310 and external memory 1320 provide a portion or all of the
     hardware of device 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0145] FIG. 14 illustrates another hardware diagram of a device 100 that
     includes a service processor 115 implemented in external memory of a
     System On Chip (SOC) 1310 in accordance with some embodiments. As shown,
     the service processor 115 is stored in a non volatile memory 910 and a
     memory 920 of the SOC chipset 1310, as similarly discussed above with
     respect to FIG. 9. In some embodiments, SOC chipset 1310 and external
     memory 1320 provide a portion or all of the hardware of device 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0146] As similarly discussed above with respect to FIGS. 9 through 12,
     various embodiments include product designs including the SOC chipset
     1310 in which the service processor 115 resides on internal volatile or
     non-volatile memory 910 of the SOC chipset 1310 (see FIG. 14), the device
     application processor or CPU 930 and/or sub processor 935, the modems
     940, 942, 944, 946, 948, and/or 949 (or any other modem), another I/O
     device 985, and/or external memory 1320 (see FIG. 13) (and/or any
     combinations thereof). While these are just a few of the example service
     processor 115 placement embodiments, these embodiments show that the
     placement of where the software or hardware for implementing the service
     processor 115 can reside in the SOC chipset 1310 and/or the external
     memory 1320 of the device 100 is very flexible and can be implemented in
     a myriad of places and ways depending on the device and/or other
     technical design choices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0147] The above discussion with respect to FIGS. 9 through 14
     illustrating various internal hardware embodiments for device 100 applies
     equally to this partitioning of device functionality or any other
     partitioning of how the components in device 100 are configured, whether
     they are all separate components, some of the components are combined
     into a single chipset but there are still multiple chipsets, or all of
     the components are combined into a chipset. For example, FIGS. 9 through
     14 illustrating various internal hardware embodiments for device 100 show
     several access modem components including the wire line modem 940,
     wireless wide area network (WWAN) modem 942, USB modem 944, Wi-Fi modem
     946, Bluetooth modem 948, and Ethernet modem 949. In some embodiments,
     wire line modem 940 is a DSL or cable modem such as DOCSIS, or some other
     modem with a hard connection such as fiber. In some embodiments, as
     discussed above and below, connection to the wire line or wireless access
     network is accomplished through an extension of the internal or external
     communications bus structure 960. For example, such an extension is
     accomplished using one or the other modems, such as Wi-Fi modem 946 or
     Ethernet modem 949, connecting to a local area network that in turn
     connects to the access network via a device that bridges the local area
     network to the access network. One of ordinary skill in the art will
     appreciate that when discussing device connection to any access network
     the connection can be via a direct connection to the network, such as a
     3G or 4G WWAN modem 942 connection to a 3G or 4G WWAN network, or can be
     a connection to the access network through an intermediate connection,
     such as a Wi-Fi modem 946 connection to a modem or networking device
     combination that has a Wi-Fi LAN connection and a 3G or 4G network access
     network connection. Another example of an extended modem connection
     embodiment includes a Wi-Fi modem 946 device connection to a modem or
     networking device combination that includes a Wi-Fi LAN connection and a
     DOCSIS or DSL network access connection. Other examples of such
     combinations will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the
     art.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Service Processor Configurations for Intermediate Networking Devices
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0148] FIGS. 15A through 15F illustrate hardware diagrams of a device 100
     that include a service processor 115 and a bus structure extension 1510
     using intermediate modem or networking device combinations in accordance
     with various embodiments. For example, FIGS. 15A through 15E illustrate
     various extended modem alternatives for access network connection through
     an intermediate modem or networking device combination that has a
     connection (e.g., LAN connection) to one or more devices 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0149] In some embodiments, device 100 includes a 3G and/or 4G network
     access connection in combination with the Wi-Fi LAN connection to the
     device 100. For example, the intermediate device or networking device
     combination can be a device that simply translates the Wi-Fi data to the
     WWAN access network without implementing any portion of the service
     processor 115 as shown in FIG. 15B. In some embodiments, an intermediate
     device or networking device combination includes a more sophisticated
     implementation including a networking stack and some embodiments a
     processor, as is the case for example if the intermediate networking
     device or networking device combination includes a router function, in
     which case the service processor 115 can be implemented in part or
     entirely on the intermediate modem or networking device combination. The
     intermediate modem or networking device combination can also be a
     multi-user device in which more than one user is gaining access to the 3G
     or 4G access network via the Wi-Fi LAN connection. In the case of such a
     multi-user network, the access network connection can include several
     managed service links using multiple instantiations of service processor
     115, each instantiation, for example, being implemented in whole or in
     part on device 100 with the intermediate modem or networking device
     combination only providing the translation services from the Wi-Fi LAN to
     the WWAN access network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0150] Referring now to FIGS. 15A, 15C, 15D, and 15E, in some embodiments,
     the service processors 115 are implemented in part or in whole on the
     intermediate modem or networking device combination. In the case where
     the service processor 115 is implemented in part or in whole on the
     intermediate modem or networking device combination, the service
     processor 115 can be implemented for each device or each user in the
     network so that there are multiple managed service provider accounts all
     gaining access through the same intermediate modem or networking device
     combination. In some embodiments, the functions of service processor 115
     are implemented on an aggregate account that includes the WWAN access
     network traffic for all of the users or devices connected to the Wi-Fi
     LAN serviced by the intermediate modem or networking device combination.
     In some embodiments, the central provider can also provide an aggregated
     account service plan, such as a family plan, a corporate user group plan
     and/or an instant hotspot plan. In the case where there is one account
     for the intermediate modem or networking device combination, the
     intermediate modem or networking device combination can implement a local
     division of services to one or more devices 100 or users in which the
     services are controlled or managed by the intermediate modem or
     networking device combination or the device 100, but the management is
     not subject to service provider control and is auxiliary to the service
     management or service policy implementation performed by service
     processors 115. In some embodiments, another service model can also be
     supported in which there is an aggregate service provider plan associated
     with one intermediate modem or networking device combination, or a group
     of intermediate modems or networking device combinations but where each
     user or device still has its own service plan that is a sub-plan under
     the aggregate plan so that each user or device has independent service
     policy implementation with a unique instantiation of service processor
     115 rather than aggregate service policy implementation across multiple
     users in the group with a single instantiation of service processor 115.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0151] As shown in FIGS. 15A and 15C, in some embodiments, device 100
     includes a Wi-Fi modem 946, a Wi-Fi modem 946 combined with a 3G and/or
     4G WWAN modem 1530 on intermediate modem or networking device combination
     1510, and the intermediate modem or networking device combination
     forwards WWAN access network traffic to and from device 100 via the Wi-Fi
     link. For example, the service processor 115 can be implemented in its
     entirety on device 100 and the service provider account can be associated
     exclusively with one device. This is an embodiment associated with one or
     more of FIG. 29, 31, 32 or 34 discussed below, in which the modem bus
     represents the Wi-Fi LAN connection via the Wi-Fi modem 946. Similarly,
     as shown in FIGS. 15A and 15D, such an implementation can be provided
     using a different access modem and access network, such as a 2G and/or 3G
     WWAN, DSL wire line, cable DOCSIS wire line or fiber wire line
     configuration in place of the 3G and/or 4G access network connection to
     the intermediate modem or networking device combination 1510. In
     addition, various other embodiments similarly use DSL as shown in FIGS.
     15A and 15E, USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, or another LAN or point to point
     connection from device 100 to the intermediate modem or networking device
     combination 1510.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0152] In some embodiments, a portion of the service processor 115 is
     implemented on the device 100, such as the application interface agent
     1693 and other supporting agents (see FIG. 16), and another portion of
     the service provider 115 is implemented on the intermediate modem or
     networking device combination, such as policy implementation agent 1690
     or possibly modem firewall 1655 as well as other agents (see FIG. 16).
     This is an embodiment associated with one or more of FIG. 30 or 36
     discussed below, in which the modem bus in the figure represents the
     Wi-Fi LAN connection via the Wi-Fi modem 946. In this example, the
     service provider 115 can still offer individual service plans associated
     exclusively with one device, or can offer an aggregate plan in which the
     portion of the service processor 115 located on the intermediate modem or
     networking device combination 1510 aggregates service plans into one WWAN
     connection but each individual device 100 has a unique service interface
     via the application interface agents and associated agents located on
     device 100. Similarly, such an implementation can be provided using a
     different access modem and access network, for example a 2G and/or 3G
     WWAN, DSL wire line, cable DOCSIS wire line or fiber wire line
     configuration in place of the 3G and/or 4G access network connection to
     the intermediate modem or networking device combination 1510. In
     addition, various other embodiments similarly use USB, Ethernet,
     Bluetooth, or another LAN or point to point connection from device 100 to
     the intermediate modem or networking device combination 1510.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0153] In some embodiments, all of the service processor 115 is
     implemented on the intermediate modem or networking device combination
     1510 and the aggregate device or user traffic demand from the LAN port is
     serviced through one service provider service plan account. This is an
     embodiment associated with FIG. 35 in which as discussed below the modem
     bus in the figure represents the Wi-Fi LAN connection via the Wi-Fi modem
     946. Similarly, such an implementation can be provided using a different
     access modem and access network, for example a 2G and/or 3G WWAN, DSL
     wire line, cable DOCSIS wire line or fiber wire line configuration in
     place of the 3G and/or 4G access network connection to the intermediate
     modem or networking device combination 1510. In addition, various other
     embodiments similarly use USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, or another LAN or
     point to point connection from device 100 to the intermediate modem or
     networking device combination 1510.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0154] In some embodiments, the device 100 uses the on-board WWAN modem
     942 when it is outside of Wi-Fi LAN coverage area for one or more trusted
     access networks for the device, and when the device comes within range of
     a Wi-Fi network associated with a intermediate modem or networking device
     combination connected to a trusted wire line access network, the device
     can switch to the Wi-Fi link service to connect service processor 115 to
     the trusted wire line access network. In some embodiments, the decision
     to switch to the Wi-Fi LAN associated with a trusted wire line access
     network can be made automatically by the device based on the policy
     implementation rules settings for the modem selection and control 1811
     and/or the policy control agent 1692, can be made by the user, or can be
     made by the service controller 122 (see FIG. 18). In addition, various
     other embodiments similarly use USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, or another LAN
     or point to point connection from device 100 to the intermediate modem or
     networking device combination 1510.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0155] FIG. 15F illustrates another hardware diagram of a device 100 that
     includes a service processor 115 and a bus structure extension 1510 using
     intermediate modem or networking device combinations in accordance with
     various embodiments. In some embodiments, more than one access network
     connection is implemented in the intermediate modem or networking device
     combination 1510. This allows the device 100 to potentially connect
     through the intermediate modem or networking device combination with a
     choice of access network services. An example of such an embodiment is
     illustrated in FIG. 15F in which an access network router (e.g., an
     enterprise router) connected to a LAN with a wire line primary backhaul
     connection and a back up WWAN connection, for example 3G or 4G, to
     provide access services when the primary wire line connection fails. As
     discussed above, the service provider service profile for service
     processor 115 and the service plan account can be set up as an aggregate
     account with multiple users connected to the LAN. The service provider
     can elect to use an embodiment that includes a portion of the service
     processor 115 on each device 100 so that the account can be managed for
     each user or each device, or the service provider can elect to implement
     all of the necessary features in the service processor 115 on the
     intermediate modem or networking device combination so that there is no
     visibility to the individual devices 100 or users.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0156] As described herein, various embodiments provide many service
     policy implementation options that can enhance the service provider
     control of the service experience and cost, or enhance the user control
     of the service experience and cost by providing a verifiable or
     compromise resistant solutions to manage service policy implementation on
     the intermediate modem or networking device combination, for one or both
     of the WWAN or wire line access networks, when the WWAN access network is
     active, or when the WWAN access network is inactive. The level of service
     control, user preference feedback and service policy implementation
     verification or compromise resistance enabled by these embodiments
     improves the offered back up services and primary wire line services. One
     of ordinary skill in the art will also now appreciate that any number of
     wire line and/or wireless network access connections can be supported by
     the various embodiments as described herein, with any number of device
     architectures and architectures for intermediate modem or networking
     device combinations bridging the device to the access network of choice.
     Accordingly, various embodiments provide a verifiable managed service
     architecture, design and implementation for any number of single access
     and/or multi-access networks in which the service account can be
     consistent across multiple networks, and the service policies can be
     changed from network to network as deemed appropriate by the service
     provider with service notification, service cost control and privacy
     preference inputs from the user.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0157] In various embodiments, the verification embodiments discussed
     herein for service policy implementation verification or service policy
     implementation compromise protection can be applied. In some embodiments,
     rather than attaching a service provider service plan account to a single
     device, it is attached to (e.g., associated with) a user. For example,
     when the user logs onto an access network with a service controller
     controlled by a service provider, regardless of what device the user logs
     onto with the user's service plan profile can be automatically looked up
     in the central billing system 123 and dynamically loaded (e.g.,
     downloaded) onto the device 100 from the service controller 122 (e.g., a
     service profile provided on demand based on the user's identity). In some
     embodiments, in addition to dynamically loading the user's service policy
     implementation and control settings, one or more of the user's
     preferences including notification, service control, traffic monitor
     reporting privacy and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) reporting
     privacy are also dynamically loaded. For example, this allows the user to
     have the same service settings, performance and experience regardless of
     the device the user is logged into and using on the network. In addition,
     as discussed herein, in the various embodiments that call for roaming
     from one type of access network to another, the user service plan
     profile, that includes all of the above in addition to the service plan
     profile changes that take effect between different types of access
     network, can be used on any device and on any network, providing the user
     with a verifiable or compromise resistant, consistent service experience
     regardless of network or device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0158] Many of the embodiments described herein refer to a user using
     device 100. It is understood that there are also applications for these
     various embodiments that do not involve user interfaces. Examples of such
     applications include equipment, apparatus or devices for automation,
     telemetry, sensors, security or surveillance, appliance control, remote
     machine to machine data connections, certain remote access
     configurations, two way power metering or control, asset tracking, people
     tracking or other applications in which a human user interface is not
     required for device 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0159] Various embodiments of the device 100 described above include other
     I/O devices 985. In some embodiments, these other devices include other
     modems, other special purpose hardware components, and/or other I/O
     devices or drivers or modems to connect to other I/O devices. In some
     embodiments, these other devices include a Subscriber Identity Module
     (SIM) or Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) device. In some
     embodiments, it is advantageous to implement some or all of the service
     processor 115 functions on an embodiment of device 100 that includes a
     SIM and/or a USIM. In some embodiments, the other I/O devices 985 include
     a hardware device designed to implement a portion or all of the service
     processor 115 functions. For example, this is advantageous in cases in
     which the original device 100 was not manufactured with the service
     processor 115; in cases in which dedicated hardware is desired to improve
     one or more aspects of service processor 115 performance; allowing users,
     for example, to have the same service settings, performance and
     experience regardless of the device the user is using on the network by
     using such a SIM and/or USIM (e.g., or implemented as a type of dongle);
     and/or in cases in which a separate component is desired to assist in
     compromise protection for one or more aspects of service processor 115.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0160] As discussed above, some embodiments described herein provide for
     billing of certain access services. In some embodiments, various
     applications do not require or involve billing of certain services. For
     example, applications like enterprise IT (Information Technology) group
     management of enterprise workforce access policy implementation or access
     cost control or access security policy, privacy control, parental
     control, network quality of service control or enhancement, private
     network services, free access services, publicly funded access services,
     flat rate no-options service and other services, or other examples that
     will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art do not require
     billing functionality but benefit from many other aspects of various
     embodiments.

   Service Processor and Service Controller for Verifiable Service
     Monitoring, Notification and Control
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0161] FIG. 16 is a functional diagram illustrating a device based service
     processor 115 and a service controller 122 in accordance with some
     embodiments. For example, this provides relatively full featured device
     based service processor implementation and service controller
     implementation. As shown, this corresponds to a networking configuration
     in which the service controller 122 is connected to the Internet 120 and
     not directly to the access network 1610. As shown, a data plane (e.g.,
     service traffic plane) communication path is shown in solid line
     connections and control plane (e.g., service control plane) communication
     path is shown in dashed line connections. As previously discussed, it is
     understood that the division in functionality between one device agent
     and another is based on, for example, design choices, networking
     environments, devices and/or services/applications, and various different
     combinations can be used in various different implementations. For
     example, the functional lines can be re-drawn in any way that the product
     designers see fit. As shown, this includes certain divisions and
     functional breakouts for device agents as an illustrative implementation,
     although other, potentially more complex, embodiments can include
     different divisions and functional breakouts for device agent
     functionality specifications, for example, in order to manage development
     specification and testing complexity and workflow. In addition, the
     placement of the agents that operate, interact with or monitor the data
     path can be moved or re-ordered in various embodiments. For example, as
     discussed below in some embodiments, one or more of the policy
     implementation or service monitoring functions can be placed on one of
     the access modems located below the modem driver and modem bus in the
     communication stack as illustrated in certain figures and described
     herein. As discussed below, some simplified embodiment figures illustrate
     that not all the functions illustrated in all the figures are necessary
     for many designs, so a product/service designer can choose to implement
     those functions believed to be most advantageous or sufficient for the
     desired purposes and/or environment. The functional elements shown in
     FIG. 16 are described below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0162] As shown, service processor 115 includes a service control device
     link 1691. For example, as device based service control techniques
     involving supervision across a network become more sophisticated, it
     becomes increasingly important to have an efficient and flexible control
     plane communication link between the device agents and the network
     elements communicating with, controlling, monitoring, or verifying
     service policy. In some embodiments, the service control device link 1691
     provides the device side of a system for transmission and reception of
     service agent to/from network element functions. In some embodiments, the
     traffic efficiency of this link is enhanced by buffering and framing
     multiple agent messages in the transmissions. In some embodiments, the
     traffic efficiency is further improved by controlling the transmission
     frequency or linking the transmission frequency to the rate of service
     usage or traffic usage. In some embodiments, one or more levels of
     security or encryption are used to make the link robust to discovery,
     eavesdropping or compromise. In some embodiments, the service control
     device link 1691 also provides the communications link and heartbeat
     timing for the agent heartbeat function. As discussed below, various
     embodiments disclosed herein for the service control device link 1691
     provide an efficient and secure solution for transmitting and receiving
     service policy implementation, control, monitoring and verification
     information with other network elements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0163] In some embodiments, the service control device link 1691 agent
     messages are transmitted asynchronously as they are generated by one or
     more of the service agents. In some embodiments, the service control
     device link 1691 performs collection or buffering of agent messages
     between transmissions. In some embodiments, the service control device
     link 1691 determines when to transmit based potentially on several
     parameters including, for example, one or more of the following
     parameters: periodic timer trigger, waiting until a certain amount of
     service usage or traffic usage has occurred, responding to a service
     controller message, responding to a service controller request, initiated
     by one or more agents, initiated by a verification error condition,
     initiated by some other error or status condition. In some embodiments,
     once a transmission trigger has occurred, the service control device link
     1691 assembles all buffered agent communications and frames the
     communications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0164] In some embodiments, the transmission trigger is controlled by
     waiting for an amount of service usage, such as waiting until a certain
     amount of data traffic has passed, which reduces the control plane
     communication channel traffic usage to a fraction of the data plane
     traffic. For example, this approach preserves network capacity and
     reduces service cost even in traffic scenarios in which data traffic is
     light.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0165] In some embodiments, the transmission trigger is based on waiting
     for an amount of service usage, and also including a minimum transmission
     rate that triggers a transmission according to one or more of the
     following parameters: a maximum time between transmissions clock to keep
     the service processor 115 in communication with the service controller
     122 when little or no service usage is occurring, a polling request of
     some kind from the service controller 122, a response to a service
     controller heartbeat, a transmission generated by a service verification
     error event, or a transmission generated by some other asynchronous event
     with time critical service processor 115 (or service controller 122)
     messaging needs, such as a transaction or service billing event or a user
     request. For example, service control plane traffic down is reduced to a
     relatively inexpensive and capacity conserving trickle when device 100
     data traffic is not significant. At the same time, this approach also
     provides an effective flow of real time or near real-time service control
     plane traffic that is both cost and capacity efficient, because the
     service control plane traffic is a relatively small percentage of the
     data plane traffic when data plane traffic usage is heavy. For example,
     when data plane traffic usage is heavy is generally the time when close
     monitoring of service policy implementation verification or compromise
     prevention can be particularly important and by keeping the control plane
     overhead to a fraction of data plane traffic close monitoring and control
     of services are maintained at a reasonable cost in terms of percentage of
     both bandwidth used and network capacity. In some embodiments, the
     service usage or service activity trigger occurs based on some other
     measure than traffic usage, such as a number of messages transacted, one
     or more billing events, number of files downloaded, number of
     applications run or time that an application has been running, usage of
     one or more specified applications, GPS coordinate changes, roaming
     event, an event related to another network connection to the device
     and/or other service related measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0166] In some embodiments, the service control device link 1691 provides
     for securing, signing, encrypting or otherwise protecting communications
     before sending. For example, the service control device link 1691 can
     send to the transport layer or directly to the link layer for
     transmission. In some embodiments, the communications are further secured
     with transport layer encryption, such as TCP TLS (Transport Control
     Protocol Transport Layer Security) or another secure transport layer
     protocol. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted at the link
     layer, such as IPSEC (Internet Protocol Security), various VPN (Virtual
     Private Network) services, other forms of IP layer encryption and/or
     another link layer encryption technique.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0167] In some embodiments, the service control link 1691 includes the
     above discussed agent heartbeat function in which the agents provide
     certain required reports to the service controller 122 for the purpose of
     service policy implementation verification (e.g., verification related
     reports on certain aspects of the service processor 115) or for other
     purposes. For example, such agent heartbeat messages can be in the
     open/clear (unencrypted) or encrypted, signed and/or otherwise secured.
     In some embodiments, these messages include one or more of the below
     described types of messages: an agent information message, an agent
     check-in message and/or agent cross check message.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0168] In some embodiments, an agent information message is included in
     the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message,
     which includes, for example, any information the agent needs to
     communicate to the service controller 122 as part of the operation of the
     service policy implementation system. For example, an agent response to a
     service controller challenge, as described below, can be included in the
     agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0169] In some embodiments, an agent check-in message is included in an
     agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which
     includes, for example, a transmission of a unique agent identifier,
     secure unique identifier, and/or hashed encrypted and signed message
     beginning with some shared secret or state variable for the hash. For
     example, an agent self-check can be included in the agent heartbeat
     service policy implementation verification message, which includes
     reporting on agent configuration, agent operation, agent code status,
     agent communication log, agent error flags, and/or other agent associated
     information potentially hashed, encrypted, signed or otherwise secured in
     the message (e.g., using a shared secret unique to that agent).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0170] In some embodiments, an agent cross-check message is included in
     the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message,
     which includes, for example, reports on the status, configuration,
     operation observations, communication log or other aspects of another
     agent. For example, agent environment reports can be included in the
     agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which
     includes, for example, reports on certain aspects of the service
     processor 115 operating environment, such as software presence (e.g.,
     installation status of certain operating system and/or application
     software and/or components thereof), observed communication with agents
     or communication attempts, memory accesses or access attempts, network
     accesses or access attempts, software downloads or attempted downloads,
     software removal or download blocking, service policy implementation
     verification or compromise event error conditions with respect to the
     operating environment for the service processor 115, and/or other
     messages regarding the verification or possibility of compromise
     associated with the service processor 115 operating environment or
     agents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0171] In some embodiments, the agent heartbeat function also provides
     regular updates for information important to user service notification
     services. For example, the network based elements can provide regular
     synchronization updates for the device based service usage or service
     activity counters in which service usage or service activity measures
     available from one or more network service history elements is
     transmitted to the device 100. This allows the service usage counter
     errors between the device service counter and the counters used for
     central billing to be minimized. A common service usage or service
     activity measure is total traffic usage measured to date within a time
     frame over which a service limit is applicable. Other service usage or
     service activity measures can also be tracked and reconciled in a similar
     manner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0172] In some embodiments for the heartbeat function, the service
     controller 122 verifies that the scheduled agent reports are being
     received and that the reports are within expected parameters. In some
     embodiments, the access control integrity server 1654 issues signed
     challenge/response sequences to the policy implementation agent 1690. For
     example, the challenges can be asynchronous, issued when an event or
     error condition occurs, issued on a schedule or issued when a certain
     amount of data has passed. This approach, for example, provides a second
     layer of service policy implementation verification that strengthens the
     service usage or service activity measurement verification. For example,
     a challenge/response can be sent over the heartbeat link for the purpose
     of verifying device agent integrity. Various challenge/response related
     verification embodiments are described below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0173] In some embodiments, the challenge/response heartbeat message can
     include sending any kind of command or query, secure or transmitted in
     the open, receiving a response from the agent and then evaluating the
     response to determine if the response is within a range of parameters
     expected for a correctly configured agent, an agent that is operating
     properly, an agent that is not partially compromised or an agent that is
     not entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent is only required
     to respond with a simple acknowledgement of the challenge. In some
     embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a message or piece of
     information that is known by the agent. In some embodiments, the agent is
     required to respond with a message or piece of information that is
     difficult for the agent to respond correctly with if it were to be
     partially or entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent is
     required to respond back with information regarding the operation or
     configuration of the agent that is difficult for the agent to respond
     properly with if the agent is not properly configured, not operating
     properly, is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some
     embodiments, the first agent is required to respond back with information
     regarding the operation, configuration, status or behavior of a second
     agent that is difficult for the first or second agent to respond properly
     with if the first or second agent is not properly configured, not
     operating properly, is partially compromised or is entirely compromised.
     In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a response
     that includes a shared secret. In some embodiments, the agent is required
     to respond with information regarding the presence, configuration,
     operating characteristics or other information regarding other programs
     in the operating environment of the agent. In some embodiments, the agent
     is required to respond with hashed information to be portions of code or
     a code sample (e.g., the code portion or code sample can be specified by
     the service controller 122).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0174] In some embodiments, the information the agent responds with is a
     response to a signed or encrypted message from the service controller 122
     in which the agent must know how to decode the encrypted controller
     message in order to respond correctly or it would be difficult for the
     agent to respond properly if the agent is not configured properly, is not
     operating within appropriate limits, is partially compromised or is
     entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent signs or encrypts
     information in such a manner that it is difficult to respond correctly
     when the message is decoded by the service controller 122 unless the
     agent is configured properly, is operating within appropriate limits, is
     not partially compromised and is not entirely compromised. In some
     embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a signed or encrypted
     hash of information that is difficult for the agent to generate unless
     the agent is configured properly, is operating within appropriate limits,
     is not partially compromised and is not entirely compromised. For
     example, the hashed information can be local device configuration
     information, portions of code or all of the code, and/or the code portion
     to be used in the response can be specified by the service controller. In
     another example, the hashed information the agent responds with can
     include a shared secret, and/or the hashed information can be information
     regarding the presence, configuration, operating characteristics or other
     information regarding other programs in the operating environment of the
     agent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0175] Accordingly, as described above, the agent heartbeat function
     provides an important and efficient system in some embodiments for
     verifying the service policy implementation or protecting against
     compromise events. For example, there are many other functions the agent
     heartbeat service can perform and some are described herein while others
     will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the
     principles, design background and various embodiments provided herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0176] In some embodiments, the service control device link 1691
     facilitates another important function, which is the download of new
     service processor software elements, revisions of service processor
     software elements, and/or dynamic refreshes of service processor software
     elements. There are many embodiments for such operations. In some
     embodiments, the software is received as a single file over the service
     control device link 1691. For example, the file can have encryption or
     signed encryption beyond any provided by the communication link protocol
     itself. In some embodiments, the software files are segmented into
     smaller packets that are communicated in multiple messages sent over the
     service control device link 1691. In some embodiments, once the file(s)
     are received, or the segmented portions of the file(s) are received, they
     are communicated to a service downloader 1663 for file aggregation and
     installation, which, in some embodiments, is performed after further
     measures to verify the service processor software are completed. In some
     embodiments, the files are sent using other delivery means, such a direct
     TCP socket connection to the service downloader 1663 or some other
     software installer, which can also involve secure transport and
     additional levels of encryption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0177] As shown in FIG. 16, an agent communication bus 1630 represents a
     functional description for providing communication for the various
     service processor 115 agents and functions. In some embodiments, as
     represented in the functional diagram illustrated in FIG. 16, the
     architecture of the bus is generally multipoint to multipoint so that any
     agent can communicate with any other agent, the service controller or in
     some cases other components of the device, such user interface 1697
     and/or modem components. As described below, the architecture can also be
     point to point for certain agents or communication transactions, or point
     to multipoint within the agent framework so that all agent communication
     can be concentrated, or secured, or controlled, or restricted, or logged
     or reported. In some embodiments, the agent communication bus is secured,
     signed, encrypted, hidden, partitioned and/or otherwise protected from
     unauthorized monitoring or usage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0178] In some embodiments, as described below, there are multiple layers
     of security applied to the agent communication bus 1630 communication
     protocols, such as including one or more of the following: point to point
     message exchange encryption using one or more keys that are partially
     shared or shared within the service processor 115 agent group and/or the
     service controller 122, point to point message exchange that using one or
     more keys that are private to the two endpoints of the communication, a
     bus-level message exchange encryption that can be in place of or in
     addition to other encryption or security, or using one or more keys that
     are partially shared or shared within the service processor 115 agent
     group and/or the service controller 122, a set of secure messages that
     can only be decoded or observed by the agents they are intended for, a
     set of secure messages that allow communication between certain agents or
     service processor functions and entities outside of the service processor
     operating environment. In some embodiments, and as described herein, the
     service control device link 1691 is assumed to be equivalent to an agent
     for communication purposes, and, in the case of the service control
     device link 1691, the communication is not restricted to the agent
     communication bus 1630 but also extends to the service control
     communications link 1653. In some embodiments, the system has the
     capability to replace keys or signatures on occasion or on a regular
     basis to further secure against monitoring, eavesdropping or compromise
     of the agent communication system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0179] For example, various forms of message encryption and security
     framework techniques can be applied to encrypt and/or secure the agent
     communication bus 1630, including one or more of the following: agent bus
     encryption using shared key for all agents provided and updated by the
     secure server; agent bus encryption using point to point keys in which
     the secure server informs the bus and agents of keys and updates as
     appropriate; agent level encryption using agent to agent shared keys in
     which the secure server informs agents of the key and updates the key as
     appropriate; agent level encryption using agent to agent point to point
     key in which the secure server informs agent of the point to point keys
     that are required and updates the keys as appropriate; agent level access
     authorization, which only allows access to the agents that are on the
     secure authorization list and in which the list is provided by the secure
     server and signatures are provided by the secure server; UI messages are
     only analyzed and passed, in which the UI cannot have access to
     configuration information and cannot issue challenges; agent level
     heartbeat encryption, which can be point to point or shared key for that
     agent; control link level heartbeat encryption; TLS (Transport Layer
     Security) communication protocols; server level heartbeat encryption,
     which can be point to point or shared key for that secure server; and/or
     the access control integrity agent 1694 or heartbeat function can become
     point to multipoint secure communications hubs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0180] In some embodiments of the agent communication bus 1630, the design
     of the agent communication bus depends on the nature of the design
     embodiments for the agents and/or other functions. For example, if the
     agents are implemented largely or entirely in software, then the agent
     communication bus can be implemented as an inter-process software
     communication bus. In some embodiments, such an inter-process software
     communication bus is a variant of D-bus (e.g., a message bus system for
     inter-process software communication that, for example, helps
     applications/agents to talk to one another), or another inter-process
     communication protocol or system, running a session bus in which all
     communications over the session bus can be secured, signed, encrypted or
     otherwise protected. For example, the session bus can be further
     protected by storing all software (e.g., software components,
     applications and/or agents) in secure memory, storing all software in
     encrypted form in secure memory, and/or executing all software and
     communications within a secure execution environment, hardware
     environment and/or protected memory space. In some embodiments, if the
     agents and other functions are designed with a mixture of software and
     hardware, or primarily with hardware, then the implementation of the bus
     design will vary, and the principles and embodiments described herein
     will enable one of ordinary skill in the art to design the specifics of
     the agent communication bus 1630 to meet a particular set of product and
     desired functional requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0181] As shown in FIG. 16, an access control integrity agent 1694
     collects device information on service policy, service usage or service
     activity, agent configuration and agent behavior. In some embodiments,
     the access control integrity agent 1694 also cross checks this
     information to identify integrity breaches in the service policy
     implementation and control system. In some embodiments, the access
     control integrity agent 1694 also initiates action when a service policy
     violation or a system integrity breach is suspected. In some embodiments,
     the access control integrity agent 1694 also performs asynchronous or
     periodic agent checks to verify presence, configuration or proper
     operation of other agents. In some embodiments, the access control
     integrity agent 1694 also performs challenge-response sequence
     verification of other agents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0182] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     obtains service usage or service activity measures from a service monitor
     agent 1696 and compares one or more first service usage measurement
     points against one or more second service usage measurement points to
     verify service policy implementation. For example, as shown in FIG. 21,
     if the service usage at measurement point IV is inconsistent with
     measurement point III, which, for example, can indicate, for example,
     that an unauthorized or unmonitored usage of the access modem (e.g.,
     modems 2122, 2123, 2124, 2125 or 2141) is taking place. As another
     example, as also shown in FIG. 21, if one or more aspects of upstream
     traffic usage measurement point II, which represents the upstream demand
     side of policy implementation agent 1690, is inconsistent with upstream
     traffic measurement point III, which represents delivered traffic from
     the policy implementation agent 1690, then the policy implementation
     agent 1690 may not be operating properly. As another example, as also
     shown in FIG. 21, if service measurement point III and IV indicate that
     firewall agent 1655 is passing traffic to URLs or IP addresses that are
     in the blocked policy settings, then a verification error condition can
     be set for the access control policy. As another example, if the policy
     controller reports traffic usage statistics that are inconsistent with
     traffic usage policy settings, then a traffic usage policy verification
     error may have occurred. As another example, if the service usage counter
     synchronization information received from the service controller 122, the
     device service history 1618 and/or the central billing system 1619, is
     compared to the service usage history reported by the service monitor
     agent and the two are found to be outside of acceptable tolerance limits
     for the comparison, then there may be a verification error in the service
     monitor service usage or service activity accounting. There are numerous
     additional embodiments of such comparisons as described herein and others
     as will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the
     principles, design background and specific examples and various
     embodiments described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0183] In some embodiments, device service policy implementations are
     verified by comparing various service usage measures used at the device
     against expected service usage or service activity behavior given the
     policies (e.g., one or more service policy settings, service profile or
     service profile settings for network based access/services, and/or
     service plan or service plan for network based access/services). For
     example, verification is performed based on a measure of total data
     passed at the device as compared to the service policy for total data
     usage. For example, verification is performed based on a measure of data
     passed in a period of time at the device as compared to the service
     policy for data passed in such a period of time. For example,
     verification is performed based on a monitoring of communications from
     the device based on IP addresses as compared to the policy for
     permissible IP addresses. For example, verification is performed based on
     a measure of total data passed from the device per IP address as compared
     to the policy for total data usage per IP address. Other examples include
     such actual versus policy comparisons based on other measures at/from/to
     the device, such as location, downloads, email accessed, URLs, and/or any
     other data, location, application, time or other criteria or any
     combination of criteria that can be measured for comparing with various
     policy settings and/or restrictions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0184] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     monitors agent self-check reports to verify that agents are properly
     configured. In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     reports the agent self check reports to the service controller 122. In
     some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 performs a role
     in service usage test transmission, reception and/or monitoring, with the
     usage test being tailored to test monitoring or control aspects for any
     subset of service activities. In some embodiments, the access control
     integrity agent 1694 performs a role in billing test event generation
     and/or monitoring. In some embodiments, the access control integrity
     agent 1694 checks and reports the result of service usage monitoring
     verification tests, service usage billing verification tests and/or
     transaction billing verification tests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0185] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     receives agent access attempt reports to determine if unauthorized agent
     access attempts are occurring. In some embodiments, the access control
     integrity agent 1694 acts as a central secure communications hub for
     agent to agent or service controller 122 to agent communication. For
     example, the access control integrity agent 1694 can be used so that no
     other software or function can access other agents or so that agents
     cannot access other agents except through the secure point to multipoint
     communications hub. In some embodiments, this approach further enhances
     compromise resistance for the agents. In some embodiments, some or all of
     the agent communications, including agent to agent or service controller
     122 to agent communications, and possibly including unauthorized attempts
     to communication with agents, are monitored and logged so that a trace
     log of some or all agent communications can be maintained. For example,
     the agent communication trace log can be summarized and/or compressed for
     transmission efficiency or regularly reported, such as through the
     heartbeat function, or the agent communication trace log can be reported
     only when the service controller 122 requests the agent communication
     trace log or when there is a verification error event. As similarly
     described above, the partitioning of agent functions and server functions
     is provided herein mainly to aid in disclosing various embodiments but
     those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other
     partitioning of agent functions and server functions can be used based on
     different design choices. For example, the central agent communication
     hub function is performed in some embodiments by the access control
     integrity agent 1694, however, in other embodiments that function is
     performed by the service control device link 1691. For example, when the
     central agent communication hub function is located in the service
     control device link 1691, then architecturally the device link can be a
     single point to multipoint secure communications hub for all agent to
     agent and service controller 122 to agent communications. In some
     embodiments, this approach has certain advantages from a service policy
     implementation verification or compromise protection robustness
     perspective, or has certain advantages from a communications protocol
     efficiency perspective, or simply can be more efficient to implement. It
     should be noted that in other embodiments described herein the agent to
     agent and agent to service controller 122 communications can be
     multipoint to multipoint, with each agent having the capability to
     communicate with other agents or the service controller, this
     communication can be secure, signed or otherwise encrypted or protected
     in some embodiments and in the open/clear in others. Also, as discussed
     in some embodiments, the agents can maintain their own communications or
     attempted communications log, which can then be reported to the service
     controller 122. In some embodiments, the agents implement restrictions on
     which device components or agents the agents will conduct communications
     with so that only agents that need to communicate with one another can do
     so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0186] In some embodiments, the service control device link 1691 reviews
     local billing event history and compares such history to billing event
     reports to verify that a billing agent 1695 is functioning properly
     (e.g., has not been tampered with or compromised). In some embodiments,
     the service control device link 1691 cross-checks service usage or
     service activity against billing event reports from the billing agent
     1695 to verify that billing events are properly billing for service usage
     or service activity. In some embodiments, the service control device link
     1691 cross-checks transaction billing process or records against
     transaction billing reports to ensure that transaction billing events are
     being properly reported by the billing agent 1695. In some embodiments,
     the service control device link 1691 determines if one or more agents
     have been compromised, and if so, initiates a dynamic agent download
     process to replace any such potentially compromised agent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0187] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     verifies that the service usage counter is reporting service usage or
     service cost to the user within acceptable limits of accuracy when
     compared to the service usage reports obtained from the service monitor
     agent 1696, the service controller 122, the device service history 1618
     and/or the central billing system 1619. In some embodiments, the access
     control integrity agent 1694 checks to verify that user privacy filter
     preferences are being properly implemented. In some embodiments, the
     access control integrity agent 1694 checks to verify that the user is
     properly receiving UI warnings regarding service usage or roaming service
     usage conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0188] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 checks
     to verify that the device is not beginning service usage until it has
     been authenticated, authorized or granted access to the network. In some
     embodiments, access control integrity agent 1694 checks with the service
     controller 122 or the billing system 1619 to verify that the user or
     device has a valid service standing and should be admitted to access on
     the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0189] In some embodiments, an Activation Tracking Service (ATS) is
     provided in which the service monitoring function (e.g., performed by the
     service monitor agent 1696 and/or some other agent/component or
     combinations thereof on the device) is used in part to determine which
     access networks are being connected to and to record and/or report this
     information. In some embodiments, the ATS is only enabled if the device
     user approves reporting of access networks connected to by the user
     device. In some embodiments, the ATS is protected from tampering. For
     example, the ATS can be hardened, that is, to be more tamper resistant,
     using a variety of techniques, including any of the following: the ATS
     can be located (e.g., stored) in secure memory and/or secure hardware;
     the ATS can be implemented in the system BIOS, the access modem and/or
     another hard to access portion of the device; a second device agent can
     confirm the presence of the ATS with a report to a network based server;
     the second agent or the network server can initiate a reinstall of the
     ATS if it is missing or is found to be operating improperly; and/or the
     ATS can be placed in a secure area of the OS so that it cannot be removed
     or if removed must be replaced for proper device operation to resume. A
     variety of other tamper resistance techniques can also be used to protect
     the ATS from tampering as similarly described herein with respect to
     other device based functions/software components/agents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0190] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     verifies that ATS software or hardware is present, properly configured or
     operating properly. In some embodiments, the access control integrity
     agent 1694 reviews network connection or activity history and compares
     such to ATS reports to verify activation tracking service reports are
     occurring properly. In some embodiments, the access control integrity
     agent 1694 replaces ATS software if it has been removed. In some
     embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 monitors access or
     compromise of ATS software to determine if it may have been compromised.
     In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 reports
     status of ATS functions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0191] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 scans
     the local agent execution environment to determine if there are
     unauthorized accesses to service processor functions, settings or code.
     In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 monitors
     software loading activity, protected memory access or communication with
     service processor 115 agents to detect unauthorized changes to service
     processor software or configuration. For example, the access control
     integrity agent 1694 can have a local database of potentially malicious
     elements and compare entries in the database against the elements
     detected locally. As another example, the access control integrity agent
     1694 can communicate a list of some or all of the elements detected
     locally to the service controller 122 to augment or take the place of the
     database comparison function that may be performed locally. In some
     embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 detects new software
     downloads, installs or invocations and immediately issues an error flag
     report when potentially malicious software is downloaded, installed or
     invoked. In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     scans the local software loading and invocation activity along with a log
     of other software runtime events and regularly reports this trace so that
     when an error or compromise event occurs the trace preceding the event
     can be analyzed to determine the offending software or activity trace
     that took place to cause the compromise or error. Once the software or
     activity that caused the compromise is known, it can be entered into a
     refreshed version of the database that the device and other devices use
     to detect potentially malicious pre-cursor conditions. Examples of such
     pre-cursor events include software invocations, software downloads,
     attempts to uninstall certain agent and/or application
     software/components or OS components, a sequence of memory I/O events, a
     sequence of software access events, a sequence of network address or URL
     communications or downloads or a sequence of access modem I/O activity.
     In various other embodiments of the access control integrity agent 1694,
     the agent performs or (securely) communicates with other
     software/hardware device/network components that perform other well known
     signature, behavior blocking and/or intrusion detection
     identification/detection and/or blocking techniques based on the presence
     of potentially unwanted and/or potentially or known malicious software
     and/or intrusion attempts by unauthorized software and/or unauthorized
     users, using, for example, real-time, on access, periodic, and/or on
     demand scanning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0192] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     detects or blocks potentially compromising behavior of other software
     programs/users attempting unauthorized behavior in the service processor
     115 operating environment. In some embodiments, the access control
     integrity agent 1694 detects software that is being loaded that has the
     same or similar name, identification, memory location or function as one
     or more of the service processor 115 agents. In some embodiments, the
     access control integrity agent 1694 blocks operation or loading of such
     software. In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     detects or blocks unauthorized access of service processor 115 protected
     memory. In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     verifies configuration and operation of secure service downloader 1663.
     In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694 monitors
     network and I/O activity to detect potentially compromising events, such
     as a program that is downloaded from known detrimental or potentially
     suspect IP addresses or URLs or a program that accesses certain IP
     addresses or URLs. In some embodiments, the access control integrity
     agent 1694 scans of the service processor operating environment are
     recorded and kept for a period of time, and if a service policy
     verification error occurs, then the scans immediately prior to the error
     are analyzed or reported to the service controller 122 for analysis. In
     some embodiments, such scans are regularly reported to the service
     controller 122 without the presence of service policy verification error
     conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0193] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     requests a dynamic agent download of certain critical service processor
     functions, including in some cases the access control integrity agent
     1694 on a periodic basis, or on a periodic basis when network access
     activity is not required or minimal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0194] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     determines if a threshold has been surpassed for a max usage trigger for
     ambient and/or other services that should not be using significant
     amounts of data (e.g., based on the type of device and/or service profile
     settings).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0195] In some embodiments, the access control integrity agent 1694
     determines if verification errors exist in one or more of the
     verification process embodiments and, in some embodiments, reports errors
     immediately or in the next agent heartbeat to the service controller 122.
     In some embodiments, any number of results from the above checks,
     monitoring activities, reports or tests are reported to the service
     controller 122.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0196] In some embodiments, a policy control agent 1692 receives policy
     instructions from the service controller 122 and/or the user via the
     billing agent 1695 and adapts device service policy settings (e.g.,
     instantaneous device service policy settings) in one or more of the
     following agents/components: a policy implementation agent 1690, the
     modem firewall 1655 and/or an application interface agent 1693. As shown
     in FIG. 16, the modem firewall 1655 is in communication with a modem
     driver 1640, which is in communication with the agent communication bus
     1630 and access network 1610. As shown with respect to access network
     1610, a central billing server 1619, an access network AAA server 1621
     and device server history 1618 are also provided. As shown, the Internet
     120 is accessible via the access network 1610 and firewall 124, from
     which device 100 can then access various Internet services 1615.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0197] In some embodiments, the policy control agent 1692 adapts low level
     service policy rules/settings to perform one or more of the following
     objectives: achieve higher level service usage or cost objectives, reduce
     network control channel capacity drain, reduce network control plane
     server processing bandwidth, and/or provide a higher level of user
     privacy or network neutrality while satisfying service usage or service
     activity objectives. In some embodiments, the policy control agent 1692
     performs a policy control function to adapt instantaneous service
     policies to achieve a service usage objective. In some embodiments, the
     policy control agent 1692 receives service usage information from the
     service monitor agent 1696 to evaluate service usage history as compared
     to service usage goals. In some embodiments, the policy control agent
     1692 uses service monitor 1696 service usage or service activity history
     and various possible algorithm embodiments to create an estimate of the
     future projected service usage. In some embodiments, the policy control
     agent 1692 uses a future projection of service usage to determine what
     service usage or service activity controls need to be changed to maintain
     service usage goals. In some embodiments, the policy control agent 1692
     uses service usage history to perform a service usage or service activity
     analysis to determine the distribution of service usage across service
     usage elements within categories, such as usage by application, usage by
     URL, usage by address, usage by content type, usage by time of day, usage
     by access network, usage by location, and/or any other categories for
     classifying service usage. In some embodiments, the policy control agent
     1692 uses the service usage distribution analysis to determine which
     service usage elements or service activities are creating the largest
     service usage (e.g., if e-mail, social networking, or multimedia/online
     video application categories are creating the largest service usage).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0198] In some embodiments, the policy control agent 1692 is instructed,
     for example, by the user, through billing agent 1695 to perform a service
     control algorithm, such as traffic shaping or download management, to
     manage service usage or service activities to assist the user in
     controlling service costs. As a basic example of such a traffic shaping
     algorithm, the traffic shaping algorithm can simply reduce traffic speed
     for all applications and traffic types successively until the service
     usage projections are within service usage limits for the present service
     billing period. To illustrate an algorithm that is more sophisticated and
     provides the advantage of leaving many service usage elements or service
     activities unaffected while only controlling down usage on the most
     aggressive service usage elements or service activities, the traffic
     shaping algorithm can identify the highest traffic usage applications
     and/or websites and successively reduce traffic speed just for the
     highest usage applications and/or websites until the service usage
     projections are within service usage limits for the present service
     billing period. These examples thereby reduce network traffic for the
     user in accordance with the user's service usage objectives while
     maintaining overall satisfactory service usage experience for the user in
     a manner that satisfies various net neutrality requirements (e.g., the
     traffic throttling of certain applications/websites based on user input
     in which categories based on service usage history are selected by the
     user, for example, a certain application may be using 90% of the
     aggregate traffic usage). For example, adaptive throttling algorithms can
     be used to throttle application traffic that the user requests
     throttling, such as recursively throttling of the specified application
     traffic (e.g., to denigrate the traffic usage associated with that
     application and thereby reduce overall service data usage).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0199] In some embodiments, the policy control agent 1692 adjusts service
     policy based on time of day. In some embodiments, the policy control
     agent 1692 obtains a measure of network availability and adjusts traffic
     shaping policy settings based on available network capacity. In some
     embodiments, the policy control agent 1692 automatically and dynamically
     adjusts service policy based on one or more other service policy
     settings, the service profile and/or the service plan associated with the
     device and/or user of the device.

   <br/>
   [0200] In some embodiments, various lower level service policy
     implementation embodiments are combined with a higher level set of
     service policy supervision functions to provide device assisted
     verifiable network access control, authentication and authorization
     services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0201] In some embodiments, device based access control services are
     extended and combined with other policy design techniques to create a
     simplified device activation process and connected user experience
     referred to herein as ambient activation. In some embodiments, ambient
     access generally refers to an initial service access in which such
     service access is in some manner limited, such as where service options
     are significantly limited (e.g., low bandwidth network browsing and/or
     access to a specific transactional service), limited bandwidth, limited
     duration access before which a service plan must be purchased to maintain
     service or have service suspended/disabled or throttled or otherwise
     limited/reduced/downgraded, and/or any other time based, quality based,
     scope of service limited initial access for the network enabled device.
     In some embodiments, ambient activation is provided by setting access
     control to a fixed destination (e.g., providing access to a portal, such
     as a web page (e.g., for a hotspot) or WAP (Wireless Application
     Protocol) page, that provides the user with service plan options for
     obtaining a service plan for the user desired access, such as the service
     plan options for data usage, service types, time period for access (e.g.,
     a day pass, a week pass or some other duration), and costs of service
     plan(s)). In some embodiments, service data usage of the ambient
     activated device is verified using IPDRs (e.g., using the device
     ID/device number for the device 100 to determine if the device has been
     used in a manner that is out of plan for the service plan associated with
     the device 100, such as based on the amount of data usage exceeding the
     service plan's service data usage limits, out of plan/unauthorized access
     to certain websites, and/or out of plan/unauthorized transactions). In
     some embodiments, service data usage of the ambient activated device is
     verified by setting a maximum data rate in the policy control agent 1692
     and if/when it is determined that the device is exceeding a specified
     data rate/data usage, then the service data usage is throttled
     accordingly. In some embodiments, various other verification approaches
     are used for ambient activation purposes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0202] In some embodiments, the policy control agent 1692 (and/or another
     agent/component of the service processor 115 and/or service controller
     122) performs a service control algorithm to assist in managing overall
     network capacity or application QoS (Quality of Service). In some
     embodiments, the policy control agent 1692 (and/or another
     agent/component of the service processor 115) performs an access network
     selection algorithm to determine which access network to connect to based
     on connection options and determined strengths of available wireless
     networks, network preference or security settings, service usage cost
     based network preferences, and/or any other criteria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0203] Accordingly, as described herein with respect to various
     embodiments, service usage or service activities can be measured by
     various agents at various different measurement points, which provides
     for a more robust verification and integrity of device based services
     communication. For example, it is much less likely and more difficult to
     compromise and/or spoof multiple agents. As described herein, various
     verification and integrity checks are performed, including, for example,
     network based service usage measurement (e.g., using IPDRs); heartbeat
     monitoring; agent based heartbeat (e.g., challenge/response queries);
     agent operating environment protection; monitoring agent communications;
     agent cross-checks; comparing device based and network based measures
     (e.g., service usage measures); dynamic software/agent download; and/or
     any combination of these and various other verification/integrity check
     techniques described herein and/or apparent from the various embodiments
     described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0204] In some embodiments, the device 100 is capable of connecting to
     more than one network and device service policies are potentially changed
     based on which network the device is connected to at the time. In some
     embodiments, the network control plane servers detect a network
     connection change and initiate the service policy implementation
     established for the second network. In some embodiments, the device based
     adaptive policy control agent, as described herein (e.g., policy control
     agent 1692), detects network connection changes and implements the
     service policies established for the second network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0205] In some embodiments, when more than one access network is
     available, the network is chosen based on which network is most preferred
     according to a network preference list or according to which network that
     optimizes a network cost function. For example, the network preference
     list can be pre-established by the service provide and/or the user and/or
     later modified/adjusted by either the service provider and/or the user.
     For example, the cost function can be based on determining a minimum
     service cost, maximum network performance, whether or not the user or
     device has access to the network, maximizing service provider connection
     benefit, reducing connections to alternative paid service providers,
     and/or any other cost related criteria for network selection purposes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0206] In some embodiments, the device 100 detects when one or more
     preferred networks are not available, implements a network selection
     function or intercepts other network selection functions, and offers a
     connection to the available service network that is highest on a
     preference list. For example, the preference list can be set by the
     service provider, the user and/or the service subscriber. In some
     embodiments, a notification is provided to the device/user when the
     device is not connected to a network (e.g., indicating in a pop-up/bubble
     or other UI based display a notification, such as "You are not connected
     to the network. Click here to learn more, get free trial, use a session,
     sign-up for service"). In some embodiments, the notification content can
     be determined based on usage service patterns, locally stored and/or
     programmable logic on the device and/or a server (e.g., device reports
     that user is not connected and WWAN is available). Decisions on what
     bubble to present when may be in pre-stored logic on device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0207] In some embodiments, service policies are automatically adapted
     based on the network to which device 100 is connected. For example, the
     device can be a cellular communication based device connected to a
     macrocell, a microcell, a picocell, or a femtocell (e.g., femto cells
     generally provide a low power, small area cellular network used, for
     example, in homes or offices, which, for example, can be used as an
     alternative to Wi-Fi access). In some embodiments, service monitoring
     agent 1696 and/or billing agent 1695 modify service usage counting and/or
     billing based on whether the device is connected to a macrocell,
     microcell, picocell or femtocell. In some embodiments, the device
     recognizes which type of network it is currently connecting to (e.g.,
     looking up in a local or network table for the current base station
     connected to, and/or the information is broadcast to the device upon the
     connection with the base station), that is, whether it is a macrocell,
     microcell, picocell or femtocell. In other embodiments, the device does
     not recognize which type of network it is currently connected to, but
     reports its current base station, and the network uses a network lookup
     function to determine which type of network it is connected to. In some
     embodiments, the device adjusts the billing based on the type of network
     it is connected to, or in other embodiments, the device calculates an
     offset to such billing based on the type of network it is connected to,
     and/or in other embodiments, the device records such service usage
     associated with the type of network it is connected to and the network
     billing can adjust the billing accordingly. For example, the billing can
     be lower for service data usage over a femtocell versus a macrocell. In
     some embodiments, service policies are adjusted based on the type of
     network that the device is connected, such as billing, user notification,
     data usage/bandwidth, throttling, time of day, who owns the cellular
     network connection (e.g., user's home femtocell, or user's work
     femtocell, or a commercial business's femtocell like a coffee shop or any
     other common area like an airport) and/or any other service policy can be
     different for a femtocell connection (or for any other type of
     connection, such as a macrocell, microcell, or picocell). In some
     embodiments, the local service usage counter is adjusted based on the
     type of network (and/or based on the time of day of such service
     activity) that the device is connected, such as billing, user
     notification, data usage/bandwidth, and/or any other service policy can
     be different for a femtocell connection (or for any other type of
     connection, such as a macrocell, microcell, or picocell). In some
     embodiments, the service policies and/or billing policies are adjusted
     based on network congestion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0208] In some embodiments, if adaptive service policy control is not
     required, then the policy control agent 1692 can simply pass
     instantaneous service policy settings directly to the agents responsible
     for implementing instantaneous service policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0209] In some embodiments, a policy implementation agent 1690 implements
     traffic shaping and QoS policy rules for the device 100. In some
     embodiments, the policy implementation agent 1690 provides a firewall
     function. In some embodiments, the policy implementation agent 1690
     performs traffic inspection and characterization. In some embodiments,
     packet inspection is aided by literal or virtual application layer
     tagging while in other embodiments packet inspection is performed
     entirely in/by the policy implementation agent 1690. In some embodiments,
     the policy implementation agent 1690 accepts service policy
     implementation settings from the policy control agent 1692 or directly
     from the service controller 122. More detail on specific embodiments for
     the policy implementation agent 1690 is provided below with respect to
     the figures associated with communication stack and communication
     protocol flow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0210] In some embodiments, the burst size, buffer delay, acknowledgement
     delay and drop rate used in upstream and downstream traffic shaping are
     optimized with the goal of reducing access network traffic overhead, and
     excess capacity usage that can result from mismatches in traffic
     transmission parameters with the access network MAC and PHY or from
     excess network level packet delivery protocol re-transmissions. In some
     embodiments, the application interface agent 1693 is used to literally
     tag or virtually tag application layer traffic so that the policy
     implementation agent(s) 1690 has the necessary information to implement
     selected traffic shaping solutions. As shown in FIG. 16, the application
     interface agent 1693 is in communication with various applications,
     including a TCP application 1604, an IP application 1605, and a voice
     application 1602.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0211] In some embodiments, downstream literal or virtual application
     tagging are delayed until a traffic flow passes through the service
     policy implementation functions and to the application interface function
     where the service flow is then identified and associated with the
     underlying traffic and application parameters, and the literal or virtual
     tag is then communicated to the first policy implementation function or
     service monitoring function in the downstream traffic processing stack.
     In some embodiments, prior to being associated with a literal or virtual
     tag, the traffic flow is allowed to pass with no traffic shaping, and
     once the traffic flow is identified and tagged, the appropriate traffic
     shaping is applied. In some embodiments, a set of traffic shaping policy
     parameters are applied to the unidentified traffic flow before the flow
     is identified, and then the traffic shaping policy for the flow is
     updated when the flow is tagged. In some embodiments, the traffic flow
     can be blocked at the application interface agent even before the tag is
     passed to the policy implementation functions if it is found to be
     associated with traffic parameters that are blocked by policy once packet
     processing, framing and encryption are removed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0212] In some embodiments, a service monitor agent 1696 records and
     reports device service usage or service activities of device 100. In some
     embodiments, service usage history is verified by a number of techniques
     including verifying against network based service usage history (e.g.,
     device service history 1618) and the various service policy
     implementation techniques as described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0213] In some embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696 includes the
     capability to filter service usage history reporting with the decision on
     which aspects of service history to report being determined by policies
     including possibly privacy policies defined by the device user or control
     plane servers in the network. In some embodiments, the service monitor
     agent 1696 monitors and possibly records or reports Customer Resource
     Management (CRM) information such as websites visited, time spent per
     website, interest indications based on website viewing, advertisements
     served to the device, advertisements opened by the user, location of the
     user, searches conducted by the user, application usage profile, device
     user interface usage history, electronic commerce transactions, music or
     video files played, applications on device, and/or when the user is
     actively working or playing or inactive. In some embodiments, to protect
     the privacy of this user CRM information, the user is provided with
     options on how much of the information to share and the user's response
     to the options are recorded and used to determine the filtering policy
     for how much of the CRM data to report (e.g., CRM filter level options
     selected by the user via the device UI and/or via various service plan or
     service profile or service policy options) and how much to suppress or to
     not even monitor/record/store in the first place. In some embodiments, to
     protect the privacy of this user's GPS/location tracking related
     information, the user is provided with options on how much of the
     information to share and the user's response to the options are recorded
     and used to determine the filtering policy for how much of the
     GPS/location tracking related data to report (e.g., GPS/location tracking
     filter level options) and how much to suppress or to not even
     monitor/record/store in the first place. In some embodiments, the service
     processor 115 allows the user to provide feedback on the user's
     preferences, such as for privacy/CRM data to report. In some embodiments,
     the user can also specify their preference(s) for notification (e.g.,
     related to service usage/cost, traffic reporting and other service
     usage/monitored information) and/or service controls. In some
     embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696 observes and possibly records
     or reports service usage categorized by network possibly including
     roaming networks, paid service networks or free service networks. In some
     embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696 observes and possibly records
     or reports service usage categorized by sub-accounts for various types of
     traffic or various types of network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0214] For example, service monitor reports can be provided to the service
     controller 122. Service is monitored through various embodiments that can
     involve service usage logging or traffic inspection and usage logging at
     the application level, various levels in the networking communication
     stack or the access modem. Some embodiments involve multiple levels of
     service or traffic measurement at various levels in the communications
     stack as described further below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0215] In some embodiments, service or traffic monitoring includes
     monitoring one or more of the following: traffic associated with one or
     more users; traffic downstream and/or upstream data rate; total traffic
     received and/or transmitted over a period of time; traffic transmitted
     and/or received by IP addresses, domain names, URLs or other network
     address identifiers; traffic transmitted and/or received by email
     downloads or uploads; traffic transmitted and/or received by an
     application; traffic transmitted and/or received by network file
     transfers; traffic transmitted and/or received by file download or upload
     content types; traffic transmitted and/or received by mobile commerce
     transactions; traffic transmitted and/or received by one or more time
     periods; traffic transmitted and/or received by differing levels of
     network activity and network capacity availability; traffic transmitted
     and/or received by one or more delivered levels of quality of service;
     traffic transmitted and/or received by software downloads; traffic
     transmitted and/or received by application downloads; traffic transmitted
     and/or received by one or more activities associated with the service
     control plane link or other network related functions, or traffic that
     may not directly result in service usage or service activity that the
     user values or desires; traffic transmitted and/or received to support
     one or more service provider third party service partner offerings;
     software usage history; application usage history; device discovery
     history for UI components, applications, settings, tutorials; ads served
     history; ads visited history; and/or device location history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0216] In some embodiments, some or all of the service usage monitoring
     occurs at the application layer. In some embodiments, the service monitor
     agent 1696 implements traffic inspection points between the applications
     and the networking stack application interface, such as the sockets API.
     In other embodiments, the application interface agent 1693 performs
     traffic inspection and reports the results to the service monitor agent
     1696. Traffic inspection can be accomplished in several ways, including,
     for example, implementing a T-buffer at each socket connection and
     feeding the side traffic into a traffic flow analyzer, which in
     combination with a mapping of application to socket provides much of the
     information listed above. In cases in which it is necessary to obtain
     traffic information from the application itself, some embodiments call
     for the application to be adapted to provide the information to either
     the application interface agent 1693 or the service monitor agent 1696.
     As an example, the application interface agent 1693 or the service
     monitor agent 1696 can monitor and decode advertisements downloaded via
     HTTP, but if the browser and HTTP server employ security above the
     sockets protocol stack layer then the application interface agent can
     communicate with the browser via a java applet or some other
     inter-process communication method. In some embodiments, the service
     monitor agent 1696, the billing agent 1695 and/or the policy control
     agent 1692 (or some other software or hardware function on the device)
     can monitor and/or control (e.g., allow, block and/or replace)
     advertisement traffic flow into the device. In some embodiments, the
     monitoring and control of advertisement traffic flow into the device is
     also used for bill by account purposes (e.g., charges, such as service
     charges, billed to the advertiser, sponsor, and/or service or
     transactional service provider).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0217] In some embodiments, some or all of the service usage monitoring
     occurs below the application interface for the networking stack. In this
     case, some portion of the information listed above may not always be
     available due to encryption applied at the higher layers and/or the
     computational costs associated with performing deep packet inspection on
     mobile devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0218] In some embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696 is also
     monitors the operating software install or loading systems, and/or
     otherwise monitors software installs or loads and/or software
     uninstalls/deinstallations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0219] Some of the information above may be considered by some users,
     advocacy groups or agencies as customer sensitive personal information.
     Simply sending the above information to the network for unspecified
     purposes may not, therefore, be acceptable for some service providers.
     However, if the user provides specific approval (e.g., informed consent)
     for the device, network or service provider to use some or all of the
     information that may be sensitive for specified purposes, then the user
     can control the level of information that is used and the purpose the
     information is used for. Accordingly, various embodiments described
     herein provide the user with control of what information is used and the
     purposes it is used for thereby allowing the user adequate control of any
     such sensitive information. In some embodiments, information that is
     thought to perhaps be sensitive and is reported to the network must first
     receive user approval for the reporting. Some basic information is
     generally not considered sensitive and is necessary for certain basic
     service provider needs. For example, total data transmitted and/or
     received, traffic downstream and/or upstream speed, overall traffic usage
     by time of day are generally not considered private from the service
     provider's perspective and are necessary in many basic service policy
     implementations. As additional examples, perhaps other service usage
     history, such as total traffic email downloads and uploads but not the
     type of files or any specifics about the email traffic, the total web
     browsing traffic but nothing specific about the sites visited or content
     viewed, total file transfer traffic but not the type of files transferred
     or the addresses involved in the transfer, and other examples may not be
     viewed as private and, in some embodiments, provide valuable information
     for the service provider to manage services. Conversely, information such
     as websites visited, content viewed, mobile commerce transactions
     completed, advertisements visited, GPS location history and other service
     usage history the service monitor is capable of recording may be
     sensitive or private for some users and would thereby benefit from the
     various embodiments that provide enhanced user control of the reporting
     of such potentially sensitive or private data. It should also be
     appreciated that there is an inherent advantage to implementing traffic
     monitoring, traffic, service monitoring or service control on a device,
     because it is not necessary to report sensitive information to the
     network to accomplish many of these service policy implementation
     objectives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0220] In some embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696 assists in
     virtual application tagging of traffic flows through the networking stack
     policy implementation by tracking the virtually tagged packets through
     the stack processing and communicating the flow tags to the service
     policy implementation agent(s) 1690. In some embodiments, the service
     monitor agent 1696 maintains a history and provides reports or summary
     reports of which networks in addition to the networks controlled by the
     service controller 122 to which the device has connected. In some
     embodiments, this network activity summary includes a summary of the
     networks accessed, activity versus time per connection, and/or traffic
     versus time per connection. In some embodiments, the traffic reports that
     go to the network, possibly to service controller 122, billing system
     1619 and/or device service history 1618, are first filtered according to
     rules defined by user preference selection at the time of service
     activation (e.g., service plan/service plan option selection), time of
     first device use, at a time the user selected the option on the service
     UI or at a time the user chose to change the option on the service UI or
     some other time/mechanism allowing for user preference selection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0221] In some embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696 monitors
     application usage (e.g., which application the user executes on the
     device 100, such as e-mail applications, web browsing applications and/or
     media content streaming applications). In some embodiments, the service
     monitor agent 1696 monitors multimedia file usage (e.g., based on
     multimedia file type and/or based on specific multimedia files, such as
     specific movies and/or songs). In some embodiments, the service monitor
     agent 1696 monitors the device user interface, application, and content
     discovery history (e.g., monitoring which applications/content the user
     accesses from the device, including monitoring the pattern by which the
     user accesses such applications/content, such as how the user navigates
     the user interface on the device to access such applications/content and
     maintaining such patterns and history, such as which icons the user
     access on a home page, secondary or other portion/mechanism on the device
     for accessing various applications/content). In some embodiments, the
     service monitor agent 1696 monitors advertisements provided to the user
     on the device 100. In some embodiments, the service monitor agent 1696
     monitors advertisements viewed (e.g., accessed, such as by clicking on a
     web advertisement) by the user on the device 100. In some embodiments,
     the service monitor agent 1696 monitors GPS/location information for the
     device 100. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art,
     the service monitor agent 1696 can monitor a wide variety of activities
     performed by the device/user of the device and/or based on other
     information related to the device 100 such as GPS/location information.
     As described herein, in some embodiments, the user of the device 100 can
     also specify which activities that the user authorizes for such
     monitoring (e.g., the user may prefer to not allow for such GPS/location
     monitoring).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0222] In some embodiments, the application interface agent 1693 provides
     an interface for device application programs. In some embodiments, the
     application interface agent 1693 identifies application level traffic,
     reports virtual service identification tags or appends literal service
     identification tags to assist service policy implementation, such as
     access control, traffic shaping QoS control, service type dependent
     billing or other service control or implementation functions. In some
     embodiments, the application interface agent 1693 assists with
     application layer service usage monitoring by, for example, passively
     inspecting and logging traffic or service characteristics at a point in
     the software stack between the applications and the standard networking
     stack application interface, such as the sockets API. In some
     embodiments, the application interface agent 1693 intercepts traffic
     between the applications and the standard network stack interface API in
     order to more deeply inspect the traffic, modify the traffic or shape the
     traffic (e.g., thereby not requiring any modification of the device
     networking/communication stack of the device OS). In some embodiments,
     the application interface agent 1693 implements certain aspects of
     service policies, such as application level access control, application
     associated billing, application layer service monitoring or reporting,
     application layer based traffic shaping, service type dependent billing,
     or other service control or implementation functions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0223] In some embodiments, application layer based traffic monitoring and
     shaping can be performed as described below. The traffic from each
     application can be divided into one or more traffic flows that each flow
     through a traffic queue, with each queue being associated with one or
     more additional classifications for that application (e.g., the
     application can be a browser that is associated with multiple queues
     representing different destinations or groups of destinations it is
     connected to, with each destination or group of destinations having
     potentially different access control or traffic control policies, or the
     application can be associated with different content types or groups of
     content types with each content type having different queues, the
     application might be an email program with email text traffic going to
     one queue and downloads going to another with different policies for
     each). In some embodiments, queues are formed for all applications or
     groups of applications that are associated with one or more traffic
     parameters such as destination, content type, time of day or groups of
     applications can be similarly assigned to different queues. The functions
     performed by the application layer queues can be similar to the functions
     described for the policy implementation agent, such as pass, block,
     buffer, delay, burst in order to control the traffic or network access
     associated with the queue. The drop function can also be implemented,
     such as for application layer protocols that include reliable
     transmission methods, but if the application layer protocol does not
     involve reliable retransmission of lost information this can result in
     lost data or unreliable communication which may be acceptable in some
     cases. The manner in which the queues are controlled can be constructed
     to result in a similar approach for controlling services or implementing
     service activity control similar to the other embodiments described
     herein, including, for example, the policy control agent 1692
     implementing an higher layer of service control to achieve a higher level
     objective as discussed herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0224] In some embodiments, the application interface agent 1693 interacts
     with application programs to arrange application settings to aid in
     implementing application level service policy implementation or billing,
     such as email file transfer options, peer to peer networking file
     transfer options, media content resolution or compression settings and/or
     inserting or modifying browser headers. In some embodiments, the
     application interface agent 1693 intercepts certain application traffic
     to modify traffic application layer parameters, such as email file
     transfer options or browser headers. In some embodiments, the application
     interface agent 1693 transmits or receives a service usage test element
     to aid in verifying service policy implementation, service monitoring or
     service billing. In some embodiments, the application interface agent
     1693 performs a transaction billing intercept function to aid the billing
     agent 1695 in transaction billing. In some embodiments, the application
     interface agent 1693 transmits or receives a billing test element to aid
     in verifying transaction billing or service billing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0225] In some embodiments, a modem firewall 1655 blocks or passes traffic
     based on service policies and traffic attributes. In some embodiments,
     the modem firewall 1655 assists in virtual or literal upstream traffic
     flow tagging. Although not shown in FIG. 16, in some embodiments, the
     modem firewall 1655 is located on either side of the modem bus and in
     some embodiments it is advantageous to locate it on the modem itself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0226] In some embodiments, the billing agent 1695 detects and reports
     service billing events. In some embodiments, the billing agent 1695 plays
     a key role in transaction billing. In some embodiments, the billing agent
     1695 performs one or more of the following functions: provides the user
     with service plan options, accepts service plan selections, provides
     options on service usage notification policies, accepts user preference
     specifications on service usage notification policies, provides
     notification on service usage levels, provides alerts when service usage
     threatens to go over plan limits or to generate excess cost, provides
     options on service usage control policy, accepts choices on service usage
     control policy, informs policy control agent 1692 of user preference on
     service usage control policy, provides billing transaction options and/or
     accepts billing transaction choices. In some embodiments, the billing
     agent 1695 interacts with transaction servers (e.g., open content
     transaction partner sites 134) to conduct ecommerce transactions with
     central billing 1619.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0227] In some embodiments, service processor 115 includes one or more
     service usage or service activity counters. For example, the service
     monitor agent 1696, billing agent 1695 or a combination of these agents
     and/or other agents/components of service processor 115 can include such
     a local service usage counter(s) for the device 100. In some embodiments,
     a service usage counter monitors service usage including data usage
     to/from the device 100 with the access network 1610. In some embodiments,
     the service usage counter periodically, in response to a user request, in
     response to a service processor 115 agent's request (e.g., the billing
     agent 1695, the policy control agent 1692, or another agent of service
     processor 115), in response to the service controller 122, and/or in
     response to the central billing 1619 (e.g., for billing purposes and/or
     for storing in the device service history 1618), provides a service usage
     report, including monitored service usage for the device 100. In some
     embodiments, the service usage counter periodically, or in response to a
     request, synchronizes the service usage counter on the device 100 with a
     network (and/or billing) service usage counter, such as that maintained
     potentially at central billing 1619. In some embodiments, service
     processor 115 utilizes the service usage counter to provide a service
     usage projection. In some embodiments, service processor 115 utilizes the
     service usage counter to provide a service usage cost estimate. In some
     embodiments, service usage projections from policy control agent 1692 are
     used to estimate the projected future service usage if user service usage
     behavior remains consistent. In some embodiments, service processor 115
     utilizes the service usage counter to provide a cost of service usage,
     and the service processor 115 then periodically, or in response to a
     request, synchronizes the cost of service usage with, for example, the
     central billing 1619. In some embodiments, the service processor 115
     utilizes the service usage counter to determine whether the user is
     exceeding and/or is projected to exceed their current service plan for
     data usage, and then various actions can be performed as similarly
     described herein to allow the user to modify their service plan and/or
     modify (e.g., throttle) their network data usage. In some embodiments,
     the service usage counter can support providing to the user the following
     service usage related data/reports: service usage, known usage and
     estimated usage, projected usage, present costs, projected costs, cost to
     roam, cost to roam options, and/or projected roaming costs. For example,
     including a local service data usage counter on the device 100 allows the
     service processor 115 to more accurately monitor service data usage,
     because, for example, network (and/or billing) service usage counters may
     not accurately also include, for example, control plane data traffic sent
     to/from the device 100 in their monitored service data usage count.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0228] In some embodiments, verifiable device based service billing
     solutions are provided. For example, as described herein, various device
     based service billing solutions can include a wide range of verification
     techniques to ensure that the device is properly reporting service
     billing events (e.g., to verify/ensure that the service billing is not
     malfunctioning and/or has not been tampered with/compromised such that it
     is not accurately or timely providing service billing information). As
     described herein, service billing generally refers the billing for one or
     more services for a device, such as device 100 (e.g., email service
     billing for data usage associated with received/sent email related data
     over the access network 1610, web browsing service billing for data usage
     associated with received/sent web browsing related data over the access
     network 1610 and/or any other network based service, and/or any
     transactional based services, such as for multimedia content purchases or
     other transactions).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0229] In some embodiments, verifiable device based service billing is
     provided by sending dummy(/test) billing events, such as having an access
     control integrity server 1654 of the service controller 122 instruct the
     access control integrity agent 1694 to send a dummy(/test) billing event
     to the billing agent 1695. If the billing agent does not then send the
     expected report, which should reflect the dummy(/test) (or fails to
     timely send any report), then the system can verify whether the billing
     process is working properly. In addition, a dummy (/test) transaction can
     be used to verify transaction based billing through a variety of
     approaches (e.g., the access control integrity agent 1694 can similarly
     send a dummy(/test) transactional billing event to the billing agent 1695
     as a test to determine whether the billing agent 1695 then provides the
     expected report reflecting that dummy(/test) transaction). For example,
     the test billing events can be trapped by a device assisted billing
     mediation server and removed from the user account billing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0230] In some embodiments, verifiable device based service billing is
     provided by sending one or more data bursts to the device to confirm that
     data was received and to confirm that the service monitor agent 1696
     properly logged the data burst(s) in the local service usage or service
     activity counter. In some embodiments, data bursts can be used to verify
     data throttling (e.g., if the device has exceeded service data usage
     limits and/or is approaching such limits such that service data usage
     should be throttled, then sending data bursts can be used to verify
     whether the expected throttling is properly being performed on the
     device). In some embodiments, verifiable device based service billing is
     provided by submitting requests to connect to an unauthorized
     service/website to verify if that unauthorized service usage is properly
     blocked. In some embodiments, verifiable device based service billing is
     provided by submitting requests to perform an unauthorized transaction to
     verify if that unauthorized transaction is properly blocked.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0231] In some embodiments, verifiable device based service billing is
     provided by verifying device service activities relative to IPDRs for the
     device. In some embodiments, the IPDRs for the device (possibly in a
     modified format) are periodically and/or upon request sent to the device,
     as described herein. For example, IPDRs for the device can be compared to
     the device's local service data usage counter and/or to the service plan
     for the device to determine if the overall service data usage limit has
     been exceeded, whether out of plan/unauthorized/unrecorded websites/other
     services have been performed by the device, whether service plan/profile
     bandwidth limits have been exceeded, whether out of
     plan/unauthorized/unrecorded transactions have been performed (e.g.,
     verifying IPDR transaction logs, assuming such are included in the IPDRs,
     with the local transaction logs of the device to determine, for example,
     whether the local device records indicate that fewer than the network
     recorded number of content downloads, such as downloaded songs, were
     purchased), and/or whether any other activities verifiable based on a
     comparison of IPDRs indicate that the device has been used in any manner
     that is out of or exceeds the service plan/profile for the device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0232] In some embodiments, device based service billing includes
     recording billing option response history. For example, this approach can
     be particularly important for service plan overage conditions (e.g., when
     the use of the device is exceeding the service plan associated with the
     device in some manner, such as service data usage, bandwidth, service or
     transaction access and/or in some other manner). In some embodiments, in
     a service plan overage condition, the user is requested to confirm that
     user has acknowledged notification of service plan overage, such as via
     the user interface 1697. In some embodiments, such service plan overage
     acknowledgements require that the user enter a unique identification to
     validate authorization by the user identity associated with the device
     (e.g., another type of verification mechanism, in the event a device is
     stolen or being used by someone other than the authorized user of the
     device, then that unauthorized user would not be able to confirm the
     service plan overage acknowledgement, and appropriate actions can then be
     taken, such as throttling, quarantining or (temporarily) suspending
     service/network access). In some embodiments, if the device is
     compromised/hacked (e.g., by the user of the device), and the device is
     used in a manner that results in a service usage overage (e.g.,
     determined based on device assisted service usage monitoring, and/or
     network based service usage monitoring using IPDRs/CDRs), then the
     billing system determines billing for such service usage overage costs.
     This overage billing can be initiated by the device 100 (e.g., service
     processor 115), the service controller 122, the billing system 123, the
     AAA 121, or some other network function. In some embodiments, if the
     device is compromised/hacked (e.g., by a user of the device), and the
     device is used in a manner that results in a service usage overage, one
     or more of the following actions is taken: the user is notified, the user
     is required to acknowledge the notification, the device traffic is sent
     to SPAN (or similar traffic sampling and analysis function), and/or the
     device is flagged for further analysis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0233] In some embodiments, device based service billing includes an
     option to bill by account, such as to bill different service activities
     and/or transactions to a specified account (e.g., other than the user's
     account associated with the general service plan for the device). For
     example, bill by account can provide for billing according to
     application, content type, website, transaction, network chatter (e.g.,
     heartbeat communications and/or other network traffic that is used by,
     for example, the central/service provider to generally maintain network
     access for the device), and/or transaction partner sponsored activities
     and then report such bill by account information for billing
     mediation/reconciliation. For example, a bill by account report can be
     sent by billing agent 1695 from the device to central billing 1619 (e.g.,
     as a billing event); or alternatively, sent to an intermediate
     server/aggregator, which can then reformat and send the reformatted
     report to central billing 1619 (e.g., providing the billing report in a
     format required by central billing 1619); or alternatively, sent to a
     mediation server, which can re-compute the billing based on the bill by
     account report (e.g., offset the bill based on network chatter,
     transaction based billing, transaction partner sponsored activities,
     content providers, website providers and/or advertising providers) and
     then send the recomputed (and potentially reformatted) report to central
     billing 1619.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0234] In some embodiments, one or more of the mediation/reconciliation
     functions for device assisted billing, device generated billing events,
     device generated bill by account events and device generated open
     transaction billing events can be implemented in the service controller
     122 (e.g., the billing event server 1662) or in another function located
     in the billing system 123 or elsewhere. This billing mediation server
     function accepts the device based billing events discussed immediately
     above, reformats the billing events into a format accepted and recognized
     by the billing system, mediates the billing event information to remove
     service usage billing from the user account and place it in other bill by
     account categories as appropriate according to the bill by account
     mediation rules, adds other billing events for service usage or
     transactions to the user account as appropriate according to the device
     based billing rules, and then applies the information to the billing
     information the user account to correct or update the account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0235] For example, a bill by account can allow for a website provider,
     such as
   <b>
    <i>
     Google
    </i>
   </b>
   or Yahoo, to pay for or offset certain account usage for
     web browsing, web based searching, web based email, or any other web
     based or other service usage activities, which may also be based (in
     whole or in part) on the activities performed by the user on such
     transactional services (e.g., based on advertisement viewing/accessing or
     click-through activities by the user, by which an advertisement business
     model used by such website providers directly or indirectly supports such
     service account subsidies). As another example, a bill by account can
     allow for an advertiser to pay for or offset certain account usage for
     viewing and/or accessing (e.g., clicking through) a web placed
     advertisement or other advertisement sent via the network to the device.
     As yet another example, various network chatter (e.g., heartbeat related
     network and other network chatter related service data usage) can be
     assigned to a dummy account and such can be used to offset the bill
     and/or used for tracking the data usage for such activities for the
     device. In another example, service data usage for access to a
     transactional service, such as a multimedia content download service
     (e.g., music, eBook, music/video streaming, and/or movie or other
     multimedia content download service), or an online shopping site (e.g.,
     Amazon, eBay or another online shopping site), can be billed to a
     transactional service account assigned to a transactional service partner
     that sponsors access to that sponsor's transactional service, thereby
     allowing that transactional service partner to pays for or offset (e.g.,
     subsidize) the account usage for such activities, which may also be based
     (in whole or in part) on the transactions actually performed by the user
     on such transactional services (e.g., based on the volume/cost of the
     multimedia service download purchases by the user and/or online
     activities).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0236] In some embodiments, device based service billing includes
     recording billing events on the device and then reporting such billing to
     the network (e.g., central billing 1619). In some embodiments, device
     based service billing includes reporting service usage events and/or
     applying cost look-up and logging/reporting service billing updates. For
     example, this allows for reporting not only service usage but also cost
     of such service usage to the user via the user interface of device 100.
     Also, for example, the cost of such service usage can also be reported to
     the billing server. In some embodiments, device based service billing
     includes reporting service usage to the network, and the network
     determines the cost for such service usage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0237] In some embodiments, billing information for roaming partners is
     provided. For example, a roaming server can include a roaming service
     cost data table for roaming service partners. In this example, when the
     device (e.g., device 100) connects to a roaming network provided by a
     roaming service partner, then the device can also receive the roaming
     service data rate based on the roaming service cost data table provided
     by the roaming server. Alternatively, the roaming server can send the
     roaming service cost data table (or a modified format of the same) to the
     device thereby allowing the device to determine the costs for such
     roaming network service usage or service activity. As described herein,
     the device can also automatically use a roaming service profile when
     connecting to the roaming network service and/or the user can be notified
     of the roaming service profile options based on the roaming service data
     costs and then select the desired roaming service profile accordingly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0238] In some embodiments, the user is provided with a list of service
     costs based on locally stored roaming table and a search of available
     roaming partners that the device 100 detects and can connect to. In some
     embodiments, the user is provided with a projected cost per day for one
     or more roaming service provider options based on typical service usage
     history and the cost for each service provider. In some embodiments, the
     user is provided with a set of options for service usage notification,
     controlling or throttling service usage and/or cost while roaming (e.g.,
     using the service notification and cost control techniques as similarly
     discussed herein but applied to the roaming network). In some
     embodiments, these controls are set by a VSP (or, e.g., an IT manager
     using VSP functions). In some embodiments, roaming tables are updated
     periodically in the background while on a home network (or other low cost
     network) and cached. In some embodiments, cache updates occur based on
     fixed time period (e.g., late at night when updates are less expensive
     due to network inactivity). In some embodiments, the roaming partner cost
     table cache updates are done whenever connected to a desirable network
     that is not as expensive or bandwidth constrained (e.g., at home, work,
     or off the WWAN). In some embodiments, updates occur at time of day that
     network is not busy. In some embodiments, updates occur based on network
     push when roaming table is changed (e.g., one or more of the roaming
     partners changes the rate). In some embodiments, the service cost to
     update the roaming service cost table is charged to bill by account and
     possibly not charged to end user. In some embodiments, the roaming
     service center is provided as a service that is paid for (e.g.,
     potentially bill by account tracks all related costs). For example, this
     type of roaming cost control can be provided as a service through central
     provider, MVNO, roaming partner provider, VSP or as a third party
     application not associated with any service provider (e.g., IT manager).
     For example, the controls for how to update cache, set service control
     policies, and other controls can be defined by any number of VSP entities
     including the user through a website service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0239] In some embodiments, a roaming service center is provided as a
     service in which, for example, the user is provided with a list of
     service costs based on a locally stored (or remotely accessed) roaming
     table. In some embodiments, the roaming service center provides the user
     with a projected cost per day for one or more roaming service provider
     options based on typical service usage history and the cost for each
     service provider. In some embodiments, the roaming service center
     provides the user with a set of options for controlling/throttling usage
     and/or cost while roaming. In some embodiments, these controls are set by
     a VSP (e.g., an IT manager using VSP functions). For example, roaming
     tables can be updated periodically in the background while on a home
     network and cached. In some embodiments, cache updates occur based on a
     fixed time period. In some embodiments, the roaming partner cost table
     cache updates are done whenever the device is connected to a desirable
     network that is not as expensive or bandwidth constrained (e.g., at home,
     work and/or off the WWAN). In some embodiments, updates occur at time of
     day that network is not busy. In some embodiments, updates occur based on
     a network push when a roaming table is changed (e.g., one or more of the
     roaming partners changes the rate). In some embodiments, the service cost
     to update the roaming service cost table is charged to bill by account
     and possibly not charged to the user. In some embodiments, the roaming
     service center is provided as a service that is paid for by the user
     and/or part of a service plan. In some embodiments, a bill by account
     function tracks all related costs. For example, the roaming service
     center can be provided as a service through central provider, MVNO,
     roaming partner provider, VSP or as a third party application not
     associated with any service provider (e.g., IT manager).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0240] In some embodiments, a synchronized local service usage counter
     based on time stamped central billing information is provided. For
     example, the local service usage counter, as similarly described above,
     can also be synchronized to past service usage records (e.g., time
     stamped central billing records of service usage for the device) and use
     local estimates for current/present service usage estimates for the
     device. In this example, the central billing system (e.g., central
     billing 1619) can push the time stamped central billing information to
     the device (e.g., device 100), the device can pull the time stamped
     central billing information, and/or an intermediate server can provide a
     mediated push or pull process. In some embodiments, synchronization is
     performing periodically based on service usage levels with free-running
     estimates between synchronizations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0241] In some embodiments, service usage is projected based on calculated
     estimates of service usage based on synchronized service usage and local
     service usage count information. For example, projected service usage can
     be calculated on the device or calculated on a server (e.g., a billing
     server or an intermediate billing server), which provides the calculated
     projected service usage information to the device, such as using various
     adaptive algorithms for service usage projections. For example, an
     adaptive algorithm can use historical/past synchronized network service
     usage information (e.g., synchronized with local service usage data based
     on time stamps associated with IPDRs) to assist in service usage
     projections, based on, for example, total service usage count, service
     usage count by certain service related criteria (e.g., application,
     content, service type, website and/or time of day). In another example,
     an adaptive algorithm synchronizes to past service usage data (e.g., the
     local estimate of past service usage data is updated to be synchronized
     up through the point in time associated with the latest IPDR time stamp
     that has been received) and current local estimates of service usage
     collected since the latest time stamp are then added to the time stamped
     IPDR service usage counter to minimize the service usage counter offset
     so that it is no greater than the difference between the network service
     usage measure and the local service usage measure since the latest IPDR
     time stamp. In some embodiments, these adaptive algorithm techniques are
     performed on the device and/or performed on the network (e.g., on a
     network server) for processing. In some embodiments, if there is an
     offset in the local device based service usage count between IPDR
     synchronization events and the IPDR service usage count between IPDR
     synchronization events, then an algorithm can be employed to estimate any
     systematic sources for the offset and correct the local service usage
     count to minimize the offsets. As an example, if the IPDR service usage
     count is typically off by a fixed percentage, either high or low, then an
     algorithm can be employed to estimate a multiplier that is applied to the
     local service usage count to minimize the offset between IPDR service
     usage synchronization events. In another example, there can be a
     consistent constant offset and a multiplier offset, both of which can be
     estimated and corrected for. Those of ordinary skill in the art will
     appreciate that more sophisticated algorithms can be employed to estimate
     the nature of any systematic offsets, including, for example, offsets
     that occur due to specific service usage activities or network chatter to
     manage the device, and such offsets can then be minimized between IPDR
     service synchronization events. In some embodiments, synchronized service
     usage data is used to create an improved analysis of the statistical
     patterns of service usage to provide more accurate service usage
     projections. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that
     a variety of additional adaptive algorithm techniques can be used
     including those that provide for various statistical analysis techniques
     and/or other techniques.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0242] In some embodiments, service usage is projected for the end of a
     billing/service period for a service plan versus the service usage
     allowed under the service plan for that billing/service period. A display
     of excess charges is also provided for the projected rate of service
     usage based on the monitored service usage behavior through the end of
     the billing/service period (e.g., this can be zero if the service usage
     is projected to be less than that allowed under the service plan and a
     positive cost number if it is projected to be more than the service
     plan). For example, this can be implemented in numerous ways, such as on
     a server in the network, on a gateway/router/switch in the network,
     and/or on the device, as discussed below and generally described herein
     with respect to other service/cost usage monitoring and notification
     embodiments. If implemented in the network server or
     gateway/router/switch, then the service/cost usage projections and
     related information can be pushed to the device, or the device can be
     notified that such information is available to pull and/or periodically
     pushed/pulled. The service usage information/estimates can be collected
     from the device, the network or both (e.g., reconciled and/or
     synchronized) as similarly described herein. The service usage
     information/estimates are then analyzed to determine service usage/cost
     projects as similarly described herein and compared to the service plan
     for the device to determine the projected service/cost usage overage (if
     any). In some embodiments, one or more of the following are determined
     by, reported to and/or displayed on the device: service usage value,
     projected service usage value, service usage plan limit, projected
     service usage overage, projected service cost overage, service plan
     period time duration, service plan time remaining before end of period
     and/or other pertinent information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0243] In some embodiments, the device also determines service costs based
     on the synchronized service usage count thereby allowing the device to
     also report the service cost information to the user. For example, the
     device can locally store a service cost look-up table(s), locally store
     different service cost look-up tables for different networks and/or for
     roaming networks, and/or request such information from a billing or
     intermediate billing server (and/or a roaming server) on the network. As
     another example, the device can obtain the calculated service costs based
     on the synchronized local service usage count and/or network service
     usage count from an intermediate server (e.g., a billing or intermediate
     billing server) thereby offloading the computational costs associated
     with calculated these projections and the data storage for service cost
     lookup tables onto the intermediate server on the network using the
     network service usage counter with or, alternatively, without the
     synchronized local service usage counter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0244] In some embodiments, service usage count categorization by network
     (e.g., a home network (such as a Wi-Fi, WAN, femtocell or other home
     network) versus a roaming network) is provided. Similarly, the
     synchronized local service usage counter can be synchronized by network.
     Also, a synchronized local service usage count for networks controlled by
     a central provider, for networks controlled by other providers (e.g.,
     MVNO), and/or free networks can similarly be provided.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0245] In some embodiments, a service notification and billing interface
     is provided. For example, service usage and projected service usage, such
     as described herein, can be displayed to the user of the device (e.g.,
     via user interface 1697). Similarly, expected/projected service or cost
     overrun/overage, such as described herein, can also be displayed to the
     user. As another example, a most cost effective plan can be
     determined/projected based on historical and/or projected service usage,
     and this determined/projected most cost effective plan can be displayed
     to the user. In yet another example, a list of available networks
     accessible by the device can be displayed to the user. In this example,
     one or more undesired available networks can also be blocked from display
     thereby only displaying to the user desired and/or preferred available
     networks. In this example, service usage plans and/or service usage plan
     option comparison for one or more alternative networks or roaming
     networks can also be displayed to the user. Similarly, service cost plans
     and/or service/cost plan option comparison for one or more alternative
     networks or roaming networks can also be displayed to the user. In
     addition, roaming service usage, projected roaming service usage,
     estimated roaming service cost, and/or projected estimated roaming
     service cost can also be displayed to the user. These roaming service
     usage/costs can also be displayed to the user so that the user can
     utilize this information for selecting various roaming service billing
     options. In another example, alternative and/or least cost networks are
     determined and displayed to the user. In another example, alternative
     warnings are displayed to the user for any or specified roaming networks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0246] In some embodiments, the service notification and billing interface
     notifies the user of expected network coverage (e.g., based on the
     device's current geography/location and the accessible networks for the
     device from that current geography/location) and displays options to the
     user based on the expected network coverage information. In some
     embodiments, the service notification and billing interface notifies the
     user of their current service usage at specified service usage points and
     displays various options to the user (e.g., service usage options and/or
     billing options). For example, the user's responses to the presented
     options are recorded (e.g., stored locally on the device at least
     temporarily for reporting purposes or permanently in a local
     configuration data store until such configuration settings are otherwise
     modified or reset) and reported, such as to the billing server (e.g.,
     central billing 1619). For example, user input, such as selected options
     and/or corresponding policy settings, can be stored locally on the device
     via a cache system. As another example, the service notification and
     billing interface displays options to the user for how the user wants to
     be notified and how the user wants to control service usage costs, the
     user's input on such notification options is recorded, and the cost
     control options (e.g., and the billing agent 1695 and policy control
     agent 1692) are configured accordingly. Similarly, the user's input on
     service plan options/changes can be recorded, and the service plan
     options/changes (e.g., and the billing agent 1695 and policy control
     agent 1692) are configured/updated accordingly. In another example, the
     service notification and billing interface provides various traffic
     control profiles, such as for where the user requests assistance in
     controlling service usage costs (e.g., service data usage and/or
     transactional usage related activities/costs). Similarly, the service
     notification and billing interface can provide various notification
     options, such as for where the user wants advance warning on service
     coverage. In another example, the service notification and billing
     interface provides options for automatic pre-buy at a set point in
     service usage. In another example, the service notification and billing
     interface provides the option to choose different notification and cost
     control options for alternative networks or roaming networks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0247] In some embodiments, an online portal or web server is provided for
     allowing the user to select and/or update policy settings. For example,
     user input provided via the online portal/web server can be recorded and
     reported to the billing server (e.g., central billing 1619). In another
     example, the online portal/web server can display transaction billing
     information and/or accept input for a transaction billing request, which
     can then be reported to the billing server accordingly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0248] As shown in FIG. 16, the service processor 115 includes a service
     interface or user interface 1697. In some embodiments, the user interface
     1697 provides the user with information and accepts user choices or
     preferences on one or more of the following: user service information,
     user billing information, service activation, service plan selection or
     change, service usage or service activity counters, remaining service
     status, service usage projections, service usage overage possibility
     warnings, service cost status, service cost projections, service usage
     control policy options, privacy/CRM/GPS related options, and/or other
     service related information, settings, and/or options. For example, the
     user interface 1697 can collect service usage information from service
     monitor agent 1696 to update the local service usage counter (and/or,
     alternatively, the service usage information is obtained from the service
     controller 122) to update user interface service usage or service cost
     information for display to the user. As another example, service billing
     records obtained from central billing system 1619 can be used to
     synchronize local service usage counters and service monitor agent 1696
     information to perform real-time updating of local service usage counters
     between billing system 1619 synchronizations. As another example, the
     user interface 1697 can display options and accept user preference
     feedback, such as similarly discussed above with respect to user
     privacy/CRM/GPS filtering, traffic monitoring and service controls. For
     example, the user interface 1697 can allow the user of the device to
     modify their privacy settings, provide user feedback on service
     preferences and/or service experiences, modify their service profiles
     (e.g., preferences, settings, configurations, and/or network settings and
     options), to review service usage data (e.g., based on local service
     usage counters and/or other data monitored by the service processor 115),
     to receive various events or triggers (e.g., based on projected service
     usage/costs), and/or the user interface 1697 can provide/support various
     other user input/output for service control and service usage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0249] In some embodiments, by providing the service policy implementation
     and the control of service policy implementation to the preferences of
     the user, and/or by providing the user with the option of specifying or
     influencing how the various service notification and control policies or
     control algorithms are implemented, the user is provided with options for
     how to control the service experience, the service cost, the capabilities
     of the service, the manner in which the user is notified regarding
     service usage or service cost, the level of sensitive user information
     that is shared with the network or service provider entity, and the
     manner in which certain service usage activities may or may not be
     throttled, accelerated, blocked, enabled and/or otherwise controlled.
     Accordingly, some embodiments provide the service control to beneficially
     optimize user cost versus service capabilities or capacities in a manner
     that facilitates an optimized user experience and does not violate
     network neutrality goals, regulations and/or requirements. For example,
     by offering the user with a set of choices, ranging from simple choices
     between two or more pre-packaged service control settings options to
     advanced user screens where more detailed level of user specification and
     control is made available, some embodiments allow the service provider,
     device manufacturer, device distributor, MVNO, VSP, service provider
     partner, and/or other "entity" to implement valuable or necessary service
     controls while allowing the user to decide or influence the decision on
     which service usage activities are controlled, such as how they are
     controlled or throttled and which service usage activities may not be
     throttled or controlled in some manner. These various embodiments allow
     the service provider, device manufacturer, device distributor, MVNO, VSP,
     service provider partner, or other "entity" to assist the user in
     managing services in a manner that is network neutral with respect to
     their implementation and service control policies, because the user is
     making or influencing the decisions, for example, on cost versus service
     capabilities or quality. By further providing user control or influence
     on the filtering settings for the service usage reporting or CRM
     reporting, various levels of service usage and other user information
     associated with device usage can be transmitted to the network, service
     provider, device manufacturer, device distributor, MVNO, VSP, service
     provider partner, and/or other "entity" in a manner specified or
     influenced by the user to maintain the user's desired level of
     information privacy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0250] As shown in FIG. 16, the service processor 115 includes the service
     downloader 1663. In some embodiments, the service downloader 1663
     provides a download function to install or update service software
     elements on the device. In some embodiments, the service downloader 1663
     requires a secure signed version of software before a download is
     accepted. For example, the download can require a unique key for a
     particular service downloader 1663. As another example, the service
     downloader 1663 can be stored or execute in secure memory or execute a
     secure memory partition in the CPU memory space. Those of ordinary skill
     in the art will appreciate that there are a variety of other security
     techniques that can be used to ensure the integrity of the service
     downloader 1663.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0251] As shown in FIG. 16, the service processor 115 includes a modem
     driver 1640. In some embodiments, the modem driver 1640 converts data
     traffic into modem bus (not shown) traffic for one or more modems via the
     modem firewall 1655. As shown in FIG. 18, in some embodiments, modem
     selection and control 1811 selects the access network connection and is
     in communication with the modem firewall 1655, and modem drivers 1831,
     1815, 1814, 1813, 1812 convert data traffic into modem bus traffic for
     one or more modems and are in communication with the modem selection and
     control 1811. As shown in FIG. 21, in some embodiments, modems 2141,
     2125, 2124, 2123, 2122, which are in communication with the modem bus
     2120, connect the device to one or more networks. In some embodiments,
     different profiles are selected based on the selected network connection
     (e.g., different service profiles/policies for WWAN, WLAN, WPAN, Ethernet
     and/or DSL network connections), which is also referred to herein as
     multimode profile setting. For example, service profile settings can be
     based on the actual access network (e.g., home DSL/cable or work network)
     behind the Wi-Fi not the fact that it is Wi-Fi (or any other network,
     such as DSL/cable, satellite, or T-1), which is viewed as different than
     accessing a Wi-Fi network at the coffee shop. For example, in a Wi-Fi
     hotspot situation in which there are a significant number of users on a
     DSL or T-1 backhaul, the service controller can sit in a service provider
     cloud or an MVNO cloud, the service controls can be provided by a VSP
     capability offered by the service provider (e.g., as described herein
     with respect to FIG. 49) or the service controller can be owned by the
     hotspot service provider that uses the service controller on their own
     without any association with an access network service provider. For
     example, the service processors can be controlled by the service
     controller to divide up the available bandwidth at the hotspot according
     to QoS or user sharing rules (e.g., with some users having higher
     differentiated priority (potentially for higher service payments) than
     other users). As another example, ambient services (as similarly
     described herein) can be provided for the hotspot for verified service
     processors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0252] In some embodiments, the service processor 115 and service
     controller 122 are capable of assigning multiple service profiles
     associated with multiple service plans that the user chooses individually
     or in combination as a package. For example, a device 100 starts with
     ambient services that include free transaction services wherein the user
     pays for transactions or events rather than the basic service (e.g., a
     news service, eReader, PND service, pay as you go session Internet) in
     which each service is supported with a bill by account capability to
     correctly account for any subsidized partner billing to provide the
     transaction services (e.g., Barnes and Noble may pay for the eReader
     service and offer a revenue share to the service provider for any book or
     magazine transactions purchased form the device 100). In some
     embodiments, the bill by account service can also track the transactions
     and, in some embodiments, advertisements for the purpose of revenue
     sharing, all using the service monitoring capabilities disclosed herein.
     After initiating services with the free ambient service discussed above,
     the user may later choose a post-pay monthly Internet, email and SMS
     service. In this case, the service controller 122 would obtain from the
     billing system 123 in the case of network based billing (or in some
     embodiments the service controller 122 billing event server 1622 in the
     case of device based billing) the billing plan code for the new Internet,
     email and SMS service. In some embodiments, this code is cross referenced
     in a database (e.g., the policy management server 1652) to find the
     appropriate service profile for the new service in combination with the
     initial ambient service. The new superset service profile is then applied
     so that the user maintains free access to the ambient services, and the
     billing partners continue to subsidize those services, the user also gets
     access to Internet services and may choose the service control profile
     (e.g., from one of the embodiments disclosed herein). The superset
     profile is the profile that provides the combined capabilities of two or
     more service profiles when the profiles are applied to the same device
     100 service processor. In some embodiments, the device 100 (service
     processor 115) can determine the superset profile rather than the service
     controller 122 when more than one "stackable" service is selected by the
     user or otherwise applied to the device. The flexibility of the service
     processor 115 and service controller 122 embodiments described herein
     allow for a large variety of service profiles to be defined and applied
     individually or as a superset to achieve the desired device 100 service
     features.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0253] As shown in FIG. 16, the service controller 122 includes a service
     control server link 1638. In some embodiments, device based service
     control techniques involving supervision across a network (e.g., on the
     control plane) are more sophisticated, and for such it is increasingly
     important to have an efficient and flexible control plane communication
     link between the device agents (e.g., of the service processor 115) and
     the network elements (e.g., of the service controller 122) communicating
     with, controlling, monitoring, or verifying service policy. For example,
     the communication link between the service control server link 1638 of
     service controller 122 and the service control device link 1691 of the
     service processor 115 can provide an efficient and flexible control plane
     communication link, a service control link 1653 as shown in FIG. 16, and,
     in some embodiments, this control plane communication link provides for a
     secure (e.g., encrypted) communications link for providing secure,
     bidirectional communications between the service processor 115 and the
     service controller 122. In some embodiments, the service control server
     link 1638 provides the network side of a system for transmission and
     reception of service agent to/from network element functions. In some
     embodiments, the traffic efficiency of this link is enhanced by buffering
     and framing multiple agent messages in the transmissions (e.g., thereby
     reducing network chatter). In some embodiments, the traffic efficiency is
     further improved by controlling the transmission frequency and/or linking
     the transmission frequency to the rate of service usage or traffic usage.
     In some embodiments, one or more levels of security and/or encryption are
     used to secure the link against potential discovery, eavesdropping or
     compromise of communications on the link. In some embodiments, the
     service control server link 1638 also provides the communications link
     and heartbeat timing for the agent heartbeat function. As discussed
     below, various embodiments described herein for the service control
     server link 1638 provide an efficient and secure mechanism for
     transmitting and receiving service policy implementation, control,
     monitoring and verification information between the device agents (e.g.,
     service processor agents/components) and other network elements (e.g.,
     service controller agents/components).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0254] In some embodiments, the service control server link 1638 can
     employ the counterpart service control plane secure transmission methods
     discussed above with respect to the service control device link 1691. For
     example, one or more layers of security can be used to secure the
     communications link, including, for example, basic IP layer security, TCP
     layer security, service control link layer security, and/or security
     specific from service controller servers to service processor agents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0255] In some embodiments, the service control server link 1638 reduces
     network chatter by efficiently transmitting service control related
     communications over the link. For example, the service control server
     link 1638 can transmit server messages asynchronously as they arrive. As
     another example, the service control server link 1638 can perform
     collection or buffering of server messages between transmissions. As
     another example, the service control server link 1638 can determine when
     to transmit based potentially on several parameters, such as one or more
     of: periodic timer trigger, waiting until a certain amount of service
     usage or traffic usage has occurred, responding to a service agent
     message, responding to a service agent request, initiated by one or more
     servers, initiated by a verification error condition, and/or initiated by
     some other error condition. For example, once a transmission trigger has
     occurred, the service control server link 1638 can take all buffered
     agent communications and frame the communications. In addition, the
     service control server link 1638 can provide for an efficient
     communication link based on various embodiments related to the timing of
     transmissions over the service control link, as similarly discussed above
     with respect to the service control device link 1691 description. For
     example, the timing functions, such as asynchronous messages or polling
     for messages, constant frequency transmission, transmission based on how
     much service usage or data traffic usage has taken place, transmission in
     response to device side control link message, service verification error
     events, other error events, and/or other message transmission trigger
     criteria can be determined, controlled and/or initiated by either the
     device side or the network side depending on the embodiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0256] In some embodiments, the service control server link 1638 provides
     for securing, signing, encrypting and/or otherwise protecting the
     communications before sending such communications over the service
     control link 1653. For example, the service control server link 1638 can
     send to the transport layer or directly to the link layer for
     transmission. In another example, the service control server link 1638
     further secures the communications with transport layer encryption, such
     as TCP TLS or another secure transport layer protocol. As another
     example, the service control server link 1638 can encrypt at the link
     layer, such as using IPSEC, various possible VPN services, other forms of
     IP layer encryption and/or another link layer encryption technique.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0257] In some embodiments, the service control server link 1638 includes
     the agent heartbeat function in which the agents provide certain required
     reports to the service processor for the purpose of service policy
     implementation verification or for other purposes. For example, the
     heartbeat function can also be used to issue queries or challenges,
     messages, service settings, service control objectives, information
     requests or polling, error checks and/or other communications to the
     agents. As another example, agent heartbeat messages can be in the open
     or encrypted, signed and/or otherwise secured. Additional heartbeat
     function and the content of heartbeat messages can be provided as
     similarly described herein, such as described above with respect to the
     service control device link 1691 and the access control integrity agent
     1694 and other sections. In some embodiments, the service controller 122
     and/or agents of the service controller 122 are programmed to
     periodically provide reports, such as upon a heartbeat response (e.g., an
     agent can repeatedly send necessary reports each heartbeat), and
     appropriate actions can then be taken based upon such received reports.
     Accordingly, the heartbeat function provides an important and efficient
     system in various embodiments described herein for verifying the service
     policy implementation and/or protecting against compromise events. There
     are many other functions the agent heartbeat service can perform many of
     which are discussed herein, while many others will be apparent to one of
     ordinary skill in the art given the principles, design background and
     various embodiments provided herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0258] In some embodiments, the service control server link 1638 also
     provides a service control software download function for various
     embodiments, which, for example, can include a download of new service
     software elements, revisions of service software elements, and/or dynamic
     refreshes of service software elements of the service processor 115 on
     the device. In some embodiments, this function is performed by the
     service control server link 1638 transmitting the service control
     software as a single file over the service control link. For example, the
     file can have encryption or signed encryption beyond any provided by the
     communication link protocol itself for service control link 1653. In
     another example, the service control software files can be
     segmented/divided into smaller packets that are transmitted in multiple
     messages sent over the service control link 1653. In yet another example,
     the service control software files can be transmitted using other
     delivery mechanism, such as a direct TCP socket connection from a service
     download control server 1660, which can also involve secure transport and
     additional levels of encryption. In some embodiments, the service control
     server link 1638 and/or service download control server 1660 use(s) an
     agent serial number and/or a security key look up when agents are updated
     and/or when a dynamic agent download occurs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0259] As shown in FIG. 16, the service controller 122 includes an access
     control integrity server 1654. In some embodiments, the access control
     integrity server 1654 collects device information on service policy,
     service usage, agent configuration and/or agent behavior. For example,
     the access control integrity server 1654 can cross check this information
     to identify integrity breaches in the service policy implementation and
     control system. In another example, the access control integrity server
     1654 can initiate action when a service policy violation or a system
     integrity breach is suspected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0260] In some embodiments, the access control integrity server 1654
     (and/or some other agent of service controller 122) acts on access
     control integrity agent reports and error conditions. Many of the access
     control integrity agent 1654 checks can be accomplished by the server.
     For example, the access control integrity agent 1654 checks include one
     or more of the following: service usage measure against usage range
     consistent with policies (e.g., usage measure from the network and/or
     from the device); configuration of agents; operation of the agents;
     and/or dynamic agent download.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0261] In some embodiments, the access control integrity server 1654
     (and/or some other agent of service controller 122) verifies device
     service policy implementations by comparing various service usage
     measures (e.g., based on network monitored information, such as by using
     IPDRs, and/or local service usage monitoring information) against
     expected service usage behavior given the policies that are intended to
     be in place. For example, device service policy implementations can
     include measuring total data passed, data passed in a period of time, IP
     addresses, data per IP address, and/or other measures such as location,
     downloads, email accessed, URLs, and comparing such measures expected
     service usage behavior given the policies that are intended to be in
     place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0262] In some embodiments, the access control integrity server 1654
     (and/or some other agent of service controller 122) verifies device
     service policy, and the verification error conditions that can indicate a
     mismatch in service measure and service policy include one or more of the
     following: unauthorized network access (e.g., access beyond ambient
     service policy limits); unauthorized network speed (e.g., average speed
     beyond service policy limit); network data amount does not match policy
     limit (e.g., device not stop at limit without re-up/revising service
     policy); unauthorized network address; unauthorized service usage (e.g.,
     VOIP, email, and/or web browsing); unauthorized application usage (e.g.,
     email, VOIP, email, and/or web); service usage rate too high for plan,
     and policy controller not controlling/throttling it down; and/or any
     other mismatch in service measure and service policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0263] In some embodiments, the access control integrity server 1654
     (and/or some other agent of service controller 122) verifies device
     service policy based at least in part on, for example, various error
     conditions that indicate a mismatch in service measure and service
     policy. For example, various verification error conditions that can
     indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy include one or
     more of the following: mismatch in one service measure and another
     service measure; agent failure to report in; agent failure to respond to
     queries (e.g., challenge-response sequence and/or expected periodic agent
     reporting); agent failure to respond correctly to challenge/response
     sequence; agent improperly configured; agent failure in self checks;
     agent failure in cross-checks; unauthorized agent communication or
     attempted unauthorized communication; failure in service policy
     implementation test; failure in service usage reporting test; failure in
     service usage billing test; failure in transaction billing test; failure
     in download sequence; environment compromise event, such as unauthorized
     software load or execution (or attempt), unauthorized memory access (or
     attempt), unauthorized agent access (or attempt), known harmful software,
     and/or known harmful communications signature; and/or failure to respond
     to various messages, such as send message and suspend and/or send message
     and quarantine. In some embodiments, the access control integrity server
     1654 (and/or some other agent of service controller 122) verifies device
     service policy by performing automated queries and analysis, which are
     then reported (e.g., anomalous/suspicious report results can be reported
     for further analysis by a person responsible for determining whether such
     activities indicate out of policy activities or to provide information to
     the user to inform the user of such anomalous/suspicious report results
     that may indicate out of policy activities). For example, the user can
     review the report to authorize whether such activities were performed by
     the user (e.g., website access requests, specific transactions, and/or
     phone calls) and/or indicate that such activities were not authorized by
     the user (e.g., indicate a potential compromise of the device, such as by
     malware or other unauthorized software/user use of the device). In
     another example, the user can also be connected to communicate with
     service support of the service provider regarding such reported
     activities (e.g., by text/chat, voice/phone, and/or video conference to a
     service support). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the access control
     integrity server 1654 (and/or some other agent of service controller 122)
     provides a policy/service control integrity service to continually (e.g.,
     periodically and/or based on trigger events) verify that the service
     control of the device has not been compromised and/or is not behaving out
     of policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0264] In some embodiments, upon detection of one or more service
     verification errors, such as the various service verification errors
     discussed above, the device is directed to a quarantine network status in
     which the device can, for example, only access network control plane
     functions, billing functions, and other functions generally controlled by
     the access network service provider or the central service provider. For
     example, quarantine network access restrictions and routing can be
     accomplished with the access network AAA and routing system (e.g., access
     network AAA server 1621 and one or more of the gateways 410, 420, 508,
     512, 520, 608, 612, 620, 708, 712, 720) or can be accomplished with
     device based access control or traffic control policy implementation.
     Quarantine network equipment or servers can, for example, be located
     within the access network or within another network with access to the
     access network. Communication with the quarantine network infrastructure
     can be accomplished, for example, with a secure link with one or more
     encryption levels or a dedicated private link. In some embodiments,
     quarantining a device includes, for example, a two step process for
     routing quarantine network device traffic, first, to a quarantine traffic
     handling router or server and, second, from there to the actual
     quarantine network infrastructure, with the route being determined by
     device parameters, user parameters, access service provider parameters or
     other parameters associated with the quarantine network routing. In some
     embodiments, the device is completely suspended from the network in
     which, for example, the device can first issue a user interface message
     to the user or issuing another form of a message to the user or service
     subscriber, such as via email, hard copy message and/or voice message. In
     some embodiments, the device network access, service capabilities and/or
     traffic shaping are limited, partially restricted or completely
     restricted, service capabilities. For example, these limitations and/or
     restrictions can be implemented in the device and/or in the network. For
     example, implementing a device quarantine (e.g., using a RADIUS server to
     quarantine the device) can involve assigning the device to a different
     billing profile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0265] In some embodiments, upon detection of one or more service
     verification errors, such as the various service verification errors
     discussed above, switch based port analysis is performed to further
     monitor the device (e.g., referred to as Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) on
     Cisco switches, and various other vendors have different names for it,
     such as Roving Analysis Port (RAP) on 3Com switches). In some
     embodiments, the device service policy implementation behavior is
     monitored at a deeper level in the network by copying device traffic in
     the switch so that it goes to both an intended data path destination and
     to a specified port for switch based port analysis (e.g., the traffic
     content can be analyzed and recorded using deep packet inspection (DPI)
     techniques, which can provide a finer level of detail than the typical
     IPDR). For example, an advantage of performing a switch based port
     analysis function is that the traffic need not be analyzed in real time,
     and a sample subset of the devices on the network can be selected for
     such analysis based on, for example, either identifying devices that have
     suspect service policy implementation behavior and/or a regular sampling
     algorithm that eventually samples all devices, or some other selection
     approaches. As another example, a scheduled switch based port analysis
     sampling can be applied that eventually rotates through all devices and
     designates a higher priority in the sampling queue for devices that are
     suspect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0266] In some embodiments, switch based port analysis allows for off-line
     sampled or non-real-time DPI, as described above, as a verification
     measure for the device based service control measures that are
     implemented. In some embodiments, sophisticated DPI techniques are used
     to enhance the content of the IPDRs so that they provide detailed
     information that can be made available in the network. For example, some
     of the DPI packet analysis may be redundant between the device and the
     network, but this approach provides for a much finer grain validation for
     the device based service and less reliance on the device for some of the
     service traffic analysis that service providers need. In some
     embodiments, the device control server functions and the service control
     policy verification functions are implemented in an integrated
     hardware/software system (e.g., a gateway, server, router, switch, base
     station, base station aggregator, AAA server cluster or any other
     hardware or hardware/software system) located in the network that the
     network level traffic inspection is accomplished in, or in one or more
     servers integrated to operate in a coordinated manner with the DPI boxes.
     In some embodiments, the device control server functions and the service
     control policy verification functions are implemented in an integrated
     hardware/software system (e.g., a gateway, server, router, switch, base
     station, base station aggregator, AAA server cluster or any other
     hardware or hardware/software system) located in the network that
     provides deep service control capability (e.g., using DPI techniques) for
     devices that have some or all of the service processor functions
     installed and, in some embodiments, also providing coarser network
     control of the basics for devices that do not have a service processor
     installed in the device (e.g., such coarser network control functions
     include max data rate and/or max total data).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0267] In some embodiments, the SPAN function is used in a revolving
     periodic manner as well to augment CDR data with deeper packet
     information for the purpose of spot-checking device based service usage
     measures. Examples of where this can be beneficial include spot checking
     network address access policies, spot checking ambient access policies,
     spot checking billing event reports, spot checking intermediate
     networking device/end point device count (via checking network source or
     destination addresses, token, cookies or other credentials, etc). For
     example, the periodic SPAN can be scheduled for all devices equally, for
     certain devices or users with higher priority, frequency or depth of SPAN
     than others, higher priority, higher frequency or immediate priority for
     devices with higher usage patterns or unusual usage patterns, immediate
     or very high priority for devices with a policy violation status.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0268] In some embodiments, a combination traffic inspection and service
     control approach implements traffic and service control functions in the
     network that are conducive for a network based implementation and
     implements traffic and service control functions in the device that are
     either more conducive for performing in the device or can only be
     performed in the device (e.g., activities involving inspection of traffic
     that is encrypted once it is transmitted to the network). For example,
     using this approach, activities that can be done in the network are
     generally performed in the network and/or are more efficiently performed
     in the network than the device, and activities that are more efficiently
     performed in the device or can only be performed in the device are
     performed in the device (e.g., depending on device processing/storage
     capabilities and/or other design/security considerations). For example,
     the following are various traffic and service control functions that, in
     some embodiments, are preferably or can only be performed in the device:
     network based packet processing capability limitations (e.g., encrypted
     traffic, application layer information unavailable once the traffic goes
     into the networking stack, other application/usage context information
     available on the device but not in the network); information that is
     generally/preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for
     network neutrality reasons (e.g., network neutrality issues can generally
     be efficiently implemented by keeping all, substantially all or at least
     some aspect of decisions on how to implement algorithms to control
     traffic local to the device and under user decision control, and/or by
     providing the user with a set of pre-packaged choices on how to manage
     service usage or service activity usage or manage service usage versus
     service cost or price); information that is generally/preferably
     maintained and processed locally in the device for user privacy reasons
     (e.g., deeper levels of traffic monitoring and service usage monitoring
     data where it is available for assisting the user in achieving the best,
     lowest cost experience and implementing a CRM filter function to the user
     so that the user can control the level of CRM the network is allowed to
     receive, such as with the higher levels of information being exchanged
     for something of value to the user, and/or user location information);
     information that is generally/preferably maintained and processed locally
     in the device for the purpose of informing the user of service control
     settings or service activity usage or to adjust service activity control
     settings or receive user feedback to choices regarding service usage
     policies or billing options (e.g., providing the user with a UI for the
     purpose of monitoring an estimate of service usage and/or notifying the
     user of at least some aspect of estimated service usage or projected
     service usage, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring
     an estimate of service cost and/or notifying the user of at least some
     aspect of estimated service cost or projected service cost, providing the
     user with a UI for the purpose of providing the user with one or more
     service usage and/or service cost notification messages that require user
     acknowledgement and/or a user decision and obtaining or reporting the
     user acknowledgements and/or decisions, providing the user with a UI for
     the purpose of providing the user with service options and/or service
     payment options, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of
     obtaining user choice for such options when service usage or cost
     estimates are about to run over limits or have run over limits or are
     projected to run over limits, providing the user with a UI for the
     purpose of monitoring or conducting open central billing transactions or
     other transactions, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of
     selecting the service control techniques and/or policies and/or
     algorithms and/or pre-packaged configurations that can be used to define
     or partially define the service activity usage control policies
     implemented in the device service processor or the network service
     control equipment/billing system or a combination of both); service
     control for roaming on different networks that typically do not have
     compatible DPI-type techniques with the home network; certain service
     notification and traffic control algorithms (e.g., stack-ranked activity
     statistical analysis and control of only the high usage activities);
     and/or a function for assigning a device to a service experience or
     ambient activation experience or virtual service provider (VSP) at
     various times from manufacturing to device distribution to a user of the
     device. In some embodiments, certain activities are implemented in the
     device as a solution for networks in which a new centralized DPI approach
     is not possible, not economically feasible, or for any number of reasons
     not an option or not a preferred option.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0269] In some embodiments, a network based solution is provided for a
     more basic set of services for all devices that do not have service
     control capabilities, and a super-set of services and/or additional
     services are provided for devices that include a service processor. As
     described herein, a service controller function can be located in various
     places in the network in accordance with various embodiments. It should
     also be noted that various other embodiments described herein also employ
     a hybrid service control function performing certain service control
     functions in the network (e.g., collecting network service usage
     information, such as IPDRs, and/or performing DPI related functions in
     the network for collecting network service usage information and/or
     throttling/shaping traffic) and service control functions in the device
     (e.g., service processor 115, which, for example, monitors service usage
     in the device and/or performs throttling or traffic shaping in the device
     and/or performs certain billing event recording and reporting functions
     that are aptly performed on the device).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0270] In some embodiments, lower level service policy implementation
     embodiments are combined with a higher level set of service policy
     supervision functions to provide device assisted verifiable network
     access control, authentication and authorization services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0271] In some embodiments, device based access control services are
     extended and combined with other policy design techniques to create a
     simplified device activation process and connected user experience
     referred to herein as ambient activation. As similarly discussed above,
     ambient activation can be provided by setting access control to a fixed
     destination, verifying access with IPDRs, verifying access by setting a
     max data rate and triggering off in the network if it exceeds the max
     data rate, and/or by various other techniques.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0272] As shown in FIG. 16, service controller 122 includes a service
     history server 1650. In some embodiments, the service history server 1650
     collects and records service usage or service activity reports from the
     Access Network AAA Server 1621 and the Service Monitor Agent 1696. For
     example, although service usage history from the network elements can in
     certain embodiments be less detailed than service history from the
     device, the service history from the network can provide a valuable
     source for verification of device service policy implementation, because,
     for example, it is extremely difficult for a device error or compromise
     event on the device to compromise the network based equipment and
     software. For example, service history reports from the device can
     include various service tracking information, as similarly described
     above. In some embodiments, the service history server 1650 provides the
     service history on request to other servers and/or one or more agents. In
     some embodiments, the service history server 1650 provides the service
     usage history to the device service history 1618. In some embodiments,
     for purposes of facilitating the activation tracking service functions
     (described below), the service history server 1650 maintains a history of
     which networks the device has connected to. For example, this network
     activity summary can include a summary of the networks accessed, activity
     versus time per connection, and/or traffic versus time per connection. As
     another example, this activity summary can further be analyzed or
     reported to estimate the type of service plan associated with the traffic
     activity for the purpose of bill sharing reconciliation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0273] As shown in FIG. 16, service controller 122 includes a policy
     management server 1652. In some embodiments, the policy management server
     1652 transmits policies to the service processor 115 via the service
     control link 1653. In some embodiments, the policy management server 1652
     manages policy settings on the device (e.g., various policy settings as
     described herein with respect to various embodiments) in accordance with
     a device service profile. In some embodiments, the policy management
     server 1652 sets instantaneous policies on policy implementation agents
     (e.g., policy implementation agent 1690). For example, the policy
     management server 1652 can issue policy settings, monitor service usage
     and, if necessary, modify policy settings. For example, in the case of a
     user who prefers for the network to manage their service usage costs, or
     in the case of any adaptive policy management needs, the policy
     management server 1652 can maintain a relatively high frequency of
     communication with the device to collect traffic and/or service measures
     and issue new policy settings. In this example, device monitored service
     measures and any user service policy preference changes are reported,
     periodically and/or based on various triggers/events/requests, to the
     policy management server 1652. In this example, user privacy settings
     generally require secure communication with the network (e.g., a secure
     service control link 1653), such as with the policy management server
     1652, to ensure that various aspects of user privacy are properly
     maintained during such configuration requests/policy settings transmitted
     over the network. For example, information can be compartmentalized to
     service policy management and not communicated to other databases used
     for CRM for maintaining user privacy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0274] In some embodiments, the policy management server 1652 provides
     adaptive policy management on the device. For example, the policy
     management server 1652 can issue policy settings and objectives and rely
     on the device based policy management (e.g., service processor 115) for
     some or all of the policy adaptation. This approach can require less
     interaction with the device thereby reducing network chatter on service
     control link 1653 for purposes of device policy management (e.g., network
     chatter is reduced relative to various server/network based policy
     management approaches described above). This approach can also provide
     robust user privacy embodiments by allowing the user to configure the
     device policy for user privacy preferences/settings so that, for example,
     sensitive information (e.g., geo-location data, website history) is not
     communicated to the network without the user's approval. In some
     embodiments, the policy management server 1652 adjusts service policy
     based on time of day. In some embodiments, the policy management server
     1652 receives, requests or otherwise obtains a measure of network
     availability and adjusts traffic shaping policy and/or other policy
     settings based on available network capacity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0275] In some embodiments, the policy management server 1652 performs a
     service control algorithm to assist in managing overall network capacity
     or application QoS. In some embodiments, the policy management server
     1652 performs an algorithm to determine which access network is best to
     connect to, such as based on network capacity or application QoS, service
     usage costs, and/or any other criteria. In some embodiments, the device
     is capable of connecting to more than one network, and accordingly,
     device service policies can be selected/modified based on which network
     the device is connected to. In some embodiments, the network control
     plane servers detect a network connection change from a first network to
     a second network and initiate the service policy implementation
     established for the second network. In other embodiments, the device
     based adaptive policy control agent (e.g., policy control agent 1692
     described herein) detects network connection changes from the first
     network to the second network and implements the service policies
     established for the second network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0276] In some embodiments, when more than one access network is
     available, the network is chosen based on which network is most preferred
     according to a network preference list or according to the network that
     optimizes a network cost function. For example, the preference list can
     be pre-established by the service provide and/or the user. For example,
     the network cost function can be based on a minimum service cost, maximum
     network performance, determining whether or not the user or device has
     access to the network, maximizing service provider connection benefit,
     reducing connections to alternative paid service providers, and/or a
     variety of other network preference criteria. In other embodiments, the
     device detects when one or more preferred networks are not available,
     implements a network selection function or intercepts other network
     selection functions, and offers a connection to the available service
     network that is highest on a preference list. For example, the preference
     list can be set by the service provider, the user and/or the service
     subscriber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0277] As shown in FIG. 16, service controller 122 includes a network
     traffic analysis server 1656. In some embodiments, the network traffic
     analysis server 1656 collects/receives service usage history for devices
     and/or groups of devices and analyzes the service usage. In some
     embodiments, the network traffic analysis server 1656 presents service
     usage statistics in various formats to identify improvements in network
     service quality and/or service profitability. In other embodiments, the
     network traffic analysis server 1656 estimates the service quality and/or
     service usage for the network under variable settings on potential
     service policy. In other embodiments, the network traffic analysis server
     1656 identifies actual or potential service behaviors by one or more
     devices that are causing problems for overall network service quality or
     service cost.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0278] As shown in FIG. 16, service controller 122 includes a beta test
     server 1658. In some embodiments, the beta test server 1658 publishes
     candidate service plan policy settings to one or more devices. In some
     embodiments, the beta test server 1658 provides summary reports of
     network service usage or user feedback information for one or more
     candidate service plan policy settings. In some embodiments, the beta
     test server 1658 provides a mechanism to compare the beta test results
     for different candidate service plan policy settings or select the
     optimum candidates for further policy settings optimization.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0279] As shown in FIG. 16, service controller 122 includes a service
     download control server 1660. In some embodiments, the service download
     control server 1660 provides a download function to install and/or update
     service software elements (e.g., the service processor 115 and/or
     agents/components of the service processor 115) on the device, as
     described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0280] As shown in FIG. 16, service controller 122 includes a billing
     event server 1662. In some embodiments, the billing event server 1662
     collects billing events, provides service plan information to the service
     processor 115, provides service usage updates to the service processor
     115, serves as interface between device and central billing server 1619,
     and/or provides trusted third party function for certain ecommerce
     billing transactions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0281] As shown in FIG. 16, the Access Network AAA server 1621 is in
     network communication with the access network 1610. In some embodiments,
     the Access Network AAA server 1621 provides the necessary access network
     AAA services (e.g., access control and authorization functions for the
     device access layer) to allow the devices onto the central provider
     access network and the service provider network. In some embodiments,
     another layer of access control is required for the device to gain access
     to other networks, such as the Internet, a corporate network and/or a
     machine to machine network. This additional layer of access control can
     be implemented, for example, by the service processor 115 on the device.
     In some embodiments, the Access Network AAA server 1621 also provides the
     ability to suspend service for a device and resume service for a device
     based on communications received from the service controller 122. In some
     embodiments, the Access Network AAA server 1621 also provides the ability
     to direct routing for device traffic to a quarantine network or to
     restrict or limit network access when a device quarantine condition is
     invoked. In some embodiments, the Access Network AAA server 1621 also
     records and reports device network service usage (e.g., device network
     service usage can be reported to device service history 1618).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0282] As shown in FIG. 16, the device service history 1618 is in network
     communication with the access network 1610. In some embodiments, the
     device service history 1618 provides service usage data records used for
     various purposes in various embodiments. In some embodiments, the device
     service history 1618 is used to assist in verifying service policy
     implementation. In some embodiments, the device service history 1618 is
     used to verify service monitoring. In some embodiments, the device
     service history 1618 is used to verify billing records and/or billing
     policy implementation. In some embodiments, the device service history
     1618 is used to synchronize and/or verify the local service usage
     counter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0283] As shown in FIG. 16, the central provider billing server 1619 is in
     network communication with the access network 1610. In some embodiments,
     the central provider billing server 1619 provides a mediation function
     for central provider billing events. For example, the central provider
     billing server 1619 can accept service plan changes. In some embodiments,
     the central provider billing server 1619 provides updates on device
     service usage, service plan limits and/or service policies. In some
     embodiments, the central provider billing server 1619 collects billing
     events, formulates bills, bills service users, provides certain billing
     event data and service plan information to the service controller 122
     and/or device 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0284] Establishing Coordinated Service and Verification Policies for
     Service Processor, Service Controller and Network Functions
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0285] In some embodiments, device and network apparatus coordinate one or
     more of the following: network service policy implementation settings,
     device service policy implementation settings, network service profile
     implementation settings, device service profile implementation settings,
     network service usage measures used for the purpose of verifying service
     policy implementation, device service usage measures used for the purpose
     of verifying service policy implementation, network actions taken upon
     detection of service usage policy violation and device actions taken upon
     detection of service usage policy violation. In some embodiments, local
     device settings for the service monitoring, usage and/or billing profile
     or policy settings used, for example, by a device service processor 115,
     are associated with corresponding records for the various network
     apparatus that also rely upon the service policy and profile settings to
     monitor, control and/or bill for services or to respond to out of policy
     service usage conditions. For example, such network apparatus include the
     service controller 122 or similar functions, the billing system 123 or
     similar functions, the network AAA 121, gateways 410, 420, 508, 512, 520,
     608, 612, 620, 708, 712, 720, or other networking equipment. In some
     embodiments, the service profile or policy settings are associated
     between the device and network in a manner that allows for effective and
     coordinated operation between the device service processor 115 and the
     network apparatus, but does not require an explicit function that
     simultaneously controls/coordinates the service policy or profile
     implementation and/or verification actions taken by the device 100 (e.g.,
     the service processor 115) and the network apparatus. As an example, such
     embodiments can be applied in overlay applications as discussed below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0286] In some embodiments, a network function (e.g., the service
     controller 122, and/or more specifically the policy management server
     1652 function, or other similar function) obtain, derive or otherwise
     determine the association of the service profile or policy settings to
     program a device service processor 115 and the various network apparatus
     functions (e.g., possibly including but not limited to the service
     controller 122 or similar functions, the billing system 123 or similar
     functions, the network AAA 121, gateways 410, 420, 508, 512, 520, 608,
     612, 620, 708, 712, 720, or other networking equipment) by reading,
     receiving, querying, pulling or otherwise obtaining the settings from one
     or more of the network apparatus functions or from a data base that
     stores the service policy or profile settings for one or more of the
     network apparatus functions. After obtaining one or more of the network
     apparatus settings, a mapping (e.g., an association) of the network
     apparatus settings to the appropriate device 100 (service processor 115)
     settings can be determined to advantageously support the service usage
     monitoring, service usage control, service usage billing or service usage
     verification objectives being addressed. The policy or profile settings
     for the device can be a direct translation of the policy or profile
     settings used for the network apparatus, or the device policy or profile
     settings can be less directly derived from the network apparatus policy
     or profile settings. For example, service usage limits contained in the
     billing system 123 service plan can be either directly mapped to usage
     limit settings on the device service processor 115 (e.g., service usage
     stops when the limit is hit or the user is notified or the user is
     billed), or the usage limits can be mapped to a number of service
     profiles the user may select from (e.g., as discussed herein, the user
     can select from options involving various actual usage versus usage limit
     notification policies and/or service usage control, limitations or
     throttling policies).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0287] For example, the service usage policy or profile limits or
     allowances maintained for the network apparatus functions (e.g., the
     service profile or service plan usage limits stored in the billing system
     123 or AAA 121) can be read or queried by a network function (e.g., the
     service controller 122 or the service controller 122 through a second
     intermediary server connected to the billing system 123 and/or the AAA
     system 121), and the service usage limits stored in these networking
     apparatus can be either directly translated to the settings for the
     service processor 115 or may need to be interpreted, expanded or
     otherwise modified to obtain the required service processor 115 policy
     and/or profile settings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0288] In some embodiments, the service usage limits set in the billing
     system 123 service plan record, and/or the service profile record stored
     in the AAA system 121 can be acquired (e.g., from the apparatus or from a
     database storing the settings for the apparatus) by the service
     controller (or another network function) and directly translated and used
     to program the settings in the service processor 123. In some
     embodiments, the service usage limits are determined or obtained by the
     activation server apparatus embodiments, other apparatus embodiments
     associated with service activation, or the virtual service provider
     embodiments, as described herein. In this manner, once the association of
     the service usage profile or policy settings used by a device service
     processor 115 and the profile or policy settings used by the various
     network apparatus functions is established, then the service policy or
     profile for service monitoring, control, billing, verification and/or
     actions taken on verification error can be coordinated between device and
     network even if some of the network functions act independent of some of
     the device functions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0289] For example, associating the service usage policies and/or profiles
     between the device service processor 115 and the various network
     apparatus functions, and then allowing for independent operation or
     action by the various functions in a manner that results in a coordinated
     outcome, facilitates an overlay of the device assisted services
     technology onto existing network equipment in a manner that results in
     reliable and verifiable service enhancements while minimizing the need
     for major existing network equipment upgrades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0290] In some embodiments, the association of the service profile or
     policy settings used by a device service processor 115 and the service
     profile or policy settings used by the various network apparatus
     functions can be provided by a centralized network function that
     determines the appropriate settings for the network apparatus and the
     service processor 115 and sets one or more settings to each function. In
     some embodiments, this networking function is provided by a centralized
     network management function or service account activation function (e.g.,
     the activation server apparatus embodiments, one of the other disclosed
     apparatus embodiments associated with service activation or the virtual
     service provider apparatus embodiments, as described herein).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0291] In some embodiments, the association of the service profile or
     policy settings used by a device service processor 115 and the service
     profile or policy settings used by the various network apparatus
     functions can be provided by a network function that by reads, receives,
     queries, pulls or otherwise obtains the setting used by the service
     controller 122 or the service processor 115. The network function can
     then determine the association of the service profile or policy settings
     used by a device service processor 115 and the service profile or policy
     settings required by the various network apparatus functions before
     writing, transmitting, pushing, or otherwise recording the appropriate
     settings required by each of the other network apparatus functions. In
     some embodiments, this functionality can be implemented in the service
     controller (e.g., the policy management server, possibly acting in
     coordination with another network function or server), which then links
     into the databases used for storing the policy or profile settings for
     the other network apparatus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0292] In some embodiments, once the association is established between
     service policy or profile settings in the network apparatus and the
     service policy or profile settings in the service processor 115, then the
     network based service usage measures (e.g., IPDRs communicated to the
     billing system 123, the AAA 121, service controller 122 or other network
     functions used to verify service usage and/or take actions) used for
     verification of device 100 service usage versus service policy or profile
     can be monitored by the network apparatus (e.g., billing system 123 and
     AAA 121) independent of coordination with the service processor 115
     and/or independent of the service controller 122. In some embodiments, in
     addition to independent monitoring and verification of service usage
     versus policy, independent service profile or policy verification error
     response actions can be taken by the network apparatus (e.g., suspend,
     quarantine, SPAN or flag device 100, notify the user and possibly require
     acknowledgement, or bill the user account for service usage overage)
     without direct involvement by the service processor 115 and/or the
     service controller 122.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0293] Accordingly, the association between service profile and/or service
     policy that is implemented on the device 100 (e.g., service processor
     115) and the service profile and/or policy usage limits recorded in
     network apparatus can be associated with one another by one or more of
     the following: (A) implementing a function to read from the network
     database (e.g., the billing 123 data base, AAA 121 data base, service
     controller 122 data base, etc.) and mapping the network profiles and/or
     policies to device 100 (e.g., service processor 115) profiles and/or
     policies; (B) implementing a function that simultaneously sets the device
     profile and/or policy and the network equipment profile and/or policy
     recorded in the appropriate data base records; and (C) implementing a
     function that reads the profile and/or policy on the device 100 (e.g.,
     service processor 115) or the service controller 122 and then sets the
     network equipment profile and/or policy recorded in the appropriate data
     base records. This allows for a simplified but coordinated response to
     monitoring, controlling and billing for service usage, for verifying
     service usage versus service usage profile or policy, and/or initiating
     or carrying out network actions in response to service usage versus
     profile or policy verification errors and/or device actions in response
     to service usage versus profile or policy verification errors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0294] FIG. 17 is another functional diagram illustrating the device based
     service processor 115 and the service controller 122 in accordance with
     some embodiments. FIG. 17 provides for various embodiments as similarly
     described above with respect to the various embodiments described above
     with respect to FIG. 16, with one of the differences being that the
     service controller 122 as shown in FIG. 17 is connected to the access
     network and not (directly) connected to the Internet. Accordingly, as
     shown in FIG. 17, in some embodiments, the service control link 1653 is a
     communications link between the service controller 122 and the service
     processor 115 over the access network 1610.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0295] FIG. 18 is another functional diagram illustrating the device based
     service processor 115 and the service controller 122 in which the service
     processor controls the policy implementation for multiple access network
     modems and technologies in accordance with some embodiments. As shown,
     FIG. 18 provides for various embodiments as similarly described above
     with respect to the various embodiments described above with respect to
     FIG. 16, with one of the differences being that the service processor
     controls the policy implementation for multiple access network modems and
     technologies. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 18, in some embodiments, a
     connection manager 1804, which as shown is in control plane communication
     with a modem selection and control 1811, provides a control and
     supervision function for one or more modem drivers or modems that connect
     to an access network. In some embodiments, the modem selection and
     control 1811 selects the access network connection and is in
     communication with the modem firewall 1655, and modem drivers, which as
     shown include Dial/DSL modem driver 1831, Ethernet modem driver 1815,
     WPAN modem driver 1814, WLAN modem driver 1813, and WWAN modem driver
     1812, convert data traffic into modem bus traffic for one or more modems
     and are in communication with the modem selection and control 1811.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0296] FIG. 19 is another functional diagram illustrating the service
     processor 115 and the service controller 122 in accordance with some
     embodiments. As shown in FIG. 19, a stripped down (e.g., reduced set of
     agents/components/functionality) embodiment of the service processor 115
     and the service controller 122 are provided in which service policy is
     not adaptive but rather is set by the service controller 122. In this
     example, the agent within the service processor 115 that implements
     service policy is the policy implementation agent 1690. Also, in this
     example, the service controller 122 is similarly stripped down to a
     simplified configuration (e.g., reduced set of
     agents/components/functionality).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0297] Referring to FIG. 19, in some embodiments, many of the service
     policy implementation verification and compromise protection techniques
     are similarly provided using these simplified configurations of the
     service processor 115 and the service controller 122, as described above
     with respect to, for example, FIG. 16. For example, the service control
     device link 1691 and service control server link 1638 can be used for
     downloading service policies to the policy implementation agent 1690
     (but, in some embodiments, cannot perform the heartbeat or authentication
     function).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0298] For example, a basic service profile or service policy
     implementation verification technique for this reduced configuration
     calls for the access control integrity server 1654 to obtain IPDRs from
     access network AAA server 1621 (or 121) (e.g., or other network functions
     as described herein) and compare the service usage exhibited by device
     100 with a range of expected service usage that would be expected if the
     intended service policies were in place on the device. In some
     embodiments, the access control integrity server 1654 initiates or
     carries out one or more of the service usage profile or policy
     verification error response actions disclosed herein, including, for
     example, one or more of the following: notify the user of the out of
     policy or overage condition, require the user to acknowledge the
     condition and/or acknowledge a subsequent billing event to proceed, bill
     the user for service overage, suspend the device from the network,
     quarantine the device, SPAN the device, or notify a network manager or
     device management or error handling function.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0299] In some embodiments, a service profile or service policy
     implementation verification technique for this reduced configuration
     calls for the billing system 123 to obtain IPDRs from access network AAA
     server 1621 (or 121) (or other network functions as discussed herein) and
     compare the service usage exhibited by device 100 with a range of
     expected service usage that would be expected if the intended service
     policies were in place on the device. In some embodiments, the billing
     system 123 initiates or carries out one or more of the service usage
     profile or policy verification error response actions disclosed herein,
     including, for example, one or more of the following: notify the user of
     the out of policy or overage condition, require the user to acknowledge
     the condition and/or acknowledge a subsequent billing event to proceed,
     bill the user for service overage, suspend the device from the network,
     quarantine the device, SPAN the device, or notify a network manager or
     device management or error handling function.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0300] In some embodiments, a service profile or service policy
     implementation verification technique for this reduced configuration
     calls for the AAA server 1621 (or 121) itself to compare the service
     usage exhibited by device 100 with a range of expected service usage that
     would be expected if the intended service policies were in place on the
     device. In some embodiments, the AAA server 1621 (or 121) initiates or
     carries out one or more of the service usage profile or policy
     verification error response actions disclosed herein, including, for
     example, one or more of the following: notify the user of the out of
     policy or overage condition, require the user to acknowledge the
     condition and/or acknowledge a subsequent billing event to proceed, bill
     the user for service overage, suspend the device from the network,
     quarantine the device, SPAN the device, or notify a network manager or
     device management or error handling function.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0301] Accordingly, this approach provides a basic first layer of service
     policy implementation verification that does not depend on device based
     agent behavior for the verification. If the service policy is in error in
     a way that violates the expected service policy usage limits, then the
     access control integrity server 1654 will detect this condition and
     appropriate action can be taken. In some embodiments, if one or more
     service policy integrity verification tests fail, the appropriate
     responsive actions can include routing the device to quarantine status,
     sending an error message to the device or device user interface and then
     suspend access for the device, and/or limiting access in some way without
     completely suspending access, as similarly described above. In some
     embodiments, if one or more service policy integrity verification tests
     fail, the appropriate responsive actions can include logging excess
     service usage above the intended service policy limits and billing the
     user for some or all of the excess usage, sending the user a notification
     and/or acknowledgement response request (possibly including a simple
     keystroke acknowledgement, or a password, a biometric signature or other
     secure response), and/or limiting access in some way without completely
     suspending access, as similarly described above.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0302] In some embodiments, a billing system technique provides another
     verification overlay. For example, the service processor 115 can have a
     set of service policy implementations (or service profile) that calls for
     maintaining service usage within a certain limit, or assisting the user
     or network to maintain service usage to that limit. The billing system
     123 can be implemented in a way to provide a "back stop" to the service
     usage controls or limits provided for by the service processor 115, so
     that even if the service processor 115 is compromised, hacked, spoofed or
     is otherwise in error, the billing system 123 protects the service
     provider, "service owner", carrier, VSP or network operator from unpaid
     access beyond the service limits. This can be accomplished, for example,
     by assigning a service usage limit within the billing system 123 so that
     if the service processor 115 is compromised and the service usage runs
     over the desired limit, the billing system 123 automatically charges the
     user account for the overage. The billing system 123 can receive service
     usage information from the IPDRs that are aggregated in the network as in
     the case of a conventional billing system, and because these network
     based measures are independent from the device agent operation, they
     cannot be spoofed by merely spoofing something on the device or service
     processor 115. In this manner, defeating the service processor 115
     service agent control mechanisms described herein simply results in a
     billing charge and not free service. In some embodiments, if the service
     usage runs over the service usage limit specified in the service profile,
     the user can be notified as discussed herein, and the user can be
     required to acknowledge the overage and approve a billing charge for the
     overage as also discussed herein, with the acknowledgement being
     communicated back to the network in some embodiments. This positive
     acknowledgement also provides a layer of protection and verification of
     the service control and usage limit control for the device service
     processor 115. In some embodiment also discussed herein, the user is
     requested to input a password, biometric or other secure response to the
     usage overage notification, providing yet another layer of protection to
     verify that the user intends to pay for the service usage overage. In
     these embodiments taken individually or in combination, the service
     processor 115 assistance for service usage control can be verified and/or
     protected from compromise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0303] In some embodiments, the service control device link 1691 and
     service control server link 1638 are used to implement the service
     processor 115 heartbeat authentication and communication functions to
     strengthen the verification of a proper service policy implementation of
     the embodiments of FIG. 19. For example, the heartbeat function can be
     used as authentication for service monitoring versus network reports. In
     addition, the heartbeat function can be used as authentication for
     challenge/response queries of agents. Also, the heartbeat function can be
     used as authentication for access control. In some embodiments, to
     strengthen verification of the basic system illustrated in FIG. 19, the
     communication access to the policy implementation agent 1690 is
     restricted so that software or hardware on device 100 and/or on a network
     cannot have authorized access to the policy implementation agent 1690.
     For example, authorized access to the policy implementation agent 1690
     can be restricted to include only the service controller 122 through the
     service control device link 1691 and the service control server link
     1638. For example, the agent control bus 1630 can be secured with
     encryption and/or other security techniques so that only the service
     control device link 1691 can have authorized access to the policy
     implementation agent 1690. As another example, the agent level message
     encryption can be used as described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0304] In some embodiments, the service policy implementation agent 1690
     of the embodiments of FIG. 19 can be further strengthened against errors,
     intrusion, tampering, hacking and/or other inadvertent or intentional
     integrity degradation by using various other techniques. For example, the
     dynamic agent download feature of the service controller 122 can download
     a new version of the policy implementation agent 1690. In this example,
     the new agent code can be identical in functionality and also hashed,
     obfuscated or ordered differently before signing and encryption so that
     any hacking attempt must be reinitiated, and this process can be
     periodically repeated or repeated upon a triggering event. Additionally,
     once the new dynamically loaded agent is in place, it can be required to
     perform an environment scan to determine if the system configuration or
     operation are as expected, and/or it can seek to detect elements in the
     execution environment that can be harmful or threatening to the integrity
     of the policy implementation. The agent can also be required to report
     back on the scan within a relatively short period of time so that any
     attempt to compromise the agent does not have sufficient time to be
     effective.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0305] In some embodiments, the service policy implementation agent 1690
     of the embodiments of FIG. 19 can be further strengthened to protect the
     policy implementation from compromise attempts by locating the software
     and/or hardware used onto an access modem associated with the service.
     For example, the modem can make it difficult to get access to the policy
     implementation agent 1690 by employing one or more security elements on
     one or more access ports into the modem, such as the device bus, an I/O
     port, a network connection or the debug port. The modem can also store
     and/or execute the policy implementation agent in secure memory. The
     modem can also require a secure download key or a secure software
     signature to accept any updates to the agent software.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0306] In some embodiments, the service policy implementation agent 1690
     of the embodiments of FIG. 19 can be further strengthened against
     compromise attempts by performing scans of the device 100 code execution
     environment and/or code storage environment to identify potentially
     malicious and/or unwanted/untrusted software or hardware. For example,
     this function can be performed by the policy implementation agent 1690.
     The agent can have a local database of potentially malicious elements and
     compare the entries in the database against the elements detected locally
     using various malicious code, behavior blocking, intrusion detection,
     and/or other well known techniques for security analysis. Alternatively
     or in addition, the agent can communicate a list of some or all of the
     elements detected locally to the service controller 122 to augment or
     take the place of the database comparison function that can be performed
     locally, thereby performing such or further such security analysis on the
     network (e.g., by the service controller 122), and, in some embodiments,
     if not automatically detected, such elements detected locally (e.g.,
     and/or samples of such detected potentially malicious code or logs of
     potentially malicious/suspicious behavior/intrusions) forwarded to
     security analysts for the service provider for further security analysis
     (e.g., service provider security analysts and/or an outside security
     vendor engaged to protect the service provider's network and supported
     devices). In some embodiments, the agent detects new software downloads,
     installs and/or invocations and immediately issues an error flag report
     when potentially malicious software is downloaded, installed or invoked
     (e.g., file and network based on access security detection techniques).
     In some embodiments, the agent scans the local software loading and
     invocation activity along with a log of other software runtime events and
     regularly reports this trace so that when an error or compromise event
     occurs the trace preceding the event can be analyzed to determine the
     offending software or activity trace that took place to cause the
     compromise or error. For example, once the software or activity that
     caused the compromise is known or otherwise detected, it can be entered
     into a refreshed version of the database that the device and other
     devices use to detect potentially malicious precursor conditions.
     Examples of such precursor events can include software invocations,
     software downloads, a sequence of memory I/O events, a sequence of
     software access events, a sequence of network address or URL
     communications or downloads, or a sequence of access modem I/O activity.

   [0307] FIG. 20 is another functional diagram illustrating the service
     processor 115 and the service controller 122 in accordance with some
     embodiments. As shown in FIG. 20, the modem firewall 1655 has been
     removed, and firewall and access control and traffic shaping functions
     are performed in these embodiments by the policy implementation agent
     1690 and application interface agent 1693.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0308] FIG. 21 is another functional diagram illustrating the service
     processor 115 and the service controller 122 in accordance with some
     embodiments. FIG. 21 illustrates the various modem drivers and modems
     2122 through 2125 and 2141. In some embodiments, the modems, which
     include WWAN modem 2122, WLAN modem 2123, WPAN modem 2124, Ethernet modem
     2125, and Dial/DSL modem 2141, which are in communication with the modem
     bus 2120, connect the device to one or more networks. As shown, the
     service measurement points labeled I through VI represent various service
     measurement points for service monitor agent 1696 and/or other agents to
     perform various service monitoring activities. Each of these measurement
     points can have a useful purpose in various embodiments described herein.
     For example, each of the traffic measurement points that is employed in a
     given design can be used by a monitoring agent to track application layer
     traffic through the communication stack to assist policy implementation
     functions, such as the policy implementation agent 1690, or, in some
     embodiments, the modem firewall agent 1655 or the application interface
     agent 1693, in making a determination regarding the traffic parameters or
     type once the traffic is farther down in the communication stack where it
     is sometimes difficult or impossible to make a complete determination of
     traffic parameters. It should be noted that although the present
     invention does not need to implement any or all of the measurement points
     illustrated in FIG. 21 to have an effective implementation as was
     similarly shown with respect to FIG. 19, various embodiments benefit from
     these and/or similar measurement points. It should also be noted that the
     exact measurement points can be moved to different locations in the
     traffic processing stack, just as the various embodiments described
     herein can have the agents affecting policy implementation moved to
     different points in the traffic processing stack while still maintaining
     effective operation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0309] As shown in FIG. 21, measurement point I occurs at the application
     interface agent 1693 interface to the applications. At this measurement
     point, the application traffic can be monitored before it is framed,
     packetized or encrypted by the lower layers of the networking stack. For
     example, this allows inspection, characterization, tagging (literal or
     virtual) and, in some embodiments, shaping or control of services or
     traffic. At this measurement point, traffic can be more readily
     associated with applications, URLs or IP addresses, content type, service
     type, and other higher level parameters. For example, at this level email
     traffic and downloads, web browser applications and end points, media
     file transfers, application traffic demand, URL traffic demand and other
     such service monitoring parameters are more readily observed (e.g.,
     accessible in the clear without the need for deep packet inspection
     and/or decryption), recorded and possibly shaped or controlled. As
     described herein, it is also possible to monitor upstream traffic demand
     at this point and compare it to the other measurement points to determine
     if the traffic policies in place are meeting overall traffic control
     policy objectives or to determine if traffic policy implementation is
     operating properly. For example, the downstream delivered traffic can be
     optimally observed at this measurement point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0310] As shown in FIG. 21, traffic measurement points II and III are
     situated on the upstream and downstream sides of policy implementation
     agent 1690. As described herein, these two locations allow potential
     tracking of upstream and downstream traffic through the stack portions
     associated with the policy implementation agent 1690. These two locations
     also provide for potential cross-checking of how the policy
     implementation agent 1690 is impacting the demand and delivery of
     traffic. In a similar manner, measurement point III in connection with
     measurement point IV provide an opportunity for packet tracing through
     the stack components associated with the modem firewall 1655 and provide
     for the opportunity to observe the demand and delivery sides of the modem
     firewall 1655. Traffic measurement point V provides the potential for
     observing the traffic at the modem bus drivers for each of the modems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0311] As shown in FIG. 21, traffic measurement point VI provides, in some
     embodiments, the ultimate measure of access traffic, for example, the
     traffic that actually transacts over the access network through the
     modem. As shown, measurement point VI is at the modem side of the
     internal or external communications bus 1630, and it will be appreciated
     that, in some embodiments, this measurement point can be further down the
     modem stack closer to the MAC or physical layer (e.g., at the designer's
     discretion). An advantage of having a measurement point deep in the modem
     is, for example, that if the software or hardware that implements the
     measurement and reporting is well secured against compromise, then this
     measure can be almost as strong from a verification perspective as the
     measure that comes from the network (e.g., from the network elements).
     Accordingly, this makes it possible to compare this measure against the
     other measures to determine if there is a traffic path that is leaking
     past the other measurement point or one or more policy implementation
     points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0312] FIGS. 22A and 22B provide tables summarizing various service
     processor 115 agents (and/or components/functions implemented in software
     and/or hardware) in accordance with some embodiments. Many of these
     agents are similarly described above, and the tables shown in FIGS. 22A
     and 22B are not intended to be an exhaustive summary of these agents, nor
     an exhaustive description of all functions that the agents perform or are
     described herein, but rather FIGS. 22A and 22B are provided as a summary
     aid in understanding the basic functions of each agent in accordance with
     some embodiments and how the agents interact with one another, with the
     service controller server elements, and/or with other network functions
     in certain embodiments to form a reliable device based service delivery
     solution and/or platform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0313] FIG. 23 provides a table summarizing various service controller 122
     server elements (and/or components/functions implemented in software
     and/or hardware) in accordance with some embodiments. Many of these
     agents are similarly described above, and the table shown in FIG. 23 is
     not intended to be an exhaustive summary of these server elements, nor an
     exhaustive description of all functions that the elements perform or are
     described herein, but rather FIG. 23 is provided as a summary aid in
     understanding the basic functions of each element in accordance with some
     embodiments and how the elements interact with one another, certain
     network elements, and/or the service processor agents in certain
     embodiments to form a reliable device based service delivery solution
     and/or platform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0314] In some embodiments, it is desirable to provide a control plane
     between the service processor and the service controller using a flexible
     connection or communication path that, for example, will work between
     virtually any two network connection endpoints, one being the service
     controller and one being the device, in a secure yet scalable manner. In
     view of the embodiments described herein, one of ordinary skill in the
     art will recognize that it is possible to achieve such features with a
     variety of different embodiments that share similar core features to the
     embodiments described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Service Control Device Link and Continuous Heartbeat Authentication
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0315] As described herein, there are numerous ways to implement the
     control plane communication channel between the service processor 115 and
     the service controller 122. Various embodiments described herein disclose
     a secure and bandwidth efficient control plane that is compatible with
     any IP based network (including the ability to locate the service
     controller 122 over the Internet); provides for consistent device
     assisted service monitoring, control, verification and/or billing while
     roaming across multiple networks with different access technologies; and
     allows continuous device assisted service control verification and/or
     authentication with a variety of mechanisms for setting the transmission
     heartbeat frequency. Other techniques that could be used for this
     function include, for example, encapsulating the control plane in the
     access network control plane channel, encapsulating the control plane in
     IP or data packet framing mechanisms (e.g., IPV6), running a more
     conventional VPN or IPSEC channel, and/or using an independent access
     network connection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0316] FIG. 24 is a functional diagram illustrating the service control
     device link 1691 of the service processor 115 and the service control
     service link 1638 of the service controller 122 in accordance with some
     embodiments. In particular, the service control device link 1691 of the
     service processor 115 and the service control service link 1638 of the
     service controller 122 as shown in FIG. 24 provide for secure control
     plane communication over the service control link 1653 between the
     service processor 115 and the service controller 122 in accordance with
     some embodiments. Various embodiments include two or three layers of
     encryption in the service control link, with one embodiment or layer
     being implemented in the encrypt functions (2408, 2428) and decode
     functions (2412, 2422), and another embodiment or layer implemented in
     the transport services stack (2410, 2420). An optional third embodiment
     or layer of encryption is implemented below the transport services stack,
     for example, with IPSEC or another IP layer encryption, VPN or tunneling
     scheme. For example, various known security encryption techniques can be
     implemented in the encrypt functions (2408, 2428), with public/private or
     completely private keys and/or signatures so that very strong levels of
     security for service processor control plane traffic can be achieved even
     through the basic transport services (2410, 2420) implemented with
     standard secure or open Internet networking protocols, such as TLS or
     TCP. For example, the service processor agent communications local to the
     device can be conducted to and from the service controller elements via
     the service control device link 1691 connection to the agent
     communication bus 1630. The combination of the service control device
     link 1691 and the agent communication bus 1630, which in some embodiments
     is also securely encrypted or signed, provides a seamless, highly secure,
     asynchronous control plane connection between the service processor and
     service controller server elements and the service controller and service
     controller agents that works over a wide range of access networks, such
     as any access network that has the capability to connect IP or TCP
     traffic to another TCP or IP endpoint on the access network, another
     private network or over the Internet 120. As described herein, in some
     embodiments, the agent communication bus 1630 also provides a fourth
     level of encrypted or signed communication to form a secure closed system
     on the device for agent to agent communication, for example, making it
     very difficult or practically impossible for software or applications to
     gain access to one or more of the a service processor agents on the
     device in any way other than the service control device link 1691. In
     this way, in some embodiments, the agent communication bus 1630 and the
     service processor agents can only be accessed by one another as necessary
     or permitted by agent communication policies, or by the service
     controller or other authorized network function with proper security
     credentials communicating over the service control device link 1691.
     Additionally, in some embodiments, communications between a subset of two
     or more agents, or between one or more agents and one or more service
     controller server elements are encrypted with unique keys or signatures
     in such a way that a fourth level of security providing private point to
     point, point to multipoint, or multipoint to multipoint secure
     communication lines is provided.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0317] In some embodiments, all of the service control device link 1691
     communications are transformed into a continuous control plane
     connection, with a frequency based on the rate of service usage, a
     minimum set period between connections, and/or other methods for
     establishing communication frequency. In some embodiments, this heartbeat
     function provides a continuous verification link by which the service
     controller verifies that the service processor and/or device are
     operating properly with the correct service policies being implemented.
     In view of the following heartbeat function embodiments described herein,
     it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that different
     approaches for implementing the various heartbeat embodiments are
     possible, and it will be clear that there are many ways to achieve the
     essential features enabling a reliable, sometimes continuous control link
     and verification function for the purpose of assisting control of service
     usage in a verifiable manner. As shown, inside the service processor 115,
     the service control device link 1691 includes a heartbeat send counter
     2402 in communication with the agent communication bus 1630. For example,
     the heartbeat send counter 2402 can provide a count for triggering when a
     service processor 115 communication (e.g., periodic communication based
     on a heartbeat mechanism) should be sent to the service controller 122,
     and a heartbeat buffer 2404, also in communication with the agent
     communication bus 1630, buffers any such information for the next service
     processor 115 communication, in accordance with various heartbeat based
     embodiments, as similarly described herein. The heartbeat buffer 2404 is
     in communication with a framing element 2406 and an encrypt element 2408
     for framing and encrypting any service processor 115 communications
     transmitted to the service controller 122 by a transport services stack
     2410 over the service control link 1653. Similarly, as shown inside the
     service controller 122, the service control server link 1638 includes a
     heartbeat send counter 2434 in communication with a service controller
     network 2440, a heartbeat buffer 2432, also in communication with the
     service controller network 2440, buffers any such information for the
     next service controller 122 communication, in accordance with various
     heartbeat based embodiments, as similarly described herein. The heartbeat
     buffer 2432 is in communication with a framing element 2430 and an
     encrypt element 2428 for framing and encrypting any such service
     controller 122 communications transmitted to the service processor 115 by
     a transport services stack 2420 over the service control link 1653.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0318] As also shown inside the service processor 115 of FIG. 24, the
     service control device link 1691 includes a decode element 2412 for
     decoding any received service controller 122 communications (e.g.,
     decrypting encrypted communications), an unpack element 2414 for
     unpacking the received service controller 122 communications (e.g.,
     assembling packetized communications), and an agent route 2416 for
     routing the received service controller 122 communications (e.g.,
     commands, instructions, heartbeat related information or status reports,
     policy related information or configuration settings and/or updates,
     challenge/response queries, agent refreshes and/or new software for
     installation) to the appropriate agent of the service processor 115.
     Similarly, as shown inside the service controller 122, the service
     control server link 1638 also includes a decode element 2422 for decoding
     any received service processor 115 communications (e.g., decrypting
     encrypted communications), an unpack element 2424 for unpacking the
     received service processor 115 communications (e.g., assembling
     packetized communications), and an agent route 2426 for routing the
     received service processor 115 communications (e.g., responses to
     instructions and/or commands, heartbeat related information or status
     reports, policy related information or configuration settings and/or
     updates, challenge/response queries, agent status information, network
     service/cost usage and/or any other reporting related information) to the
     appropriate agent of the service controller 122. Accordingly, as
     described herein with respect to various embodiments, the various secure
     communications between the service controller 122 and the service
     processor 115 can be performed using the embodiment as shown in FIG. 24,
     and those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that a
     variety of other embodiments can be used to similarly provide the various
     secure communications between the service controller 122 and the service
     processor 115 (e.g., using different software and/or hardware
     architectures to provide secure communications, such as using additional
     and/or fewer elements/functions or other design choices for providing
     such secure communications).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0319] In some embodiments, an efficient and effective communication
     framing structure between the service processor and service controller is
     provided, and the following embodiments (e.g., as shown and described
     with respect to FIG. 25) teach such a structure that packs the various
     service processor agent control plane communications and the various
     service controller element control plane connections into a format that
     does not consume excessive bandwidth to enable a continuous control plane
     connection between the device and service controller. In some
     embodiments, an efficient and effective communication framing structure
     between the service processor and service controller is provided to
     buffer such communication messages for some period of time before framing
     and transmitting, such as in a heartbeat frequency that is based on rate
     of service usage. In some embodiments, an efficient and effective
     communication framing structure between the service processor and service
     controller is provided to allow for the frame to be easily packed,
     encrypted, decoded, unpacked and the messages distributed. In view of the
     various embodiments described herein, it will be apparent to one of
     ordinary skill in the art that many framing structures will work for the
     intended purpose of organizing or framing agent communications and the
     uniqueness and importance of combining such a system element with the
     device service controller functions, the service processor functions, the
     service control verification functions and/or the other purposes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0320] FIG. 25 is a functional diagram illustrating a framing structure of
     a service processor communication frame 2502 and a service controller
     communication frame 2522 in accordance with some embodiments. In
     particular, the service control device link 1691 of the service processor
     115 and the service control service link 1638 of the service controller
     122 (e.g., as shown in FIG. 24) provide for secure control plane
     communication over the service control link 1653 between the service
     processor 115 and the service controller 122 using communication frames
     in the format of the service processor communication frame 2502 and the
     service controller communication frame 2522 as shown in FIG. 25 in
     accordance with some embodiments. As shown, the service processor
     communication frame 2502 includes a service processor framing sequence
     number 2504, a time stamp 2506, an agent first function ID 2508, an agent
     first function message length 2510, an agent first function message 2512,
     and assuming more than one message is being transmitted in this frame, an
     agent Nth function ID 2514, an agent Nth function message length 2516,
     and an agent Nth function message 2518. Accordingly, the service
     processor communication frame 2502 can include one or more messages as
     shown in FIG. 25, which can depend on networking frame length
     requirements and/or other design choices. Similarly, as shown, the
     service controller communication frame 2522 includes a service controller
     framing sequence number 2524, a time stamp 2526, an agent first function
     ID 2528, an agent first function message length 2530, an agent first
     function message 2532, and assuming more than one message is being
     transmitted in this frame, an agent Nth function ID 2534, an agent Nth
     function message length 2536, and an agent Nth function message 2538.
     Accordingly, the service controller communication frame 2522 can include
     one or more messages as shown in FIG. 25, which can depend on networking
     frame length requirements and/or other design choices.

     above, and the tables shown in FIGS. 28A-28E are not intended to be an
     exhaustive summary of these techniques for protecting the device based
     service policy from compromise, but rather are provided as an aid in

   [0325] FIG. 29 is a functional diagram illustrating a device

     part in data path operations to achieve various data path improvements,
     and, for example, several other service agents can manage the policy
     settings for the data path service, implement billing for the data path
     service, manage one or more modem selection and settings for access
     network connection, interface with the user and/or provide service policy
     implementation verification. Additionally, in some embodiments, several
     agents perform functions to assist in verifying that the service control
     or monitoring policies intended to be in place are properly implemented,
     the service control or monitoring policies are being properly adhered to,
     that the service processor or one or more service agents are operating
     properly, to prevent unintended errors in policy implementation or
     control, and/or to prevent tampering with the service policies or
     control. As shown, the service measurement points labeled I through VI
     represent various service measurement points for service monitor agent
     1696 and/or other agents to perform various service monitoring
     activities. Each of these measurement points can have a useful purpose in
     various embodiments described herein. For example, each of the traffic
     measurement points that is employed in a given design can be used by a
     monitoring agent to track application layer traffic through the
     communication stack to assist policy implementation functions, such as
     the policy implementation agent 1690, or in some embodiments the modem
     firewall agent 1655 or the application interface agent 1693, in making a
     determination regarding the traffic parameters or type once the traffic
     is farther down in the communication stack where it is sometimes
     difficult or impossible to make a complete determination of traffic
     parameters. For example, a detailed set of embodiments describing how the
     various measurement points can be used to help strengthen the
     verification of the service control implementation are described herein,
     including, for example, the embodiments described with respect to FIG. 16
     and FIG. 21. The particular locations for the measurement points provided
     in these figures are intended as instructional examples, and other
     measurement points can be used for different embodiments, as will be
     apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments
     described herein. Generally, in some embodiments, one or more measurement
     points within the device can be used to assist in service control
     verification and/or device or service troubleshooting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0326] In some embodiments, the service monitor agent and/or other agents
     implement virtual traffic tagging by tracking or tracing packet flows
     through the various communication stack formatting, processing and
     encryption steps, and providing the virtual tag information to the
     various agents that monitor, control, shape, throttle or otherwise
     observe, manipulate or modify the traffic. This tagging approach is
     referred to herein as virtual tagging, because there is not a literal
     data flow, traffic flow or packet tag that is attached to flows or
     packets, and the book-keeping to tag the packet is done through tracking
     or tracing the flow or packet through the stack instead. In some
     embodiments, the application interface and/or other agents identify a
     traffic flow, associate it with a service usage activity and cause a
     literal tag to be attached to the traffic or packets associated with the
     activity. This tagging approach is referred to herein as literal tagging.
     There are various advantages with both the virtual tagging and the
     literal tagging approaches. For example, it can be preferable in some
     embodiments to reduce the inter-agent communication required to track or
     trace a packet through the stack processing by assigning a literal tag so
     that each flow or packet has its own activity association embedded in the
     data. As another example, it can be preferable in some embodiments to
     re-use portions of standard communication stack software or components,
     enhancing the verifiable traffic control or service control capabilities
     of the standard stack by inserting additional processing steps associated
     with the various service agents and monitoring points rather than
     re-writing the entire stack to correctly process literal tagging
     information, and in such cases, a virtual tagging scheme may be desired.
     As yet another example, some standard communication stacks provide for
     unused, unspecified or otherwise available bit fields in a packet frame
     or flow, and these unused, unspecified or otherwise available bit fields
     can be used to literally tag traffic without the need to re-write all of
     the standard communication stack software, with only the portions of the
     stack that are added to enhance the verifiable traffic control or service
     control capabilities of the standard stack needing to decode and use the
     literal tagging information encapsulated in the available bit fields. In
     the case of literal tagging, in some embodiments, the tags are removed
     prior to passing the packets or flows to the network or to the
     applications utilizing the stack. In some embodiments, the manner in
     which the virtual or literal tagging is implemented can be developed into
     a communication standard specification so that various device or service
     product developers can independently develop the communication stack
     and/or service processor hardware and/or software in a manner that is
     compatible with the service controller specifications and the products of
     other device or service product developers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0327] It will be appreciated that although the implementation/use of any
     or all of the measurement points illustrated in FIG. 29 is not required
     to have an effective implementation, such as was similarly shown with
     respect to various embodiments described herein, such as with respect to
     FIGS. 19 and 21, various embodiments can benefit from these and/or
     similar measurement points. It will also be appreciated that the exact
     measurement points can be moved to different locations in the traffic
     processing stack, just as the various embodiments described herein can
     have the agents affecting policy implementation moved to different points
     in the traffic processing stack while still maintaining effective
     operation. In some embodiments, one or more measurement points are
     provided deeper in the modem stack (e.g., such as for embodiments
     similarly described herein with respect to FIGS. 35 and 36) where, for
     example, it is more difficult to circumvent and can be more difficult to
     access for tampering purposes if the modem is designed with the proper
     software and/or hardware security to protect the integrity of the modem
     stack and measurement point(s).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0328] Referring to FIG. 29, describing the device communications stack
     from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown, the device
     communications stack provides a communication layer for each of the
     modems of the device at the bottom of the device communications stack.
     Example measurement point VI resides within or just above the modem
     driver layer. For example, the modem driver performs modem bus
     communications, data protocol translations, modem control and
     configuration to interface the networking stack traffic to the modem. As
     shown, measurement point VI is common to all modem drivers and modems,
     and it is advantageous for certain embodiments to differentiate the
     traffic or service activity taking place through one modem from that of
     one or more of the other modems. In some embodiments, measurement point
     VI, or another measurement point, is located over, within or below one or
     more of the individual modem drivers. The respective modem buses for each
     modem reside between example measurement points V and VI. In the next
     higher layer, a modem selection &amp; control layer for multimode device
     based communication is provided. In some embodiments, this layer is
     controlled by a network decision policy that selects the most desirable
     network modem for some or all of the data traffic, and when the most
     desirable network is not available the policy reverts to the next most
     desirable network until a connection is established provided that one of
     the networks is available. In some embodiments, certain network traffic,
     such as verification, control, redundant or secure traffic, is routed to
     one of the networks even when some or all of the data traffic is routed
     to another network. This dual routing capability provides for a variety
     of enhanced security, enhanced reliability or enhanced manageability
     devices, services or applications. In the next higher layer, a modem
     firewall is provided. For example, the modem firewall provides for
     traditional firewall functions, but unlike traditional firewalls, in
     order to rely on the firewall for verifiable service usage control, such
     as access control and security protection from unwanted networking
     traffic or applications, the various service verification techniques and
     agents described herein are added to the firewall function to verify
     compliance with service policy and prevent tampering of the service
     controls. In some embodiments, the modem firewall is implemented farther
     up the stack, possibly in combination with other layers as indicated in
     other figures. In some embodiments, a dedicated firewall function or
     layer is provided that is independent of the other processing layers,
     such as the policy implementation layer, the packet forwarding layer
     and/or the application layer. In some embodiments, the modem firewall is
     implemented farther down the stack, such as within the modem drivers,
     below the modem drivers, or in the modem itself. Example measurement
     point IV resides between the modem firewall layer and an IP queuing and
     routing layer. As shown, an IP queuing and routing layer is separate from
     the policy implementation layer where the policy implementation agent
     implements a portion of the traffic control and/or service usage control
     policies. As described herein, in some embodiments, these functions are
     separated so that a standard network stack function can be used for IP
     queuing and routing, and the modifications necessary to implement the
     policy implementation agent functions can be provided in a new layer
     inserted into the standard stack. In some embodiments, the IP queuing and
     routing layer is combined with the traffic or service usage control
     layer. Examples of this combined functionality are shown and described
     with respect to FIGS. 31, 32 and 33. For example, a combined routing and
     policy implementation layer embodiment can also be used with the other
     embodiments, such as shown in FIG. 29. Various detailed embodiments
     describing how the policy implementation layer can control traffic or
     other service usage activities are described with respect to FIG. 38.
     Measurement point III resides between the IP queuing and routing layer
     and a policy implementation agent layer. Measurement point II resides
     between the policy implementation agent layer and the transport layer,
     including TCP, UDP, and other IP as shown. The session layer resides
     above the transport layer, which is shown as a socket assignment and
     session management (e.g., basic TCP setup, TLS/SSL) layer. The network
     services API (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP
     (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP3, DNS) resides above the session
     layer. Measurement point I resides between the network services API layer
     and an application layer, shown as application service interface agent in
     the device communications stack of FIG. 29.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0329] As shown, the application service interface layer is above the
     standard networking stack API and, in some embodiments, its function is
     to monitor and in some cases intercept and process the traffic between
     the applications and the standard networking stack API. In some
     embodiments, the application service interface layer identifies
     application traffic flows before the application traffic flows are more
     difficult or practically impossible to identify farther down in the
     stack. In some embodiments, the application service interface layer in
     this way assists application layer tagging in both the virtual and
     literal tagging cases. In the case of upstream traffic, the application
     layer tagging is straight forward, because the traffic originates at the
     application layer. In some downstream embodiments, where the traffic or
     service activity classification relies on traffic attributes that are
     readily obtainable, such as source address or URL, application socket
     address, IP destination address, time of day or any other readily
     obtained parameter, the traffic type can be identified and tagged for
     processing by the firewall agent or another agent as it initially
     arrives. In other embodiments, as described herein, in the downstream
     case, the solution is generally more sophisticated when a traffic
     parameter that is needed to classify the manner in which the traffic flow
     is to be controlled or throttled is not readily available at the lower
     levels of the stack, such as association with an aspect of an
     application, type of content, something contained within TLS, IPSEC or
     other secure format, or other information associated with the traffic.
     Accordingly, in some embodiments the networking stack identifies the
     traffic flow before it is fully characterized, categorized or associated
     with a service activity, and then passes the traffic through to the
     application interface layer where the final classification is completed.
     In such embodiments, the application interface layer then communicates
     the traffic flow ID with the proper classification so that after an
     initial short traffic burst or time period the policy implementation
     agents can properly control the traffic. In some embodiments, there is
     also a policy for tagging and setting service control policies for
     traffic that cannot be fully identified with all sources of tagging
     including application layer tagging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0330] Various applications and/or a user service interface agent
     communicate via this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such
     communications with a reference (A)). Also, the billing agent, which is
     in communication with the agent communication bus 1630, communicates user
     information and decision query and/or user input to the user service
     interface agent, as shown. The policy control agent communicates service
     settings and/or configuration information via this communications bus
     1630, as shown (illustrating such communications with a reference (B) via
     the application layer, policy implementation agent layer, which is lower
     in the communications stack as shown, and/or the modem firewall layer).
     The connection manager agent communicates select and control commands
     and/or modem and access network information via this communications
     stack, as shown (illustrating such communications with a reference (C)
     via the modem selection and control layer). Various other communications
     (e.g., service processor and/or service controller related
     communications, such as service usage measure information and/or
     application information) are provided at various levels of this
     communications stack, as shown (illustrating such communications with
     references (D) at the application layer, (E) at the policy implementation
     agent layer, and (F) at the modem firewall layer).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0331] As shown in FIG. 29, a service monitor agent, which is also in
     communication with the agent communication bus 1630, communicates with
     various layers of the device communications stack. For example, the
     service monitor agent, performs monitoring at each of measurement points
     I through VI, receiving information including application information,
     service usage and other service related information, and assignment
     information. An access control integrity agent is in communication with
     the service monitor agent via the agent communications bus 1630, as also
     shown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0332] In some embodiments, one or more of the networking stack
     modifications described herein in combination one or more of the service
     verification and tamper prevention techniques described herein is
     provided. As similarly described with respect to FIG. 29, the various
     example embodiments for assisting service control verification described
     herein and as summarized in the example tables provided in FIGS. 26, 27
     and 28 can be employed individually or in combination to create
     increasingly secure cross-functional service control verification
     embodiments. In FIG. 29, the presence of the access control integrity
     agent, policy control agent, service monitor agent and the other agents
     that perform verification and/or tamper prevention functions illustrates
     verifiable service control aspects in accordance with some embodiments.
     Furthermore, the presence of the billing agent combined with the service
     verification and/or tamper prevention agents and techniques described
     herein provides for a set of verifiable billing embodiments for service
     billing, service billing offset corrections, bill by account, transaction
     billing and other billing functions. In addition, the presence of the
     user service interface agent in combination with the service control
     agent functions in the modified networking stack provide for embodiments
     involving a combination of service control with user preferences, which
     as described herein, provides the user with the capability to optimize
     service versus service cost in a network neutral manner. In some
     embodiments, the user control of service control policy is provided along
     with the service control verification and/or tamper prevention. The
     presence of the policy control agent that in some embodiments implements
     a higher than most basic level of policy decision and control with the
     policy implementation agents in the modified networking stack allows for,
     for example, the device to possess the capability to implement a higher
     level of service control for the purpose of obtaining a higher level
     service usage or service activity objective. In some embodiments, the
     application layer tagging in combination with other embodiments described
     herein provides for deep service activity control that is verifiable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0333] In some embodiments, verifiable traffic shaping as described herein
     can be performed using the device communications stack in a variety of
     embodiments for the combination of service control within the networking
     stack and service control verification and/or tamper prevention, with
     various embodiments depicted in FIGS. 29 through 37. Additional levels of
     detail regarding how such embodiments can be used to implement verifiable
     traffic shaping are provided in and described with respect to FIGS. 38
     through 40 which depict example functional diagrams of packet processing
     flows for verifiable traffic shaping or service activity control in a
     device service processor for both upstream and downstream flows. Along
     with several other interesting features embodied in FIGS. 38 through 40,
     application traffic layer tagging is depicted in additional detail in
     accordance with some embodiments. For example, the application interface
     agent can determine service data usage at the application layer using
     measurement point I and a local service usage counter, and can, for
     example, pass this information to the service monitor agent. If service
     usage exceeds a threshold, or if using a service usage prediction
     algorithm results in predicted service usage that will exceed a
     threshold, then the user can be notified of which applications are
     causing the service usage overrun or potential service usage overrun, via
     the user service interface agent. The user can then identify which
     application service (e.g., traffic associated with a specified high
     service use or non-critical application, such as for example a high
     bandwidth consumption social networking website or service, media
     streaming website or service, or any other high bandwidth website or
     service transmitting and/or receiving data with the service network) that
     the user prefers to throttle. As another example, the user could select a
     service policy that allows for video chat services until those services
     threaten to cause cost over-runs on the user's service plan, and at that
     time the service policy could switch the chat service to voice only and
     not transmit or receive the video. The traffic associated with the user
     specified application can then be throttled according to user preference
     input. For example, for downstream traffic, packets (e.g., packets that
     are virtually or literally tagged and/or otherwise associated with the
     application traffic to be throttled) from the access network can be
     buffered, delayed and/or dropped to throttle the identified application
     traffic. For upstream traffic, packets (e.g., packets that are virtually
     or literally tagged and/or otherwise associated with the application
     traffic to be throttled) can be buffered, delayed and/or dropped before
     being transmitted to the access network to throttle the identified
     application traffic. As similarly described above, traffic shaping as
     described herein can be verified, such as by the service monitor agent
     via the various measurement points and/or using other agents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0334] The embodiments depicted in FIG. 30 and other figures generally
     require enhancements to conventional device networking communication
     stack processing. For example, these enhancements can be implemented in
     whole or in part in the kernel space for the device OS, in whole or in
     part in the application space for the device, or partially in kernel
     space and partially in application space. As described herein, the
     networking stack enhancements and the other elements of the service
     processor can be packaged into a set of software that is pre-tested or
     documented to enable device manufacturers to quickly implement and bring
     to market the service processor functionality in a manner that is
     compatible with the service controller and the applicable access
     network(s). For example, the service processor software can also be
     specified in an interoperability standard so that various manufacturers
     and software developers can develop service processor implementations or
     enhancements, or service controller implementations or enhancements that
     are compatible with one another.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0335] FIG. 30 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In some embodiments, a portion of the service processor
     is implemented on the modem (e.g., on modem module hardware or modem
     chipset) and a portion of the service processor is implemented on the
     device application processor subsystem. It will be apparent to one of
     ordinary skill in the art that variations of the embodiment depicted in
     FIG. 30 are possible where more or less of the service processor
     functionality is moved onto the modem subsystem or onto the device
     application processor subsystem. For example, such embodiments similar to
     that depicted in FIG. 30 can be motivated by the advantages of containing
     some or all of the service processor network communication stack
     processing and/or some or all of the other service agent functions on the
     modem subsystem (e.g., and such an approach can be applied to one or more
     modems). For example, the service processor can be distributed as a
     standard feature set contained in a modem chipset hardware of software
     package or modem module hardware or software package, and such a
     configuration can provide for easier adoption or development by device
     OEMs, a higher level of differentiation for the chipset or modem module
     manufacturer, higher levels of performance or service usage control
     implementation integrity or security, specification or interoperability
     standardization, and/or other benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0336] Referring to FIG. 30, describing the device communications stack
     from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown, the device
     communications stack provides a communication layer for modem MAC/PHY
     layer at the bottom of the device communications stack. Measurement point
     IV resides above the modem MAC/PHY layer. The modem firewall layer
     resides between measurement points IV and III. In the next higher layer,
     the policy implementation agent is provided, in which the policy
     implementation agent is implemented on the modem (e.g., on modem
     hardware). Measurement point II resides between the policy implementation
     agent and the modem driver layer, which is then shown below a modem bus
     layer. The next higher layer is shown as the IP queuing and routing
     layer, followed by the transport layer, including TCP, UDP, and other IP
     as shown. The session layer resides above the transport layer, which is
     shown as a socket assignment and session management (e.g., basic TCP
     setup, TLS/SSL) layer. The network services API (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP
     (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP3,
     DNS) resides above the session layer. Measurement point I resides between
     the network services API layer and an application layer, shown as
     application service interface agent in the device communications stack of
     FIG. 30.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0337] Various applications and/or a user service interface agent
     communicate via this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such
     communications with a reference (A)). Also, the billing agent, which is
     in communication with the agent communication bus 1630 communications
     user information and decision query and/or user input to the user service
     interface agent, as shown. The policy control agent B communicates
     service settings and/or configuration information via this communications
     stack, as shown (illustrating such communications with a reference (B))
     via the application layer. The policy control agent A communicates
     service settings and/or configuration information via this communications
     stack, as shown (illustrating such communications with a reference (D))
     via the policy implementation agent layer and/or the modem firewall
     layer. The connection manager agent communicates select &amp; control
     commands and/or modem and access network information via this
     communications stack, as shown (illustrating such communications with a
     reference (C)) via the modem driver layer. Various other communications
     (e.g., service processor and/or service controller related
     communications, such as service usage measure information, and/or
     application information) are provided at various levels of this
     communications stack, as shown (illustrating such communications with
     references (E)) at the application layer through the modem driver layer
     with the service monitor agent B as shown (and an access control
     integrity agent B is also shown), and communications with references (F)
     at the policy implementation agent layer and (G) at the modem firewall
     layer with the service monitor agent A as shown (and an access control
     integrity agent A is also shown). In some embodiments, the service usage
     policy verification or tamper prevention embodiments described herein can
     be applied, in isolation or in combination, in the context of FIG. 31 to
     provide for embodiments with increasing levels of service usage policy
     control verification certainty, such as provided with FIGS. 26A-26H,
     27A-27P and 28A-28E.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0338] FIG. 31 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In some embodiments, the service processor is a
     simplified implementation. For example, this approach can be used for
     applications with less capable device application processors, rapid time
     to market needs, fewer service usage control needs, and/or other reasons
     that lead to a need for a lower complexity implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0339] Referring to FIG. 31, describing the device communications stack
     from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown, the device
     communications stack provides a communication layer for the modem layer
     at the bottom of the device communications stack. The modem driver layer
     resides above the modem bus layer as shown. In the next higher layer, the
     policy implementation agent is provided, and the policy implementation
     agent is also in communication with the agent communication bus 1630 as
     shown. The next higher layer is shown as the transport layer, including
     TCP, UDP, and other IP as shown. The session layer resides above the
     transport layer, which is shown as a socket assignment and session
     management (e.g., basic TCP setup, TLS/SSL) layer. The network services
     API (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail
     Transfer Protocol), POP3, DNS) resides above the session layer.
     Applications communicate with the device communications stack via the
     network services API as shown. Policy settings from the network (e.g.,
     service settings) are communicated with the policy implementation agent
     as shown. The connection manager communicates select and control as well
     as modem and access network information via the modem driver as shown.
     Although FIG. 31 does not depict all of the service usage control
     verification functions provided by certain embodiments calling for
     additional service verification or control agents, a high level of
     service policy implementation verification certainty can be achieved
     within the context of the embodiments depicted in FIG. 31 by applying a
     subset of the service usage policy verification or tamper prevention
     embodiments described herein. For example, the embodiments depicted in
     FIG. 31 can be combined with the service controller embodiments that
     utilize IPDRs to verify service usage is in accordance with the desired
     service policy. There are also many other service usage control
     embodiments described herein that can be applied in isolation or in
     combination to the embodiments depicted in FIG. 31 to provide increasing
     levels of service usage control verification certainty, as will be
     apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of FIGS. 26A-26H,
     27A-27P and 28A-28E and the various embodiments described herein.

   [0340] FIG. 32 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In some embodiments, the service processor is a
     simplified implementation embodiment with device based monitoring and
     integrity control. For example, FIG. 32 provides for somewhat higher
     complexity (e.g., relative to the embodiments depicted in FIG. 30) in
     exchange for the enhanced service monitoring, control or verification
     that are possible by implement additional agent embodiments, such as the
     service monitor agent and the access control integrity agent functions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0341] Referring to FIG. 32, describing the device communications stack
     from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown, the device
     communications stack provides a communication layer for each of the
     modems of the device at the bottom of the device communications stack.
     Measurement point II resides above the modem selection &amp; control layer,
     which resides above the modem buses for each modem. Measurement point I
     resides between the policy implementation agent (policy based
     router/firewall) layer and the transport layer, including TCP, UDP, and
     other IP as shown. The session layer resides above the transport layer,
     which is shown as a socket assignment and session management (e.g., basic
     TCP setup, TLS/SSL) layer. The network services API (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS,
     FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP3,
     DNS) resides above the session layer. Applications communicate with the
     device communications stack via the network services API as shown. Policy
     settings from the network (e.g., service settings) are communicated with
     the policy implementation agent as shown. The connection manager
     communicates select and control as well as modem and access network
     information via the modem selection and control layer as shown. The
     service monitor agent, which is also in communication with the agent
     communication bus 1630, communicates with various layers of the device
     communications stack. For example, the service monitor agent, performs
     monitoring at each of measurement points I and II, receiving information
     including application information, service usage and other service
     related information, and assignment information. An access control
     integrity agent is in communication with the service monitor agent via
     the agent communications bus 1630, as also shown. As similarly described
     with respect to FIGS. 30 and 31, many of the service usage control
     verification embodiments described herein can be applied in isolation or
     in combination in the context of FIG. 32.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0342] FIG. 33 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. Referring to FIG. 33, describing the device
     communications stack from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown,
     the device communications stack provides a communication layer for each
     of the modems of the device at the bottom of the device communications
     stack. Measurement point III resides above the modem selection &amp; control
     layer, which resides above the respective modem buses for each modem.
     Measurement point II resides between the policy implementation agent
     (policy based router/firewall) layer and the transport layer, including
     TCP, UDP, and other IP as shown. The session layer resides above the
     transport layer, which is shown as a socket assignment and session
     management (e.g., basic TCP setup, TLS/SSL) layer. The network services
     API (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail
     Transfer Protocol), POP3, DNS) resides above the session layer.
     Measurement point I resides between the network services API layer and an
     application layer, shown as application service interface agent in the
     device communications stack of FIG. 33.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0343] Various applications and/or a user service interface agent
     communicate via this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such
     communications with a reference (A)). Also, the billing agent, which is
     in communication with the agent communication bus 1630 communications
     user information and decision query and/or user input to the user service
     interface agent, as shown. The policy control agent communicates service
     settings and/or configuration information via this communications stack,
     as shown (illustrating such communications with a reference (B)) via the
     policy implementation agent layer. The connection manager agent
     communicates select &amp; control commands and/or modem and access network
     information via this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such
     communications with a reference (C)) via the modem selection and control
     layer. Various other communications (e.g., service processor and/or
     service controller related communications, such as service usage measure
     information, application information) are provided at various levels of
     this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such communications
     with references (D)) at the application layer and (E) at the policy
     implementation agent layer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0344] As shown in FIG. 33, a service monitor agent, which is also in
     communication with the agent communication bus 1630, communicates with
     various layers of the device communications stack. For example, the
     service monitor agent, performs monitoring at each of measurement points
     I through III, receiving information including application information,
     service usage and other service related information, and assignment
     information. An access control integrity agent is in communication with
     the service monitor agent via the agent communications bus 1630, as also
     shown. As similarly described with respect to FIGS. 30, 31 and 32, many
     of the service usage control verification embodiments disclosed herein
     can be applied in isolation or in combination in the context of FIG. 33.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0345] FIG. 34 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In some embodiments, the data path processing for the
     service processor is provided in conjunction with a single modem driver
     as shown. As shown, the service processor communication stack processing
     is provided below the standard network communication stack and in
     combination with a modem driver (e.g., and this approach can be extended
     to more than one modem).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0346] Referring to FIG. 34, describing the device communications stack
     from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown, the device
     communications stack provides a communication layer for each of the
     modems of the device at the bottom of the device communications stack.
     Measurement point II resides above the modem driver 1 layer. Measurement
     point I resides between the policy implementation agent (policy based
     router/firewall) layer and the modem selection and control layer, for the
     modem driver 1 stack in this single modem driver embodiment. The
     transport layer, including TCP, UDP, and other IP resides above the IP
     queuing and routing layer, which resides above the modem selection and
     control layer, as shown. The session layer, which is shown as a socket
     assignment and session management (e.g., basic TCP setup, TLS/SSL) layer,
     resides above the transport layer. The network services API (e.g., HTTP,
     HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
     Protocol), POP3, DNS) resides above the session layer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0347] As shown in FIG. 34, applications communicate with the device
     communications stack via the network services API as shown (illustrating
     such communications with a reference (A)). Policy settings from the
     network (e.g., service settings) are communicated with the policy
     implementation agent as shown (illustrating such communications with a
     reference (B)). The service monitor agent, which is also in communication
     with the agent communication bus 1630, communicates with policy
     implementation agent layer of the device communications stack. Also, the
     service monitor agent performs monitoring at each of measurement points I
     and II, receiving information including application information, service
     usage and other service related information, and assignment information.
     An access control integrity agent is in communication with the service
     monitor agent via the agent communications bus 1630, as also shown.
     Various other communications (e.g., service processor and/or service
     controller related communications, such as service usage measure
     information, application information) are provided at various levels of
     this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such communications
     with references (C)) at the policy implementation agent layer. Also, the
     billing agent, which is in communication with the agent communication bus
     1630 communications user information and decision query and/or user input
     to the user service interface agent, as shown. As similarly described
     with respect to FIGS. 30, 31, 32 and 33, many of the service usage
     control verification embodiments disclosed herein can be applied in
     isolation or in combination in the context of FIG. 34.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0348] FIG. 35 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In particular, FIG. 35 illustrates a single modem
     hardware embodiment as shown. As shown, the service processor network
     communication stack processing is provided on the modem hardware (e.g.,
     and this approach can be extended to more than one modem). This approach
     allows for the service processor to be distributed as a standard feature
     set contained in a modem chipset hardware of software package or modem
     module hardware or software package, which, for example, can provide for
     easier adoption or development by device OEMs, a higher level of
     differentiation for the chipset or modem module manufacturer, higher
     levels of performance or service usage control implementation integrity,
     or other benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0349] Referring to FIG. 35, describing the device communications stack
     from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown, the device
     communications stack provides a communication layer for each of the
     modems of the device at the bottom of the device communications stack. As
     shown, measurement points I and II and the policy implementation agent
     reside on the modem 1 (e.g., implemented as hardware and/or software on
     modem 1). Measurement point I resides above the policy implementation
     agent (policy based router/firewall) layer, and measurement point II
     resides below the policy implementation agent later. The modem selection
     and control layer resides above the modem drivers layer, as shown. The
     transport layer, including TCP, UDP, and other IP resides above the IP
     queuing and routing layer, which resides above the modem selection and
     control layer, as shown. The session layer, which is shown as a socket
     assignment and session management (e.g., basic TCP setup, TLS/SSL) layer,
     resides above the transport layer. The network services API (e.g., HTTP,
     HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
     Protocol), POP3, DNS) resides above the session layer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0350] As shown in FIG. 35, applications communicate with the device
     communications stack via the network services API as shown. Policy
     settings from the network (e.g., service settings) are communicated with
     the policy implementation agent as shown (illustrating such
     communications with a reference (A)). The service monitor agent, which is
     also in communication with the agent communication bus 1630, communicates
     with policy implementation agent layer of the modem 1. Also, the service
     monitor agent performs monitoring at each of measurement points I and II,
     receiving information including application information, service usage
     and other service related information, and assignment information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0351] An access control integrity agent is in communication with the
     service monitor agent via the agent communications bus 1630, as also
     shown. Various other communications (e.g., service processor and/or
     service controller related communications, such as service usage measure
     information and/or application information) are provided at various
     levels of this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such
     communications with references (B)) at the policy implementation agent
     layer. As similarly described with respect to FIGS. 30, 31, 32, 33 and
     34, many of the service usage control verification embodiments disclosed
     herein can be applied in isolation or in combination in the context of
     FIG. 35.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0352] FIG. 36 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In particular, FIG. 36 illustrates a single modem
     hardware embodiment, in which modem 1 includes a portion of the service
     processor networking communication stack processing and measurement
     points II and III and the policy implementation agent, as similarly shown
     in FIG. 35, and the higher levels of the device communications stack
     above the modem 1 layer, such as the application service interface layer,
     are implemented on the device application processor or in the device
     application processor memory as similarly described above, for example,
     with respect to FIG. 33, in which a measurement point I is shown between
     the application service interface agent layer and the network services
     API layer. For example, this approach allows for the application service
     interface agent to be provided on the device application processor or
     memory so that application layer service usage monitoring or control can
     be implemented. For example, the differences between the embodiments
     depicted in FIG. 36 and those of FIG. 30 include a simplified
     implementation and a policy control agent that is entirely implemented on
     the modem and not partially implemented in the application processor
     memory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0353] Various applications and/or a user service interface agent
     communicate via this communications stack, as shown (illustrating such
     communications with a reference (A)). Also, the billing agent, which is
     in communication with the agent communication bus 1630 communications
     user information and decision query and/or user input to the user service
     interface agent, as shown. The policy control agent communicates service
     settings and/or configuration information via this communications stack,
     as shown (illustrating such communications with a reference (B)) via the
     policy implementation agent layer. Various other communications (e.g.,
     service processor and/or service controller related communications, such
     as service usage measure information and/or application information) are
     provided at various levels of this communications stack, as shown
     (illustrating such communications with reference (C) at the application
     layer and communications with reference (D) at the policy implementation
     agent layer). As shown, the service monitor agent B communicates with the
     application service interface agent and measurement point I, and the
     service monitor agent A communicates with the policy implementation agent
     layer and measurement points II and III of the modem 1. As similarly
     described with respect to FIGS. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35, many of the
     service usage control verification embodiments disclosed herein can be
     applied in isolation or in combination in the context of FIG. 36.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0354] FIG. 37 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     communications stack that allows for implementing traffic shaping policy,
     access control policy and/or service monitoring policy in accordance with
     some embodiments. In particular, FIG. 37 illustrates a device
     communications stack as similarly shown in FIG. 36, with the difference
     being that the service processor subsystem networking communication stack
     processing is implemented on a hardware function that is separate from
     the application processor and the modem. For example, this approach
     provides security advantages with a dedicated hardware system to protect
     some or all of the service usage control system from tampering. For
     example, some or all of the service processor can be implemented on a SIM
     card module. As another example, some or all of the service processor can
     be encapsulated on a self contained hardware module that can be added to
     a device without the need to modify the networking communication stack
     software or hardware.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0355] FIG. 38 is a functional diagram illustrating a device service
     processor packet processing flow in accordance with some embodiments. In
     particular, both an example upstream service processor packet processing
     flow (device to the network) and an example downstream service processor
     packet processing flow (network to the device) are shown in FIG. 38. For
     example, the service processor packet processing flow can be performed by
     the device communications stack, such as described above with respect to
     FIG. 29. The various embodiments for packet processing flow depicted in
     FIGS. 38 through 40 are self explanatory to one of ordinary skill in the
     art and not all the processing steps and flow sequences are described
     herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0356] In some embodiments, the burst size, buffer delay, acknowledgement
     delay and drop rate used in upstream and downstream traffic shaping are
     optimized with the goal of reducing access network traffic overhead, and
     excess capacity usage that can result from mismatches in traffic
     transmission parameters with the access network MAC and PHY or from
     excess network level packet delivery protocol re-transmissions. In some
     embodiments, an application interface agent 1693 is used to literally tag
     or virtually tag application layer traffic so that the policy
     implementation agent(s) 1690 has the necessary information to implement
     selected traffic shaping solutions. As shown in FIG. 16, the application
     interface agent 1693 is in communication with various applications,
     including a TCP application 1604, an IP application 1605, and a voice
     application 1602.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0357] Referring to FIGS. 38 through 40, in some embodiments, the upstream
     traffic service policy implementation step corresponds to the traffic
     shaping step described herein. Referring to FIG. 38, this step is
     depicted as shown as an alternate exploded view including four upstream
     sub-steps of apply QoS queue priority, apply traffic shaping rules,
     network optimized buffer/delay and remove application ID tag. An
     additional approach shown in FIG. 38 involves two exploded view sub-steps
     associated with the firewall service policy implementation step and these
     sub-steps are pass/block packet and pass/redirect packet. For example,
     the functions performed by these six sub-steps can be depicted in any
     number of sub-steps, the order of the steps can be appropriately
     performed in various different orders to provide for upstream traffic
     shaping within the network communication stack. For example, FIGS. 39 and
     40 show the two steps of policy implementation and firewall as one step
     and the six exploded view sub-steps are included under the same policy
     implementation step and are performed in a different order than in FIG.
     38. It should also be noted that a number of embodiments are possible in
     which the access control, traffic control or firewall functions are moved
     to the application service interface layer or another layer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0358] Referring now to the downstream portion of FIG. 38, there are two
     steps again termed traffic service policy implementation and firewall
     service policy implementation in this traffic shaping, access control and
     firewall example. These two packet flow processing steps are depicted as
     shown in the exploded view as the five sub-steps of tag with flow ID,
     pass/block packet, apply QoS, apply traffic shaping rules and network
     optimized buffer, delay, and drop. As with the upstream packet processing
     flow, the number of sub-steps, the order of sub-steps and the location of
     the sub-steps in the downstream networking stack processing can be
     depicted in any number of sub-steps, order and/or location, and various
     other embodiments will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art,
     including embodiments which locate some or all of the steps in the
     application service interface layer or other layers as depicted in FIGS.
     39 and 40. The details of the packet flow processing design for the
     downstream can be somewhat more complex in certain embodiments as
     compared to the upstream processing in two ways. First, as described
     herein, in some embodiments, the packet tagging that requires application
     level information can require the initial portion of the packet flow
     burst to pass through the upstream networking communication stack until
     the application service interface layer can associate the packet flow
     with the appropriate information visible at the application level at
     which time the packet flow tag is communicated to the other service
     processor agent functions so that they can properly monitor or control
     the traffic associated with the flow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0359] Independently, another complication arises when upper layer
     reliable communication protocols, such as TCP, are employed in the
     networking stack in which the downstream transmitting end repeats the
     packet transmission if the receiving TCP protocol stack does not send a
     packet receipt acknowledge (ACK) within a certain period of time. If
     packets are arbitrarily delayed or dropped, then the TCP re-transmission
     traffic can reduce, completely eliminate or even reverse the network
     capacity advantage gained by reducing the average traffic speed or other
     transmission quality measure for one or more service activities. To solve
     this problem, in some embodiments, the packet traffic control parameters
     (e.g., downstream delay, drops, burst length, burst frequency and/or
     burst jitter) are optimized for TCP re-transmission efficiency so that
     changes in traffic control access bandwidth or speed for one or more
     service activities are implemented in such a manner that the TCP
     re-transmission delay at the network transmitting end adapts to be long
     enough so that wasted packet re-transmission bandwidth is reduced. In
     addition, and either in combination or in isolation, in some embodiments,
     the packet traffic control parameters (e.g., downstream delay, drops,
     burst length, burst frequency and/or burst jitter) can be adjusted so
     that the access network downstream MAC and/or PHY efficiencies are
     optimized.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0360] Numerous other embodiments for the detailed implementation of
     packet flow processing in both downstream and upstream will be apparent
     to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the various embodiments
     described herein. In some embodiments, as described herein, the following
     are provided: (A) traffic shaping is performed in a verifiable manner,
     (B) traffic shaping is performed in a manner that results in improved
     network capacity by taking into account to some degree the manner in
     which the access network PHY layer and/or MAC layer responds to packet
     parameters (e.g. burst delay, burst drops, burst length, burst frequency
     and/or burst jitter), (C) traffic shaping is performed in a manner that
     results in improved network capacity by taking into account how the
     packet parameters (e.g., burst delay, burst drops, burst length, burst
     frequency and/or burst jitter) impact layer 3 and higher ACK protocol or
     other network protocol network capacity efficiencies, (D) packet shaping
     is performed in a manner that is aware of and optimized for the
     particular type of communication protocol or packets being sent (e.g.,
     TCP packets can be dropped to slow the application rate of transfer
     whereas UDP packets are never dropped, because there is no
     re-transmission), (E) a virtual or literal packet tagging system is used
     in a verifiable traffic shaping service control system to provide a
     deeper level of service monitoring and control or to simplify the
     processing of the packets, and/or (F) starting with these low level
     packet processing, traffic control or access control building blocks one
     or more additional layers of higher level policy control can be added on
     the device or in the network to create service profiles for the service
     provider network that define complete services, such as ambient services
     and many other variations of service profile settings that each define a
     device or user service experience and can be associated with a billing
     plan. For example, the use of higher layers of service profile control to
     form more complete service solutions starting with these relatively
     simple low-level traffic control, access control or firewall processing
     steps or functions is also described herein.

   [0361] FIG. 39 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     service processor packet processing flow in accordance with some
     embodiments. In particular, both an example upstream service processor
     packet processing flow (device to the network) and an example downstream
     service processor packet processing flow (network to the device) are
     shown in FIG. 39 (e.g., of a less feature rich device service processor
     embodiment, such as one similar to that depicted in FIG. 32).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0362] FIG. 40 is another functional diagram illustrating the device
     service processor packet processing flow in accordance with some
     embodiments. In particular, both an example upstream service processor
     packet processing flow (device to the network) and an example downstream
     service processor packet processing flow (network to the device) are
     shown in FIG. 40 (e.g., of a mid-featured embodiment of a device service
     processor, such as one similar to that depicted in FIG. 33).

   [0363] FIG. 41 provides a table summarizing various privacy levels for
     service history reporting in accordance with some embodiments. Many of
     these privacy levels are similarly described above, and the table shown
     in FIG. 41 is not intended to be an exhaustive summary of these privacy
     levels, but rather is provided as an aid in understanding these privacy
     levels in accordance with user privacy related embodiments described
     herein. For example, there are many other parameters that can be
     associated with privacy filtering, and as will be apparent to one of
     ordinary skill in the art in view of the various embodiments described
     herein, the unique feature of user defined or user influenced privacy
     filtering for service usage, service activity or CRM reports can be
     implemented with a variety of embodiments that are variations of those
     described herein.

   <br/>
   [0364] FIGS. 42A through 42J provide tables summarizing various service
     policy control commands in accordance with some embodiments. Many of
     these service policy control commands are similarly described above, and
     the tables shown in FIGS. 42A-J are not intended to be an exhaustive
     summary of these service policy control commands and do not include
     summaries of all the embodiments described herein, but rather are
     provided as a summary aid in understanding these service policy control
     commands in accordance with various embodiments described herein.

   <br/>
   [0365] In some embodiments, QoS is employed for devices with a service
     processor 115. For example, QoS can be employed in a crowded hot spot
     where the service processor 115 profile has been changed from WWAN to
     WLAN, but the WLAN is backed up as too many users are trying to use it.
     The service processor 115 can have a hierarchical access to the hotspot
     at that point; or the service processor 115 that pays less can be
     throttled while those that pay more are opened up; or the service
     processor 115 can initiate a policy that slows down transmissions to
     improve trunking efficiency.

   [0366] FIGS. 43A through 43B are flow diagrams illustrating a flow diagram
     for a service processor authorization sequence as shown in FIG. 43A and a
     flow diagram for a service controller authorization sequence as shown in
     FIG. 43B in accordance with some embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0367] Referring to FIG. 43A, at 4302, the device is in an offline state.
     At 4304, the service processor (e.g., service processor 115) of the
     device collects device service processor credentials and access control
     integrity information. At 4306, the service processor of the device
     selects a best network. At 4308, the device connects to an access
     network. At 4310, the service processor of the device sends an
     authorization request to the service controller (e.g., service controller
     122) and also sends the credentials and access control integrity
     information. At 4312, the service processor determines whether an
     integrity error has occurred. If so, then the service processor performs
     integrity error handling at 4314. Otherwise, the service processor
     determines whether the device is activated and/or authorized for network
     access at 4316. If not, then the service processor performs a device
     activation sequence at 4318. At 4320, the service processor performs the
     following: updates critical software, initializes service policy and
     control settings, synchronizes service counters, updates service cost
     data, applies policy settings, applies CRM rules settings, obtains
     transaction identity certificate, and sends stored CRM and billing
     information. At 4322, the device is in an online state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0368] Referring to FIG. 43B, at 4332, device control is in an offline
     state. At 4334, the service controller (e.g., service controller 122)
     receives a device authorization request, verifies device service plan
     standing, verifies device access control integrity standing, verifies
     device access control integrity information, verifies service processor
     heartbeat, and performs various additional service processor integrity
     checks (e.g., as similarly described herein). At 4336, the service
     controller determines whether the device integrity checks have all
     passed. If not, then the service controller sends an integrity error to
     the service processor (e.g., service processor 115) at 4338. At 4340, the
     service controller performs integrity error handling. Otherwise (the
     device integrity checks have all passed), the service controller
     determines whether the device is activated at 4342. If not, then the
     service controller sends an activation message to the service processor
     at 4344. At 4346, the service controller performs a service activation
     sequence. Otherwise (the device is activated), the service controller
     sends an authorization at 4348. At 4350, the service controller performs
     the following: updates critical software on the service processor,
     initializes service policy and control settings, synchronizes service
     counters, updates service cost data, applies policy settings, applies CRM
     rules settings, obtains transaction identity certificate, sends stored
     CRM and billing information. At 4352, the service controller is in a
     device online state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0369] FIGS. 44A through 44B are flow diagrams illustrating a flow diagram
     for a service processor activation sequence as shown in FIG. 44A and a
     flow diagram for a service controller activation sequence as shown in
     FIG. 44B in accordance with some embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0370] Referring to FIG. 44A, at 4402, a service processor activation
     sequence is initiated. At 4404, the service processor (e.g., service
     processor 115) of the device displays an activation site (e.g., HTTP
     site, WAP site or portal) to the user for the user's service activation
     choice. At 4406, the user selects service plan, billing information and
     CRM information. At 4408, the service processor sends an activation
     request and user billing and CRM information to, for example, the service
     controller. At 4410, the service processor determines whether there is an
     integrity error. If so, then the service processor performs integrity
     error handling at 4412. Otherwise, the service processor determines
     whether there has been a selection input error at 4414. If so, the
     service processor displays the selection input error to the user at 4416
     and returns to the activation site/portal at 4404. Otherwise, the service
     processor identifies the activated service plan at 4418. At 4420, the
     service processor performs the following: updates critical software,
     initializes service policy and control settings, synchronizes service
     counters, updates service cost data, applies policy settings, applies CRM
     rules settings, obtains transaction identity certificate, and sends
     stored CRM and billing information. At 4422, the device is in an online
     and activated state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0371] Referring to FIG. 44B, at 4432, a service controller activation
     sequence is initiated. At 4434, the service controller (e.g., service
     controller 122) receives an activation request, including user billing
     and CRM information, and sends such to central billing. At 4436, the
     service controller receives a response from central billing. At 4438, the
     service controller verifies the integrity of the service processor. If an
     integrity error is detected, then an integrity error is sent at 4440. At
     4442, the service controller performs integrity error handling. At 4444,
     the service controller determines whether the service plan has been
     activated. If not, then the service controller sends a selection input
     error to the device at 4446 and returns to 4432. Otherwise (device has
     been activated), the service controller sends the service plan activation
     information to the device at 4448. At 4450, the service controller
     performs the following: updates critical software, initializes service
     policy and control settings, synchronizes service counters, updates
     service cost data, applies policy settings, applies CRM rules settings,
     obtains transaction identity certificate, and sends stored CRM and
     billing information. At 4452, the service controller is in a device
     online and activated state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0372] FIGS. 45A through 45B are flow diagrams illustrating a flow diagram
     for a service processor access control sequence as shown in FIG. 45A and
     a flow diagram for a service controller access control sequence as shown
     in FIG. 45B in accordance with some embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0373] Referring to FIG. 45A, at 4502, the device is in an online state.
     At 4504, the service processor (e.g., service processor 115) of the
     device processes any new heartbeat messages received from the service
     controller (e.g., service controller 122). At 4506, the service processor
     updates software if necessary, updates service policy and control
     settings if necessary, synchronizes service counters, updates service
     cost data if necessary, and updates CRM rules if necessary. At 4508, the
     service processor performs access control integrity checks. At 4510, the
     service processor determines whether there are any access control
     integrity errors. If so, then the service processor performs integrity
     error handling at 4512. Otherwise, the service processor updates user
     service UI gauges, provides notification if necessary, and accepts input
     if available at 4514. At 4516, the service processor sends new service
     processor heartbeat messages to the heartbeat message queue. At 4518, the
     service processor processes any pending billing transactions. At 4520,
     the service processor determines if a heartbeat transmission is due, and
     if not, returns to 4504 for processing any received heartbeat messages.
     If so, at 4522, the service processor sends the new service processor
     heartbeat message to the service controller.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0374] Referring to FIG. 45B, at 4532, the device is in an online state.
     At 4534, the service controller (e.g., service controller 122) processes
     any new heartbeat messages received from the service processor. At 4536,
     the service controller performs access control integrity checks. At 4538,
     the service controller determines whether there are any access control
     integrity errors. If so, then the service controller performs integrity
     error handling at 4540. At 4542, the service controller updates the
     billing database, updates the CRM information, synchronizes service
     counters, updates cost database if needed, and synchronizes CRM rules if
     necessary. At 4544, the service controller processes any pending billing
     transactions. At 4546, the service controller sends new service processor
     heartbeat messages to the heartbeat message queue. At 4548, the service
     controller determines if a heartbeat transmission is due, and if not,
     returns to 4534 for processing any received heartbeat messages. If so, at
     4550, the service controller sends new service processor heartbeat
     message to the service processor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Open Content Distribution and Transaction System
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0375] Referring now to FIGS. 46 and 47A-47B, in another set of
     embodiments an open, decentralized, device based system for enabling
     central billing for third party electronic commerce transactions for
     mobile commerce is provided as shown. For example, in these embodiments,
     device information can be embedded in HTTP, WAP or other portal
     browser/network header request information that indicates a central
     billing option is available to a compatible third party transaction
     server, as further described below with respect to FIGS. 46 and 47A-47B.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0376] FIG. 46 is a functional diagram illustrating open, decentralized,
     device based mobile commerce transactions in accordance with some
     embodiments. As shown, a service processor 4615 of the device 100 (e.g.,
     any mobile device capable of storing and executing the service processor
     4615) includes access control integrity agent 1694, billing agent 1695,
     agent communication bus 1630, user interface 1697, policy control agent
     1692, service monitor agent 1696, application interface agent 1693,
     policy implementation agent 1690, and modem router and firewall 1655, as
     similarly described herein with respect to various other service
     processor embodiments. In some embodiments, an application 4604 (e.g., an
     HTML/WAP web browser) and a mobile payment agent 4699 are also included
     in the device, such as part of the service processor 4615 as shown. In
     some embodiments, the application 4604 is not integrated as part of the
     service processor 4615, but is executing and/or stored on the device. In
     some embodiments, the mobile payment agent 4699 includes billing agent
     1695, user interface 1697 and/or application interface agent 1693, and/or
     various other functional components/agents. As shown, the service
     processor 4615 is in communication with a carrier access network 4610,
     which is in network communication with the Internet 120.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0377] In some embodiments, device information can be embedded in HTTP,
     WAP or other portal browser/network header request information that
     indicates a central billing option is available to a compatible third
     party transaction server, such as the open content transaction partner
     site(s) 134. For example, the compatible transaction server can then send
     a signed confirmation request over a pre-assigned control socket channel
     to the billing agent 1695 with the billing agent 1695 confirming the
     signed confirmation request by either performing the signature check
     locally based on a stored and synchronized list of approved transaction
     servers or by passing the signed request onto a billing server 4630 for
     confirmation. Optionally, in another example, a triangle confirmation can
     be set up in which the billing server 4630 can confirm the transaction
     set up with the transaction server 134 or the transaction server 134 can
     confirm the transaction set up with the billing server 4630. Once the
     device confirms the compatible and approved status of the transaction
     server 134, the device/transaction server pair can then optionally
     further exchange keys for the remainder of the transaction for enhanced
     security. In another example, the transaction server 134 can also
     redirect the user browsing experience to one tailored to one or more of
     device type, service provider, device manufacturer or user. When the user
     selects a transaction, the transaction server sends the billing agent
     1695 a transaction bill that describes the transaction and the amount.
     The billing agent 1695 can optionally confirm that the user account has
     sufficient credit limit to make the purchase by either confirming the
     stored credit limit on the device or querying the billing server 4630.
     The billing agent 1695 then invokes the device UI 1697 to display the
     transaction description and amount and request user approval for the
     billing to be conducted through the central billing option. User approval
     can be acquired, for example, by a simple click operation or require a
     secure password, key and/or biometric response from the user. Upon user
     approval, the billing agent 1695 generates a billing approval and sends
     it to the transaction server 134, the transaction server 134 completes
     the transaction and then sends a bill to the billing agent 1695. The
     billing agent 1695 optionally sends a confirmation to the transaction
     server 134 and sends the bill to the billing server 4630. Again,
     optionally a triangle confirmation can be formed by the billing server
     sending a confirmation to the transaction server 134, or the transaction
     server 134 can send the bill to the billing server 4630. In some
     embodiments, the billing server 4630 can also communication such billed
     transactions to a central provider billing system 4623 via the carrier
     access network 4610. Also, in some embodiments, an alternate location
     billing server 4632 is in communication via the Internet 120, and an
     alternate location central provider billing system 4625 is also in
     communication via the Internet 120.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0378] FIGS. 47A through 47B are transactional diagrams illustrating open,
     decentralized, device based mobile commerce transactions in accordance
     with some embodiments. Referring to FIG. 47A, the device application 4604
     browses (e.g., based on the user submitting a browse request using a
     browser application) to transaction server 134 (e.g., a transaction web
     server, such as the open content transaction partner site 134). The
     transaction server 134 provides an offer to the device application 4604.
     The device application 4604 selects a purchase (e.g., based on the user's
     selection input). In response, the transaction server 134 seeks an API
     connection with the device mobile payment agent 4699, which then confirms
     the API connection. The transaction server 134 requests user purchase
     confirmation (mediated by the device mobile agent 4699 as shown), and the
     purchase is confirmed by the device application 4604 (e.g., based on the
     user's acknowledgement as similarly described above with respect to FIG.
     46). The transaction server 134 then transmits a purchase receipt, and
     the device application 4604 confirms the receipt. The transaction server
     134 then transmits the purchase bill to the device mobile payment agent
     4699, which then sends the purchase bill to the device billing server
     (e.g., billing server 4630). The transaction server also optionally sends
     a confirmation of the purchase bill to the device billing server for a
     triangle confirmation, as similarly described above with respect to FIG.
     46. The device billing server sends a copy of the purchase bill to the
     central provider billing system (e.g., central provider billing system
     4623).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0379] Referring now to FIG. 47B, the device application 4604 browses
     (e.g., based on the user submitting a browse request using a browser
     application) to transaction server 134 (e.g., a transaction web server,
     such as the open content transaction partner site 134), in which the
     browse request includes device ID information, such as similarly
     described above with respect to FIG. 46. The transaction server 134
     establishes API contact with the device mobile agent 4699, which then
     confirms contact and good standing for transactional purchases from the
     device. The transaction server 134 provides an offer to the device
     application 4604. The device application 4604 selects a purchase (e.g.,
     based on the user's selection input). The transaction server 134 notifies
     the device mobile payment agent 4699 of the purchase description and
     amount, and the device mobile payment agent 4699 then requests user
     purchase confirmation. The purchase is confirmed by the device
     application 4604 (e.g., based on the user's acknowledgement as similarly
     described above with respect to FIG. 46), and the device mobile payment
     agent 4699 then transmits a purchase confirmation to the transaction
     server 134. The transaction server 134 then transmits a purchase receipt,
     and the device application 4604 confirms the receipt. The transaction
     server 134 then transmits the purchase bill to the device mobile payment
     agent 4699, which then sends the purchase bill to the device billing
     server (e.g., billing server 4630). The transaction server also
     optionally sends a confirmation of the purchase bill to the device
     billing server for a triangle confirmation, as similarly described above
     with respect to FIG. 46. The device billing server sends the purchase
     bill to the central provider billing system (e.g., central provider
     billing system 4623). In some embodiments, the communications described
     above with respect to FIGS. 47A-47B with the billing server and the
     central provider billing system are with the alternate location billing
     server 4632 and/or alternate location central provider billing system
     4625 via the Internet 120. Similarly, in some embodiments, the
     transaction servers 134 are connected to the Internet 120.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0380] Accordingly, these transaction billing embodiments do not require
     centralized content storage or content and transaction exchange
     infrastructure. For example, the transactions can be conducted over the
     Internet, and the user experience and content can be tailored versions of
     the transaction server/content provider's normal experience and content.
     This approach provides for a much wider array of content and transaction
     partners with minimal or no need to accommodate proprietary specialized
     systems. Moreover, the compatibility between the device billing agent
     transaction system and the transaction provider server is easily
     established, for example, by writing specifications for the header
     information transmitted by the device and for the secure handshake and
     signed message transactions that take place between the device billing
     agent, the transaction server and optionally the transaction server and
     the billing server. Once a transaction partner shows compatibility test
     results and concludes a business relationship with the service provider,
     the service provider can place the transaction partner on the compatible
     and approved list and exchange security keys and/or certificates. If a
     common user experience is desired by the service provider across multiple
     transaction partners, then the experience specifications for the browser
     redirects can also be specified in the compatibility specification and
     tested before the transaction partner gains approval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Design and Testing for Service Control
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0381] FIG. 48 illustrates a network architecture including a service
     controller device control system and a service controller analysis and
     management system in accordance with some embodiments. As described
     herein, the RAN gateway 410 generally represents the functionality of the
     various specific RAN gateway functional elements shown and/or discussed
     herein. For example, these RAN gateway 410 functional elements represent
     the gateways used to aggregate the radio access network traffic, control,
     charging and roaming functions and/or other functions and are shown
     and/or discussed herein using other terminology specific to certain
     industry standards, including SGSN gateway 410 and gateways 508, 512,
     608, 612, 708 and 712. Although the same reference numerals are used for
     SGSN gateway 410 and RAN gateway 410, it will be appreciated that the RAN
     gateway 410 represents any or all of the RAN gateway functional elements
     410, 508, 512, 608, 612, 708, 712 or any other similar industry equipment
     or functions depending on the embodiment. Similarly, transport gateway
     420 represents the next higher level of gateway aggregation for the
     transport layer that is used in many networks, and this term transport
     gateway 420 can be interchanged with any or all of the gateways 420, 520,
     620, 720 or any other similar industry equipment or functions depending
     on the embodiment. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
     which gateway description applies to a respective embodiment in which the
     terms RAN gateway 410, gateway 410, transport gateway 420 or gateway 420
     are referenced herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0382] While the embodiments described below with respect to FIGS. 48
     through 63 are depicted in the context of a conventional multi-tier
     access network, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
     such embodiments can also be generalized to other network topologies
     including the various flattened network topologies described herein. As
     shown, the service controller is divided into two main functions (e.g.,
     as compared with the embodiments of service controller 122 depicted in
     FIG. 16): (1) a service controller device control system 4825 and (2) a
     service controller design, policy analysis, definition, test, publishing
     system 4835. The service controller device control system 4825 performs
     the device service control channel functions as previously described
     herein with respect to various embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0383] The service controller design, policy analysis, definition, test,
     publishing system 4835 separates out the service analysis, control policy
     design and publishing from the device service control channel functions.
     The service controller design, policy analysis, definition, test,
     publishing system 4835 performs a variety of functions as described
     below. In some embodiments, the service controller design, policy
     analysis, definition, test, publishing system 4835 provides service usage
     statistical analysis, notification policy or procedure response analysis
     and/or billing policy or procedure response analysis for single devices,
     groups of devices, types of devices, groups of users, classes of users,
     or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service.
     In some embodiments, the service controller design, policy analysis,
     definition, test, publishing system 4835 detects, singles out and reports
     device service usage, notification responses or billing behavior that is
     outside of expected limits but may or may not be violating policy. In
     some embodiments, the service controller design, policy analysis,
     definition, test, publishing system 4835 provides service cost and
     profitability analysis for single devices, groups of devices, types of
     devices, groups of users, classes of users, or an entire set of devices
     and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments, the
     service controller design, policy analysis, definition, test, publishing
     system 4835 provides user service control policy, notification policy or
     billing policy statistical satisfaction analysis for single devices,
     groups of devices, types of devices, groups of users, classes of users,
     or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service.
     In some embodiments, the service controller design, policy analysis,
     definition, test, publishing system 4835 provides statistical take rate
     analysis for transaction offers and billing offers for single devices,
     groups of devices, types of devices, groups of users, classes of users,
     or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0384] In some embodiments, the service controller design, policy
     analysis, definition, test, publishing system 4835 provides service
     control policy definition work screens and "dry-lab" (pre-beta) testing
     against usage database for single devices, groups of devices, types of
     devices, groups of users, classes of users, or an entire set of devices
     and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments, the
     service controller design, policy analysis, definition, test, publishing
     system 4835 provides service control policy, notification policy and/or
     billing policy beta testing (e.g., using beta test server 1658) in which
     the beta test profile is published to a subset of users or devices. In
     some embodiments, beta devices/users may or may not know that the service
     policy is being tested with them. In some embodiments, if they do know,
     then beta test apparatus includes offering system that provides user
     options to accept beta test and provide feedback in exchange for an offer
     (e.g., show them an offer page that comes up with their existing
     subscription service or ambient service--offer a free trial, a discount
     to something and/or reward zone points (or other incentives/rewards) if
     they accept the trial). In some embodiments, a beta test workstation
     (e.g., in communication with the beta test server 1658, such as VSP
     remote workstation 4920 as shown in FIG. 49) allows the beta test manager
     to define one or more beta test service policy, notification policy
     and/or billing policy control profiles. In some embodiments, the beta
     test workstation publishes each profile to specific individual (single)
     devices, groups of devices, types of devices, groups of users, classes of
     users, or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given
     service. In some embodiments, the beta test workstation allows the beta
     test manager to analyze usage statistics, notification response
     statistics and/or billing/transaction offer response statistics for
     devices, users, groups of devices or groups of users and compare actual
     real-time usage versus beta test usage goals. In some embodiments, the
     beta test workstation allows the beta test manager to fine tune service,
     notification and/or billing/transaction policies and re-publish to
     observe changes to actual service usage until the service policy and/or
     notification control policies achieve the desired result. In some
     embodiments, the beta test workstation also allows the beta test manager
     to collect direct user feedback to a set of pre-designed user
     satisfaction or other questions regarding service usage. For example,
     questions can be presented through a pre-designed beta test portal or
     through a series of brief pop-ups that come up when the user initiates a
     particular action or at a particular time. In some embodiments, the beta
     test workstation also collects details of service and device usage (e.g.,
     CRM data) that the beta test users have approved for collection. In some
     embodiments, the beta test workstation can decompose this data to
     determine if the users are using the service in the manner intended by
     the beta test goals. In some embodiments, the beta test workstation also
     allows for publishing multiple variants of the service and/or
     notification policy control settings and compare the service usage for
     each group with convenient screens with information displays (e.g.,
     statistical usage versus time of day, usage of particular activities,
     billing activity, device discovery activity, user response to
     notification message and options, user satisfaction with a particular
     notification policy or billing policy or traffic control policy). In some
     embodiments, the screens can be designed by the beta test manager.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0385] In some embodiments, once a service is completely tested and
     approved for production publication, the service download control server
     1660 has a workstation screen that allows the service manager to specify
     which group of devices are to receive the new service policy
     configuration. In some embodiments, the service download control server
     1660 allows the service manager to define specific individual (single)
     devices, groups of devices, types of devices, groups of users, classes of
     users, or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given
     service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0386] In some embodiments, a service (e.g., a newly created or new
     version of an existing service) is tested and/or enhanced using a new
     service testing model. For example, a new service (or a new version of an
     existing service) is loaded onto a server for testing, the new service is
     (optionally) tested against existing device usage statistics, a new
     service control definition (e.g., implemented as service processor 115
     for publishing to devices 100 and a corresponding new service controller
     122 for the service provider, such as a central provider or an MVNO
     partner, and, for example, the new service processor and service
     controller can be implemented using the below described SDK) for the new
     service is developed and possibly adjusted based on the testing against
     existing device usage statistics, the new service control definition is
     then published to beta devices (e.g., various devices 100 used for beta
     testing the new service), which then use the new service, service usage
     statistics and/or user feedback statistics are then collected (e.g., to
     ensure that the service is functioning properly and so that the service
     control definition can be tuned to ensure adequate service, user
     experience and for service pricing/profitability purposes), the
     service/service control definition is then fine tuned based on the
     service usage/user feedback statistics. Upon completion of the above
     testing and refinement of the service/service control definition, the
     service control definition can be published to specified groups of
     devices for using the new service. In some embodiments, this service
     control testing model for groups of devices and service partners is
     provided by a virtual MVNO or VSP. For example, this allows for new
     services to be more efficiently and more effectively developed, tested
     and proliferated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0387] In some embodiments, service history IPDRs come from within a
     networking component connected to the central provider core network 110
     as depicted by (e.g., real-time) service usage 118 (which as discussed
     elsewhere is a general purpose descriptor for a function located in one
     or more of the networking equipment boxes). In some embodiments, service
     history IPDRs are collected/aggregated (in part) from the central billing
     system 123. In some embodiments, service history IPDRs are
     collected/aggregated (in part) from the transport gateways 420. In some
     embodiments, service history IPDRs are collected/aggregated (in part)
     from the RAN gateways 410. In some embodiments, service history IPDRs are
     collected/aggregated (in part) from the base station(s) 125 or a
     networking component co-located with the base station(s) 125, a
     networking component in the transport network 415, a networking component
     in the core network 110 or from another source.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Virtual Service Provider for Service Control
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0388] In some embodiments, virtual service provider (VSP) capabilities
     include making available to a third party service partner one or more of
     the following: (1) device group definition, control and security, (2)
     provisioning definition and execution, (3) ATS activation owner, (4)
     service profile definitions, (5) activation and ambient service
     definition, (6) billing rules definition, (7) billing process and
     branding controls, (8) bill by account settings, (9) service usage
     analysis capabilities by device, sub-group or group, (10) beta test
     publishing capabilities by device, sub-group or group, and (11)
     production publishing, fine tuning and re-publishing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0389] FIG. 49 illustrates a network architecture for an open developer
     platform for virtual service provider (VSP) partitioning in accordance
     with some embodiments. As shown, the service controller design, policy
     analysis, definition, test, publishing system 4835 is configured so that
     multiple "service group owners" (e.g., the service provider for certain
     smart phones) or "device group owners" (e.g., eReader devices for the
     eReader service provider(s)) or "user group owners" (e.g., IT for Company
     X for their employees' corporate mobile devices), collectively referred
     to as the "Virtual Service Provider" (VSP), are serviced with the same
     service controller infrastructure and the same (or substantially similar)
     service processor design from virtual service provider workstation server
     4910 and/or virtual service provider remote workstation(s) 4920. As
     shown, the virtual service provider remote workstation(s) 4920
     communicates with the virtual service provider workstation server 4910
     via VPN, leased line or secure Internet connections. The dashed lines
     shown in FIG. 49 are depicted to represent that, in some embodiments, the
     virtual service provider workstation server 4910 is networked with the
     service controller device control system 4825 and/or, in some
     embodiments, the service controller design, policy analysis, definition,
     test, publishing system 4835. Based on the discussion herein, it will be
     apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the VSP workstation
     server 4910 can also be networked in various embodiments with billing
     system 123, AAA server 121, gateways 410 or 420, or other network
     components to perform, for example, various network provisioning and
     activation related functions discussed herein for the device group
     assigned to one or more VSPs, or for other reasons as will be apparent to
     a given VSP embodiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0390] In some embodiments, the service controller functionality is
     partitioned for a VSP by setting up one or more secure workstations,
     secure portals, secure websites, secure remote software terminals and/or
     other similar techniques to allow the service managers who work for the
     VSP to analyze, fine tune, control or define the services they decide to
     publish to one or more groups of devices or groups of users that the VSP
     "owns," In some embodiments, the VSP "owns" such groups by virtue of a
     relationship with the central provider in which the VSP is responsible
     for the service design and profitability. In some embodiments, the
     central provider receives payment from the VSP for wholesale access
     services. In some embodiments, the VSP workstations 4910 and 4920 only
     have access to the service analysis, design, beta testing and publishing
     functions for the devices or users "owned" by the VSP. In some
     embodiments, the user or device base serviced by the central provider
     network is securely partitioned into those owned by the central provider,
     those owned by the VSP, and those owned by any other VSPs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0391] In some embodiments, the VSP manages their devices from the VSP
     workstations 4910 and 4920 using device based service control techniques
     as described herein. In some embodiments, the VSP manages their devices
     from the VSP workstations 4910 and 4920 using device assisted and network
     based service control techniques as described herein. In some
     embodiments, the VSP manages their devices from the VSP workstations 4910
     and 4920 using network based service control techniques (e.g., DPI
     techniques) as described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0392] For example, this approach is particularly well suited for "open
     developer programs" offered by the central providers in which the central
     provider brings in VSPs who offer special value in the devices or service
     plans, and using this approach, neither the central provider nor the VSP
     needs to do as much work as would be required to set up a conventional
     MVNO or MVNE system, which often requires some degree of customization in
     the network solution, the billing solution or the device solution for
     each new device application and/or service application that is developed
     and deployed. In some embodiments, the service customization is
     simplified by implementing custom policy settings on the service
     processor and service controller, and the custom device is quickly
     brought onto the network using the SDK and test/certification process. In
     some embodiments, the VSP functionality is also offered by an entity
     other than the central provider. For example, an MVNE entity can develop
     a wholesale relationship with one or more carriers, use the service
     controller to create the VSP capabilities, and then offer VSP services
     for one network or for a group of networks. In some embodiments, the
     service customization is simplified by implementing custom policy
     settings through the VSP embodiments on the network equipment, including,
     in some embodiments, service aware or DPI based network equipment that
     has a relatively deep level of service activity control capability. For
     example, using the embodiments described herein, and possibly also
     including some of the activation and provisioning embodiments, it is
     possible to efficiently design and implement custom ambient service plans
     that are different for different types of devices, different OEMs,
     different VSPs, different distributors, or different user groups all
     using the same general infrastructure, whether the service control policy
     implementation is accomplished primarily (or exclusively) with networking
     equipment (network) based service control, primarily (or exclusively)
     with device based service control or with a combination of both (e.g.,
     hybrid device and network based service control).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0393] As discussed herein, various VSP embodiments for performing one or
     more of analyzing traffic usage and defining, managing service profiles
     or plans, dry lab testing service profiles or plans, beta testing service
     profiles or plans, fine tuning service profiles or plans, publishing
     service profiles or plans, or other policy related settings can involve
     programming settings in the network equipment and/or programming settings
     or software on the device. For example, as discussed herein, the service
     processor settings are controlled by the service controller, which can be
     partitioned to allow groups of devices to be controlled. As another
     example, equipment in the network involved with network based service
     control, such as DPI based gateways, routers or switches, can similarly
     be programmed to utilize various VSP embodiments to implement that
     portion of the service profile (or service activity usage control) that
     is controlled by network level functions, and it will be appreciated that
     substantially all or all of the service activity control for certain
     embodiments can be accomplished with the network functions instead of the
     device. Continuing this example, just as the device service processor
     settings control functions of the service processor can have a group of
     devices that are partitioned off and placed under the control of a VSP,
     various VSP control embodiments can partition off a group of devices that
     have service usage activity controlled by the networking equipment,
     including, in some embodiments, sophisticated service aware DPI based
     service control equipment, to achieve similar objectives. It will be
     appreciated that the discussion herein regarding service controller
     design, policy analysis, test, publishing 4835, and the discussion
     regarding device group, user group and other VSP related embodiments,
     should be understood as applicable to various embodiments described in
     view of device based services control, control assistance and/or
     monitoring, or network based services control, control assistance and/or
     monitoring, or a combination of device based services control, control
     assistance and/or monitoring and network based services control, control
     assistance and/or monitoring. The various embodiments described herein
     related to service activation and provisioning also make apparent how the
     programming of network equipment service control, service control
     assistance and/or monitoring can be implemented prior to and following
     activation of the device. It will also be appreciated that the VSP
     capabilities described herein can also be applied to those devices that
     have services controlled by, provided by and/or billed by the central
     provider, so these techniques can be applied to central provider service
     embodiments, MVNO embodiments and other embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Open Development System for Access Services--SDK
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0394] In some embodiments, an SDK is provided that allows developers,
     such as device manufacturers, service providers, MVNO, MVNE and/or VSPs,
     to develop various service processors (e.g., different versions of the
     service processor 115) for various devices (e.g., various types of
     devices 100) and corresponding service controllers (e.g., different
     versions of the service controller 122) for various types of services and
     network environments. For example, a device manufacturer can use the SDK
     to develop a new service processor for their new device (e.g., mobile
     phone, PDA, eBook reader, portable music device, computer, laptop,
     netbook, or any other network accessible device). The device manufacturer
     can also preload/preinstall their new service processor on their new
     devices. In this example, users of the new device would then be able to
     utilize the new device to access network based services using the new
     service processor, which communicates with the deployed new service
     controller, as similarly discussed herein in various embodiments. For
     example, the device can be preinstalled with the new service processor to
     provide ambient services, as similarly discussed herein in various
     embodiments. For example, the SDK can allow for substantially similar
     service processors to be installed on similar and/or different devices
     thereby minimizing any unnecessary differences between service processor
     elements for device assisted services. In some embodiments, for ambient
     services for a group of devices, or devices associated with a certain
     service provider, a set of numbers (e.g., dummy numbers) can be assigned
     for use for attempting access via the access network using a new device
     that is not yet otherwise subscribed for service. In some embodiments,
     the set of (dummy) numbers used for ambient access by the device can also
     be used for associate of the device with a service provider or a type of
     device (e.g., eReader or some other type of network accessible device),
     and upon activation, the service provider assigns a real number for the
     activated device (e.g., which can be provided at the time of manufacture
     of the device, point of sale of the device, or after the point of sale of
     the device, such as upon activation of the device). For example, ambient
     access of the device can use the device ID, SIM ID, assigned phone (real
     or dummy) number, and/or other information associated with the device for
     assigning appropriate service control and service policy/profile for the
     device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0395] In some embodiments, the service processor 115 is distributed as an
     SDK to any device that the central provider or the VSP desires to offer
     services with so that the service processor 115 can be efficiently
     designed or adapted by the device OEM, ODM or manufacturer for operation
     on the service network. In some embodiments, the SDK includes either a
     complete set of service processor 115 agent software designed for and/or
     tested for the OS (Operating System) and processor set being used on the
     device, or a mature reference design for the OS and processor set being
     used on the device, or a less mature reference design (potentially for
     the same OS and/or processor set or a different OS and/or processor set
     being used on the device) that the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)
     ports to the desired OS or processor set, or a basic set of example
     software programs that the OEM or ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) can
     use to develop software compatible with the service, or a set of
     specifications and descriptions (possibly forming an interoperability
     standard) of how to design the software to be compatible with the
     service. In some embodiments, the SDK includes a set of OEM lab test
     procedures and/or test criteria to ensure that the implementation of the
     service SDK is compatible with the service and will operate properly. In
     some embodiments, the SDK includes a set of network certification test
     procedures and/or test criteria to ensure that the implementation of the
     service SDK is compatible with the service and will operate properly. In
     some embodiments, the certification procedures are approved for testing
     by the OEM, the central provider, the VSP and/or a trusted third party.
     For example, the central provider is typically in control of the SDK and
     the test procedures, but others can be in control. In some embodiments,
     the test procedures are at least in part common across multiple central
     provider networks. In some embodiments, the SDK concept is extended to
     include one or more modem modules where one or more of the SDK
     embodiments described above is combined with a standard reference design
     or a standard hardware sales package for one or more modems so that the
     entire package forms a turn-key product that allows a device
     manufacturer, central provider, VSP or other entity bring new devices or
     device applications onto the central provider network possibly in
     combination with other networks in a manner that requires less
     engineering time and resources and less network certification time and
     resources than would be required in some designs that do not use this
     standard SDK plus module approach. For example, the standard SDK plus
     module product embodiments can be pre-certified and tested with one or
     more central providers to further reduce development time and expense.
     The standard SDK plus module embodiments can also use a multi-mode modem
     (e.g., modems based on a multimode CDMA, EVDO, UMTS, HSPA chipset as in
     the Gobi global multimode chipset product or modems based on other
     recently announced LTE plus HSPA chipsets, WiMax plus Wi-Fi chipsets or
     LTE plus EVDO chipsets) and a multi-mode connection manager agent so that
     the same SDK plus modem embodiment may satisfy a wide range of
     applications for many service providers around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0396] In some embodiments, at the time of manufacture, the device is
     associated with an MVNO. For example, the MVNO can provide an ambient
     service that provides a service provider clearing house, in which the
     device can access a network in ambient access mode (e.g., a wholesale
     MVNO connection through the access network) for purposes of selecting a
     service provider (e.g., a VSP, MVNO or carrier). Based on the service
     provider selection, the device credentials and/or service processor are
     reprogrammed and/or new software is downloaded/installed to activate the
     device with the selected service provider, as described herein for
     provisioning the device and the account on that service provider network
     (e.g., the ATS can track such activation, for example, for revenue
     sharing purposes, as an activation incentive fee).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0397] In some embodiments ATS is implemented entirely in the network as
     described below. At the time of manufacture or at sometime during device
     distribution, the device master agent programs a unique credential in the
     device that cannot be re-programmed or removed (or is difficult to
     re-program or remove) and that can be recognized and recorded by the
     network at the time of activation or at some other time. In this manner,
     even if other, possibly primary, device credentials are reprogrammed or
     removed, there will still be a credential that is associated with the
     device master agent. The ATS process can then be implemented by using a
     database search function to scan through the database of activated
     devices to form a list of devices that have been activated for the
     purpose of master agent reconciliation. Example credentials that can
     suffice are MEID, hardware MAC address, and/or serial number, that are
     picked up and recorded by the service provider or other service entity at
     time of activation or before or after activation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interface Server Overlay for Billing/IPDR Feed Mediation
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0398] FIG. 50 illustrates a network architecture including a billing to
     service controller interface for accommodating minimum changes in
     existing central billing, AAA and/or other network components in
     accordance with some embodiments. As shown, the central billing system
     123 includes a mediation, customer service and billing databases,
     historical usage, billing systems component 5010 and a billing to service
     controller interface component 5020. For example, the billing to service
     controller interface component 5020 allows for the central billing system
     123 to efficiently communicate with the service controller (e.g., service
     controller device control system 4825).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0399] In some embodiments, an interface server (e.g., the billing
     databases, historical usage, billing systems component 5010 and/or the
     billing to service controller interface component 5020) is provided that
     reads the IPDRs, service profile and/or service plan information stored
     in the billing and/or service record database(s). In some embodiments,
     the interface server performs these functions in a manner that is
     compatible with communication formats of the billing and/or service
     record database(s) so that little or no changes are required in the
     configuration, communication formats or software of the existing central
     billing, AAA and/or other network components. In some embodiments, the
     interface server (e.g., including the billing databases, historical
     usage, billing systems component 5010 and the billing to service
     controller interface component 5020) is co-located with the central
     billing system components as shown, or in other embodiments, the
     interface server is located elsewhere. For example, the interface server
     can be located close to or within the components that comprise the
     service controller or anywhere else in the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0400] In some embodiments, the interface server performs certain
     communication protocol translation or data format translation required to
     interface the information stored in the billing and/or service record
     database(s) to the service controller functions so that the central
     billing system 123 and other existing components in the network do not
     need to change much (if at all) to enable the service controller and
     service processor to implement device based/assisted service control. In
     some embodiments, the central billing system 123 or other network
     components are not required to be aware of the service control functions
     being implemented by the service controller or service processor, because
     the interface server acquires the network based information needed by the
     service controller and/or service processor while requiring little or no
     specialized awareness, communication, data formatting, user interfacing,
     service profile processing or service plan processing on the part of
     existing billing, database or networking components. In this type of
     overlay approach, various embodiments described herein can be used to
     quickly upgrade the capabilities of existing networks for new devices
     while minimizing the required changes to the existing network that
     supports legacy devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0401] For example, a new ambient service plan can be implemented within
     the central billing system 123 that is associated with a zero or low cost
     billing plan and a usage limit (e.g., ambient service) that may be
     difficult or impossible to support in a manner that would result in high
     user satisfaction and a high level of control for service cost and
     service policy definition. Even if the central billing system 123 is not
     highly involved in the process, the zero or low cost plan can be
     implemented in a manner that results in high user satisfaction and a cost
     controlled service by using the service controller and/or service
     processor and the interface server to implement the ambient services
     access control, service usage control, user interface, service usage
     notification, transaction billing or bill by account functionality. For
     example, this approach can be implemented by reading the service plan
     and/or service policy settings for a device in the central billing
     database using the interface server, looking up the corresponding service
     policy, user notification policy, transaction billing policy and bill by
     account policy associated with the particular service profile or service
     plan, and then implementing the policies with the assistance of the
     service controller and/or service processor. Similarly, in another
     definition, multiple tiers of service control and user notification
     policies can be added to any number of new service profiles or service
     plans that would not otherwise be supported with the central billing
     system 123 and other network components, all with minimal or no
     modifications to the pre-existing network and billing system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0402] Another embodiment calls for receiving a standard IPDR feed from
     central billing 123 or another network component just like an MVNO would.
     For example, the interface server function can be located in the central
     billing system, service processor or elsewhere in the network. This
     provides the IPDR records for service usage policy verification and
     service usage notification synchronization with little or no need to
     modify existing billing or network apparatus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0403] In some embodiments, duplicate the IPDRs are sent from the network
     equipment to the billing system and/or network management system that are
     currently used for generating service billing or are used for device
     management or network management. In some embodiments, duplicate records
     are filtered to send only those records for devices controlled by the
     service controller and/or service processor. For example, this approach
     can provide for the same level of reporting, lower level of reporting,
     and/or higher level of reporting as compared to the reporting required by
     the central billing system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0404] In some embodiments, a bill-by-account billing offset is provided
     using the interface server. For example, bill-by-account billing offset
     information is informed to the billing system through an existing data
     feed and by updating the billing database using the interface server. In
     some embodiments, transaction billing is provided using the interface
     server. For example, transaction billing log information is provided to
     the billing system through an existing data feed and by updating the
     billing database using the interface server.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0405] In some embodiments, existing/new service plan choice screens are
     displayed to the user, a user choice or decision/input is confirmed for a
     selected service plan, and then the service is implemented upon
     confirmation of the billing system update for the new service plan. In
     some embodiments, the service is implemented upon the user selection of a
     new service plan and then retracted if not confirmed as updated by the
     billing system within a certain period of time. In some embodiments, the
     new service plan information is updated in the billing system through an
     existing data feed or by updating the database using the interface
     server.

     some embodiments, in the 4G/3G base station(s) 125 (as indicated by the
     dashed line with the arrow), or alternatively, in the 3G/2G base stations
     125 (as indicated by the dashed line with the arrow).

   <br/>
   Ambient Services
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0409] In some embodiments, improved and simplified processes for
     provisioning a device or user for service on a central provider network,
     an MVNO network or a virtual service provider (VSP) on the central
     provider network are provided. In some embodiments, provisioning includes
     one or more of the following: a process or result of assigning,
     programming, storing or embedding into the device and/or network a set of
     credentials, or otherwise providing the credentials to the user; the
     credentials being at least in part carried on the device or with the
     user; and/or at least a portion of or a counterpart to the credentials
     being stored or recognized by the network so that the various network
     elements responsible for admitting the device access to the appropriate
     service activities do so once the device or user service is active.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0410] As an example, as discussed herein, the credentials can include one
     or more of the following: phone number, device identification number,
     MEID or similar mobile device identifier, hardware security device ID,
     security signature or other security credentials, device serial number,
     device identification and/or credential information via security hardware
     such as a SIM, one or more IP addresses, one or more MAC addresses, any
     other network address identifier, embedded device descriptive information
     block (static or programmable), security key, security signature
     algorithms, passwords or other secure authorization information, service
     processor (or similar device client or agent software) identifier or
     settings or version, device type identifier, browser (e.g., http, https,
     WAP, other browser client) header information or similar identifier,
     browser token information or similar identifier, browser cookie
     information or similar identifier, embedded browser instructions,
     portal-client (e.g., interface or communication agent that connects to a
     network portal used at least in part for provisioning or activation for
     the device or by the user) header information or similar identifier,
     portal-client token information or similar identifier, portal-client
     cookie information or similar identifier, embedded portal-client
     instructions, service provider, OEM, master agent (service distributor),
     VSP, device service owner identifier, distributor or master agent, and/or
     any information the network can use to authorize network admission,
     provision the device, provision the network, activate service, authorize,
     associate or enable the device with a provisioning sequence, associate or
     enable the device with one or more service profiles, associate or assist
     the device with an activation sequence, associate or enable the device
     with an ambient profile or service experience, associate or enable the
     device with one or more service plans or service capabilities, associate
     the device with a service provider or service owner, associate the device
     with an OEM or master agent, associate the device with a distributor or
     master agent, or associate the device with a device group, user group or
     user.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0411] In some embodiments, provisioning includes assigning, programming
     or embedding into the device and/or network the information to define the
     level of service activity, referred to as a service profile, that the
     device is authorized to receive. In some embodiments, provisioning also
     includes establishing the device settings and/or network settings to
     define an ambient activation experience in which the device user receives
     a set of services after (e.g., within a short period of time after)
     purchasing or otherwise obtaining or installing the device whether the
     device has or has not been registered and activated with the device user
     or device owner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0412] In some embodiments, the ambient experience is the user experience
     that is available at the time the device is sold in the event the user
     has not yet signed up for a service plan. For example, the ambient
     experience is defined by an ambient service profile, an ambient service
     plan and/or the other service usage activity control policies in effect
     in the network, on the device, or a combination of both. For example, if
     the device service processor is used in large part to define the ambient
     service profile, then the initial provisioning and activation settings in
     the service processor, and possibly the service controller, can define
     the user service upgrade offering choices, network destination access
     control possibilities, traffic control policies, mobile commerce
     transaction capabilities (e.g., which transaction websites, WAP sites or
     portals the user can access to purchase information, content, music,
     games and/or eBooks), possibly free news or weather or other modest
     bandwidth Internet services that are provided free of charge to entice
     the user into using/upgrading the service or using the transactions or
     viewing advertisements, what advertisements are displayed to the user or
     what advertisement based websites the user is exposed to, certain
     applications may have access while others are blocked (e.g., Internet
     based text services have access but email downloads do not), or other
     example service capabilities. It will be apparent to one of ordinary
     skill in the art that allowing all of these services, and blocking other
     ambient user service attempts (e.g., unpaid large file size Internet
     downloads or uploads or movie viewing or other access that would consume
     bandwidth and cause the ambient service to be a potential source of
     losses for the service provider) is made possible by the service profile
     control capabilities of the service processor and/or the service
     controller. The bill by account embodiments, as discussed herein, in
     which each service activity can, for example, be separately tracked with
     the service monitor and other agents and server functions to produce a
     billing offset that allows categorization and mediation of different
     billing entities (accounts) provides the capability for the service
     provider to individually account for the costs of each ambient service
     element. This allows business models wherein the free access to the end
     user is paid for or partially paid for by one or more service provider
     partners who are billed for service access using the bill by account
     capabilities (e.g., the transaction partners pay for user access to their
     transaction experience and perhaps pay a revenue share for transaction
     billing, the advertising sponsored website partners pay for their access
     service share).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0413] While the service control capabilities of the service processor and
     the bill by account service cost sharing and transaction revenue sharing
     in some cases can create a profitable ambient business model, in other
     cases, the ambient services can be a potential source of losses for the
     service provider. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ambient service
     capabilities can be modified over time to reduce service cost to the
     service provider or VSP based on a variety of decision factors. For
     example, the user can have one level of traffic control for a period of
     time, and if the user has not signed up for service by the end of the
     period, the ambient service access is reduced by changing the service
     control policy settings in the service processor, and the service level
     can be further reduced over time if the user continues to not sign up for
     service or the user does not create much transaction revenue. As another
     example, the recursive throttling algorithms discussed herein can be
     utilized to one or more of the service activities offered in ambient
     service mode so that the user experiences what full speed service is
     like, and if the user continues consuming appreciable bandwidth with the
     service activity, then the activity is throttled back to reduce costs. In
     these examples, the service processor or service controller can issue the
     user a notification explaining that their service is currently free so
     their usage is being throttled, and if they desire to receive better
     service, service plan upgrade offers can be delivered to the UI. It will
     now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various
     ambient service parameters, including the provisioning and activation
     processes used to create the ambient service activation, can also be
     managed by the VSP apparatus and processes described herein. For example,
     this allows the same service controllers and service processor solutions
     to be used to define a wide range of ambient experiences for various
     device groups or user groups that are controlled by different VSPs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0414] Similarly, rather than controlling the ambient service profile
     settings using the VSP functions to control the service controller,
     service processor, provisioning and activation settings, other
     embodiments call for the ambient service profile settings to be
     controlled by the network based service activity control equipment as
     similarly discussed herein. Depending on the level of service control and
     service monitoring sophistication (e.g., highly advanced DPI or service
     aware techniques), some, much, most or all of the above described ambient
     services functionality can be implemented using network based service
     controls and the VSP management and control embodiments described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0415] In some embodiments, a device is suspended based on inactivity, or
     the device is placed in a suspended service state or suspended account
     state, so that the network does not get bogged down with a significant
     number of devices and credentials that are inactive. For example, this
     can also result in a portion of the device credentials being assigned
     back to an available pool rather than reserved for that particular device
     (e.g., phone numbers if phone numbers are scarce). The device account
     and/or activation state can be re-activated when the device comes back
     online. For example, the suspend state can be a simple suspension of
     services without changing the account status, in which case the
     re-activation process can be automatically completed as a subset or
     entire set of the activation sequence that occurs when the device is
     initially used as described herein. The suspend state can also involve
     changing the account status to inactive, in which case the re-activation
     process can automatically reconfigure the account status back to an
     active state when the device re-accesses the network. For example, the
     suspend state can involve de-assigning or possibly re-claiming a portion
     of the device credentials. If a portion of the credentials are
     de-assigned, then when the device re-accesses the network credentials can
     be automatically re-assigned as described in various embodiments
     described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Network Based Service Monitoring, Notification and Control
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0416] In some embodiments, as described herein, it is desirable to
     implement some or all of the deep service usage monitoring, service
     control or control assistance, or service notification or notification
     assistance associated with a service profile in network apparatus rather
     than in the device, or to implement some of the deep service monitoring,
     control, control assistance, notification or notification assistance in
     the device and others in the network. This is the case, for example, in a
     mixed network in which some devices have some, or at least one, or all of
     the service processor capabilities discussed herein, but other devices do
     not have as much or any of the service processor capabilities. Another
     example is for networks or devices that do not have any service processor
     capabilities or where it is desirable to do all of the service
     monitoring, control and notification in the network rather than the
     device. As described below, FIGS. 54 through 63 depict various
     embodiments for combinations of device based service monitoring, control
     or control assistance, usage notification or usage notification
     assistance and/or network based service monitoring, control or control
     assistance, usage notification or usage notification assistance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0417] FIG. 54 illustrates a network architecture for locating service
     controller device control functions with AAA and network service usage
     including deep packet inspection functions in accordance with some
     embodiments. As shown, an integrated device service control, device usage
     monitoring system 5410 is provided that integrates service controller
     functions including a deep packet control (DPC) policy implementation
     function 5402 with access network AAA server 121 functions and network
     real-time service usage 118 functions. In the following discussion, it is
     understood that the AAA server 121 function can be re-located to another
     point in the network or network equipment partitioning with no loss in
     generality. It is also understood that many of the functional partitions
     described for the various embodiments within integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 can be re-drawn with no loss
     in applicability, function or generality. Finally, it is understood that
     one or more of the functional elements described within the integrated
     device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410 can be
     removed for simplified embodiments and that not all the functionality
     described herein is necessary in some embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0418] In some embodiments, the integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 provides for network based service
     monitoring or control that satisfies various network neutrality and/or
     privacy requirements based on indication(s) received from the device or
     user (e.g., user input provided using the device UI using the service
     processor 115; user input provided through another website, WAP site or
     portal; or user input provided through the service contract where the
     user agrees to the monitoring and/or service control levels) and network
     based service control using a DPI service monitor 5412 and/or the DPC
     policy implementation 5402.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0419] In some embodiments, the integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 provides for network based service
     monitoring or service control that satisfies various privacy requirements
     using indication(s) received from the device or user (e.g., user input
     provided using the device UI using the service processor 115; user input
     provided through another website, WAP site or portal; or user input
     provided through the service contract where the user agrees to the
     monitoring and/or service control levels) and network based DPI service
     usage monitoring or DPC policy implementation using the DPI service
     monitor 5412 or DPC policy implementation 5402 as described below. In
     some embodiments, the DPI service monitor 5412 and/or DPC policy
     implementation 5402 include a secure database for storing service
     monitoring and CRM information for each device/device user. In some
     embodiments, the DPI service monitor 5412 and/or DPC policy
     implementation 5402 can be integrated with the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 (as shown) or provided
     within a separate router, server, and/or software/hardware implemented
     function that is in secure communication with the integrated device
     service control, device usage monitoring system 5410 and/or other network
     elements based on the network architecture. In some embodiments, a secure
     data store, such as a secure database, is not integrated with the DPI
     service monitor 5412 or DPC policy implementation 5402 but is in secure
     communication with the DPI service monitor 5412 or DPC policy
     implementation 5402, the integrated device service control, device usage
     monitoring system 5410 and/or other network elements depending on the
     architecture (e.g., a billing server or any other network element). In
     some embodiments, the user selects limits and/or restrictions on who can
     access remotely stored service usage history and/or other CRM/privacy
     related data (e.g., CRM/privacy gatekeeper settings), and, for example,
     other network elements and/or network administrators access to such data
     can be limited and/or restricted accordingly. For example, access to such
     stored service monitoring and CRM information can require certain
     security credentials and/or using various other well known secure data
     storage techniques, such as the various secure storage techniques
     described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0420] In some embodiments, the secure database possessing user service
     usage information that is considered sensitive and has not been approved
     for distribution by the user can be made unavailable to the credentials
     possessed by network managers or network functions except, for example,
     for emergency service situations of government mandated monitoring needs
     where special credentials are brought out of secure storage that are not
     normally available. In some embodiments, rather than the user selecting
     limits, a certain set of restrictions are assumed unless the user selects
     information filtering settings that allow more information to be shared
     with the network functions, network administrators or service provider
     partners. In some embodiments, the information is filtered to remove
     information thought to be sensitive but still transmits service usage
     information needed for monitoring network services or other important
     parameters. For example, the website destinations a user is visiting can
     be classified with generic identifiers that are not decodable or the
     individual website information can be completely removed. Many other
     examples will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0421] For example, the stored service monitoring and CRM information can
     also be organized into groups to define group CRM profiles to store
     service monitoring information for every user indexed by the user
     credentials (e.g., such groups can also be used for various VSP related
     functions, as described herein). The DPI service monitor 5412 or DPC
     policy implementation 5402 also uses the secure storage to store service
     monitoring information for each user indexed by the user credentials or
     another aspect of the device identifier or address assignment (e.g., IP
     address or MAC address). In some embodiments, a CRM information manager
     (e.g., a supervisor program executing on the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410) communicates with the other
     network functions and provides filtered service usage and CRM information
     according to CRM filtering rules for each user or for groups of users. In
     some embodiments, the filtered CRM data can be made available using
     secure communications with other networking equipment by the integrated
     device service control, usage monitoring system 5410. In some
     embodiments, the filter settings for some users allow more information to
     be shared from the secure service usage information than others due to
     the differences in user preference settings and/or service plan
     agreements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0422] In some embodiments, user privacy preference information is used to
     determine the privacy filter settings, which are securely implemented by
     the integrated device service control, device usage monitoring system
     5410. For example, service CRM filter settings can be received at the
     time of service contract sign up (e.g., service plan selection) and/or
     allow the user to log into service preferences web page to change
     settings (e.g., without involving any interaction with local software on
     the device). As another example, software on the device (e.g., including
     the service processor 115) can be used for selecting user CRM/privacy
     preferences, which are securely communicated to the integrated device
     service control, device usage monitoring system 5410 (e.g., the device
     can include credentials that can be verified to allow for
     selection/modification of CRM/privacy preferences or other user based
     preferences securely maintained in a network server, such as the
     integrated device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410 or
     another network element, such as shown in various other embodiments
     described herein). In these examples, the filtered CRM data is available
     from the integrated device service control, device usage monitoring
     system 5410 for other network components over a secure or open
     communication link. In another example, user CRM/privacy preferences are
     input using a web server hosted by the integrated device service control,
     device usage monitoring system 5410 or the central billing system 123. In
     another example, software on the device (e.g., including the service
     processor 115) can be used for securely communicating user preference
     decisions to an intermediate server that acts as a device manager and
     intermediate server for devices or device groups and the integrated
     device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0423] In some embodiments, the integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 provides for network based service control
     as described below. In some embodiments and similar to the above
     described network based CRM filtering embodiments, the DPI service
     monitor 5412 or DPC policy implementation 5402 includes secure storage
     (e.g., a secure database) for storing service monitoring information
     (e.g., based on user selections/preferences), and the DPC policy
     implementation 5402 performs traffic shaping/throttling algorithms for
     each user based on the stored service monitoring information from DPI
     service monitor 5412. For example, network based DPI traffic inspection
     by the DPI service monitor 5412 can use the secure storage to save
     service monitoring information for each user indexed by the user
     credentials or other parameters, such as IP address or other network tag.
     As another example, the DPC policy implementation 5402, for example,
     which can be supervised by policy management server 1652 as described
     herein with respect to various other embodiments, can implement service
     usage history statistical analysis inside the secure storage and maintain
     a service usage history analysis for each device/user and/or perform
     various traffic shaping and/or throttling algorithms based on various
     device, user selected and/or service plan related settings (e.g., for
     network neutrality purposes) allowing for various higher level service
     usage goals for one or more users, as similarly described herein with
     respect to various device based service usage monitoring embodiments
     (e.g., except for certain encrypted network traffic flows or application
     related flows for which traffic control generally needs information from
     the application level and/or content specific traffic control).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0424] In some embodiments, input is collected on how to implement service
     control (e.g., from the user of the device). For example, such input can
     be determined based on one or more of the following: a service plan
     choice for the device; input provided by a user via a website (e.g., web
     based portal) for indicating changes to service control policies, as
     similarly described above; input provided by a user via the device (e.g.,
     including the service processor 115), which securely communicates the
     input to the DPC policy implementation 5402, for example, which can be
     supervised by the policy management server 1652; and input provided by a
     user via the device (e.g., including the service processor 115), which
     securely communicates the input to an intermediate server for the DPC
     policy implementation 5402, as similarly described above. In some
     embodiments, such service control is based on various algorithms as
     described herein that identify the heaviest usage service activities and
     recursively control the speed for those activities while leaving certain
     others unaffected, and in a manner that is specified or selected by the
     user to ensure network neutrality. In some embodiments, the user is
     offered a choice for controlling service usage and/or selects an
     algorithm that controls all activities equally/neutrally (e.g., based on
     selected user preferences). For example, by implementing service control
     algorithms that are network neutral (e.g., throttling all activities
     equally or throttling the highest usage algorithms without singling out
     certain activities for throttling unless they satisfy certain network
     neutral usage history or usage statistics criteria), or that are
     approved, selected or otherwise specified by the user, network neutral
     traffic control or service usage control can be maintained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0425] In some embodiments, the DPI service monitor 5412, possibly in
     conjunction with the service usage notification 5420 and/or service
     history server 1650, provides service usage/service cost (e.g., a
     real-time service usage counter) related notifications to the device
     based on user preferences, as similarly described above with respect to
     various device based service usage/service related notification
     embodiments. For example, the DPI service monitor 5412, for example, in
     conjunction with the service usage notification 5420 and/or service
     history server 1650, can perform service usage/service related
     notification algorithms based on one or more of the following: service
     plans, device settings, and/or user selected preferences (e.g., such
     notification messages can be securely communicated to the device and/or
     to the device via an intermediate server). For example, the policies that
     govern how the user is notified of service usage or service cost can be
     determined by the policy management server 1652 and/or the service usage
     notification 5420. As another example, user acknowledgements of important
     notification messages and/or user choices related to important service
     usage decisions can be requested, as similarly discussed above with
     respect to device based service usage/control embodiments, which can then
     be communicated to the central billing system 123 as confirmation for any
     such important notification messages (e.g., related to service usage
     overage charges and/or confirmation of service upgrades). In some
     embodiments, various other service usage algorithms related to service
     usage and/or service cost forward projections described herein with
     respect device based service usage forward projection embodiments are
     performed in the network, such as by the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410, and such forward
     projections can then be communicated to each respective device as service
     usage notification messages (e.g., using a push based approach (initiated
     in the network) and/or pull based approach (initiated by a request from
     the device)). For example, these embodiments for projected service usage
     methods, as described herein, can be helpful for determining when the
     user is using services in a manner that will cause the user to run over a
     service limit so that the user can be notified, or the service can be
     controlled or throttled if the user has selected a control or throttling
     option.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0426] In some embodiments, one or more intermediate servers are provided
     for workload balancing and/or off-loading the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 and perform one or more of
     the functions described above with respect to various embodiments of the
     integrated device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410.
     In some embodiments, service plans, device settings, and/or user selected
     preferences are used to associate each device/user with a preprogrammed
     profile to more efficiently associate such devices/users with their
     selected service plans, device settings, and/or user preferences. For
     example, the process of setting a service profile for a given device can
     be determined by assigning the device to a service flow that has the
     pre-defined service profile and is shared with other devices within the
     integrated device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410
     rather than individually processing the service flow manipulations for
     each device. In some embodiments, the act of provisioning and activating
     a service profile for a given devices involves setting up the service
     flow definition and identifier within the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 (if it is not already set
     up) and then assigning the routing of the device credentials to that
     service flow identifier. User preferences can, for example, be accounted
     for by assigning the device service flow to one of several pre-defined
     profiles based on user preferences that are all supported under the same
     service plan. For example, one service flow profile can call for service
     usage notification but no control under the same service plan as another
     service flow profile that calls for less notification but active service
     usage control to maintain user costs to a monthly post-pay limit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0427] In some embodiments, the bill by account function is implemented in
     the context of the integrated device service control, device usage
     monitoring system 5410 or other network based system embodiments
     described herein. For example, the DPI service monitor 5412, in some
     cases in conjunction with service history server 1650, can operate in
     conjunction with bill by account policy settings stored in the billing
     event server 1662 so that service activities are divided into the account
     classifications defined by the service profile settings. The bill by
     account feeds can then be sent to the billing system or to an
     intermediate billing event aggregation server that collects this type of
     deep packet inspection generated information from one or more integrated
     device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410 units to
     aggregate and format the information in a manner that may be used by the
     central billing system 123. In some embodiments, the bill by account
     information collected in a network box like the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 is augmented by bill by
     account information collected on the device as described herein, and any
     intermediate server that can be used to aggregate and format these bill
     by account feeds for the central billing system deals with both types of
     data, from the network and from the devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0428] As shown in FIG. 54, in some embodiments, integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 includes the service control
     server link 1638, which, for example, can be used as described above
     (e.g., with respect to FIG. 16 and other embodiments described herein) to
     communicate with device service processors 115. In some embodiments,
     billing server 1662 within integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 detects service usage events reported by DPI
     service monitor 5412, in some cases in conjunction with service history
     server 1650, generates a billing event that can be recorded or
     transmitted to the central billing system 123. In some embodiments,
     billing server 1662 receives information from device billing agent 1695
     and/or device service monitor agent 1696 and transmits the device service
     usage billing events to the central billing system 123. In some
     embodiments, certain billing events that are advantageously collected in
     the network (e.g., DPI service monitor 5412 and/or billing event server
     1662) are combined with certain billing events that are advantageously
     collected on the device (e.g., service monitor agent 1696 and/or billing
     agent 1695), and both sources of billing information are transmitted to
     the billing system 123. Similarly, in some embodiments, certain service
     usage information is collected with service usage monitor agent 1696, and
     that information is combined with service usage information collected
     from DPI service monitor 5412 and/or service history server 1650 and/or
     service usage 118. In some embodiments, certain service aspects are
     controlled using network based DPC policy implementation 5402, in some
     cases in conjunction with or supervised by network based policy
     management server 1652, and other service aspects are controlled using
     device based policy implementation agent 1690, in some cases in
     conjunction with or supervised by policy control agent 1692. As will now
     be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the numerous
     embodiments described herein, many hybrid approaches to service usage
     monitoring, service control, service notification or service billing can
     be accomplished with some aspects of the policy, notification, control,
     monitoring or billing being implemented/performed on the device apparatus
     described herein and others implemented/performed on the network
     apparatus described herein. The presence of access control integrity
     server 1662 and many other service control verification embodiments
     described herein make it apparent that the integrated device service
     control, device usage monitoring system 5410 embodiments also provide for
     affirmative verification of whatever functions are implemented on the
     device. It will also be apparent that all of the above combinations of
     device and network functions, and many others, can be accomplished in
     ways that are network neutral and/or protect user privacy preferences by
     implementing the service control algorithms in a network neutral manner
     and/or receiving user preference input on how to implement service
     control, and by maintaining service usage and CRM information security
     and filtering on both the device 100 and the network based integrated
     device service control, device usage monitoring system 5410.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0429] In some embodiments, the integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 facilitates or plays a part in automated
     provisioning and activation of the devices as similarly described above
     with respect to various device based automated provisioning and
     activation embodiments. In some embodiments, the activation server 160 is
     integrated into or partially integrated into device service control,
     device usage monitoring system 5410.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0430] In some embodiments, the integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 facilitates ambient services as similarly
     described above with respect to various device based ambient services
     embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0431] In some embodiments, the integrated device service control, device
     usage monitoring system 5410 facilitates VSP and ODI solutions as
     similarly described above with respect to various device based VSP and
     ODI embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0432] Various other network architectures for network based service
     control including deep packet inspection functions can similarly be used
     as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the
     various embodiments described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0433] FIG. 55 illustrates another network architecture for locating
     service controller device control functions with AAA and network service
     usage including deep packet inspection functions in accordance with some
     embodiments. As shown, the service processor 115 is not present on the
     devices 100, and the integrated device service control, device usage
     monitoring system 5510 performs all service monitoring, service control,
     billing, and notification functions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0434] FIG. 56 illustrates a 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC enabled gateway in
     accordance with some embodiments. As shown, a 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC enabled
     gateway 5610 (e.g., implemented in either gateway 420 or gateway 410 or a
     combination of both) where the conventional service gateway functions
     5616 (e.g., routing, switching, protocol translation/tunneling, charging
     data function (CDF), charging gateway function (GCF), mobility
     management, and/or suspend/resume) are combined with one or more of the
     following embodiments and integrated into one or a combination of the
     service gateways (e.g., RAN and/or transport gateways): DPI service
     monitor 5412, service history server 1650, device usage 118, DPC policy
     implementation 5402, policy management server 1652, user notification
     5618, billing event server 1662, access control integrity server 1654,
     service control service link 1638, data plane I/O 5612 (e.g., used to
     represent the I/O port(s) for the gateway), and/or DPI/DPC gateway
     control plane link 5622 (e.g., used to represent the control plane
     network channel connecting the above elements to other network equipment
     and in communication with gateway control communication 5620). The packet
     processing architecture shown in this figure calls for a multi-point to
     multi-point backplane bus scheme, but it will apparent that other data
     path configurations are possible including serial. As will also be
     apparent, the above described configuration can also be applied to either
     the transport gateway 420 and/or the RAN gateway 410. As mentioned above,
     it is possible to maintain a secure storage on the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateway 420 or 410 that requires secure credentials to get into so that
     user privacy is protected and service usage information or CRM
     information is filtered according to user preferences prior to sending to
     another network function or network manager, and the same allowances can
     also be applied for emergency or government monitoring purposes. Network
     neutrality can also be maintained in this configuration by maintaining
     network neutrality in the service control algorithm and/or soliciting
     user input on how to control service usage just as discussed above for
     other network service control implementations or as discussed in the
     device based service control descriptions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0435] In some embodiments, the bill by account function is implemented in
     the context of the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5610 embodiment or other
     network based system embodiments described herein. For example, the bill
     by account information can be completely derived from the network box
     (e.g., 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5610) without assistance from device
     based service monitoring or billing capabilities, or none may exist on
     the device. In this example, the DPI service monitor 5412, in some cases
     in conjunction with service history server 1650, can operate in
     conjunction with bill by account policy settings stored in the billing
     event server 1662 so that service activities are divided into the account
     classifications defined by the service profile settings. The bill by
     account feeds can then be sent to the billing system or to an
     intermediate billing event aggregation server that collects this type of
     deep packet inspection generated information from one or 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateway 5610 units to aggregate and format the information in a manner
     that can be used by the central billing system 123. In some embodiments,
     the bill by account information collected in a network box, such as the
     4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5610, is augmented, refined or otherwise added
     to by bill by account information collected on the device as described
     herein and any intermediate server that can be used to aggregate and
     format these bill by account feeds for the central billing system deals
     with both types of data, from the network and from the devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0436] FIG. 57 illustrates a network architecture including the VSP
     workstation server 4910 in communication with the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateways 410 and 420 in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, the
     VSP workstation server 4910 is in communication with the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateways 410 and/or 420, the Service Controller Design, Policy Analysis,
     Test, Publishing System 4835, and/or other networking elements including
     possibly the central billing system 123, the mobile wireless center 132
     (HLR) and/or the AAA server 121 for the purpose of provisioning and/or
     controlling settings in the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateways 410 and/or 420, the
     mobile wireless center 132 and possibly other equipment for the purpose
     of implementing a portion of the VSP open partner functionality discussed
     herein. In FIG. 57, the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5610 functionality as
     shown in FIG. 56 is implemented in the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC RAN gateway 410
     and/or the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC transport gateway 420 as similarly described
     above. For example, the VSP functionality can also be used to set higher
     level policies associated with the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 420 or 410,
     such as provisioning or activation profiles or policies, ambient service
     profiles or policies, and/or bill by account service profiles or the
     other higher level service profile or service plan embodiments discussed
     herein. In some embodiments, the provisioning and/or activation steps
     described herein involve setting service policies in the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateway 420 or 410. In some embodiments, ambient services or ambient
     activation involve setting up service profiles within the 4G/3G/2G
     DPI/DPC gateway 420 or 410 that allow the desired activities and block
     the undesired activities. For example, these settings can be included as
     part of the open service provider partner programming capabilities of the
     VSP workstation server 4910 embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0437] FIG. 58 illustrates another 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC enabled gateway in
     accordance with some embodiments. As shown, a 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway
     5810 (e.g., implemented in either gateway 420 and/or gateway 410) is
     provided in which the service processor connection (e.g., via service
     control server link 1638 as shown in FIG. 56) is not present so that all
     service monitoring, control, billing event collection and transmission,
     and notification are performed by the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5610
     (e.g., gateways 410 and/or 420).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0438] FIG. 59 illustrates another network architecture including the VSP
     workstation server 4910 in communication with the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateways 410 and 420, the AAA 121 and the mobile wireless center 132 in
     accordance with some embodiments. As shown, FIG. 59 provides a network
     diagram corresponding to FIG. 58, with similar functionality to the
     embodiment shown in FIG. 57, in which the service processors 115 are not
     present on the devices 100. In FIG. 59, the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5810
     functionality as shown in FIG. 58 is implemented in the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     RAN gateway 410 and/or the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC transport gateway 420 as
     similarly described above.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0439] FIG. 60 illustrates a 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC enabled gateway and service
     controller device control system in accordance with some embodiments. In
     some embodiments, enhanced network based service monitoring, control,
     billing and notification as discussed above is implemented using a
     4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC enabled gateway 6010 and service controller device
     control system 6025 as shown. In some embodiments, the functions shown in
     the figure to be inside of the service controller device control system
     6025 have been moved from the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 5610 of FIG. 56
     (e.g., or from gateways 410 and/or 420) so that they reside in a separate
     server embodiment or other network equipment function separate from the
     4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 6010. For example, this architecture can be used
     when the network equipment manufacturer desires to separate these
     functions or has an existing product that it is desirable to upgrade by
     adding a separate box. As another example, this architecture can be used
     when the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 6010 is not capable of keeping up with
     large numbers of individual user profiles so it is desirable to go to a
     scalable server configuration in which load balancing can be applied with
     a potentially more flexible programming environment for implementing
     service policy management functions, statistical service history analysis
     algorithms, service usage projection, and/or service control (or
     throttling) algorithms. In some embodiments, a secure storage is provided
     on the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateway 6010 and/or the service controller device
     control system 6025 that requires secure credentials to get into so that,
     for example, user privacy can be protected and service usage information
     or CRM information can be filtered according to user preferences prior to
     sending to another network function or network manager, and the same
     allowances can also be applied, for example, for emergency or government
     monitoring purposes. For example, network neutrality can also be
     maintained in this configuration by maintaining network neutrality in the
     service control algorithm construction and/or soliciting user input on
     how to control service usage just as discussed above for other network
     service control implementations or as discussed in the device based
     service control descriptions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0440] FIG. 61 illustrates another network architecture including the VSP
     workstation server 4910 in communication with the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateways 410 and 420, AAA 121 and mobile wireless center 132 in
     accordance with some embodiments. In FIG. 61, the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateway 6010 functionality as shown in FIG. 60 is implemented in the
     4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC RAN gateway 410 and/or the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC transport
     gateway 420, as similarly described above, and which are in communication
     with the service controller device control system 6025 as shown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0441] FIG. 62 illustrates another 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC enabled gateway and
     service controller device control system in accordance with some
     embodiments. As shown, the capability to communicate with the service
     processor 115 has been removed so that all service monitoring, control,
     billing event collection and transmission, and notification are performed
     by the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC gateways 6210 (e.g., implemented in gateways 410
     and/or 420) in conjunction with the service controller device control
     system 6225 without assistance from the service processors 115.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0442] FIG. 63 illustrates another network architecture including the VSP
     workstation server 4910 in communication with the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateways 410 and 420, AAA 121 and mobile wireless center 132 in
     accordance with some embodiments. In FIG. 61, the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC
     gateway 6210 functionality as shown in FIG. 62 is implemented in the
     4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC RAN gateway 410 and/or the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC transport
     gateway 420, as similarly described above, and which are in communication
     with the service controller device control system 6225 as shown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0443] As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the above
     described embodiments can be extended to include some or all of the
     functions depicted in the 4G/3G/2G DPI/DPC service gateways of FIG. 56 in
     the base station or base station controller 125.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Provisioning and Activation
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0444] In some embodiments, automated provisioning and activation includes
     automation of one or more of the following functions: (1) programming
     device credentials or partial credentials and recording them in a
     database (or providing same when they are programmed into the device),
     (2) associating these credentials with the proper provisioning and/or
     activation actions to be taken on the device and in the network, (3)
     directing the device to the proper activation function (e.g., activation
     server) sequence when it attempts to connect to the network, (4)
     completing provisioning of the device, (5) programming the AAA, billing
     system, gateways, mobile wireless center and other network equipment to
     the proper initial device service control settings, and (6) establishing
     a service account for the device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0445] In some embodiments, improved processes for activating service for
     a device or user with a network service provided by a central provider
     network, an MVNO network or a VSP on the central provider network are
     provided. In some embodiments, activation includes one or more of the
     following: a process or result of associating a service account with
     device or user credentials; with the service account potentially further
     being associated with a service profile defining the service activities
     that the device is authorized to access; creating or updating a service
     usage or billing record and associating it with the service account to
     create a service plan; and/or initiating service to the device or user in
     which the network equipment allows access to the appropriate level of
     service activities. In some embodiments, VSP embodiments include the
     provisioning and activation apparatus embodiments of any or all forms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0446] In conventional mobile device provisioning systems, the
     provisioning and activation process required to create a user service
     account and enable the device to access the desired level of service
     activities can limit mass market, low cost or user friendly applications
     of the device or service, because the process can often be cumbersome,
     time consuming and/or expensive for the service provider, service owner,
     master agent (service distributor), MVNO, VSP and/or user. Accordingly,
     the various embodiments for provisioning and activation described herein
     simplify the provisioning and activation process for mobile devices. In
     some embodiments, provisioning and activation for the device and/or the
     network accommodates a wide variety of device types and service profile
     types, with the capability to perform the provisioning and activation at
     a number of points in the manufacturing, distribution, sales and usage
     progression for the device, and the ability to either pre-activate before
     first device use or very quickly activate during first device use (or
     during some later use of the device).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0447] In some embodiments, as described herein, the term provisioning
     generally refers to those actions/processes associated with programming
     the device with credentials or other device settings or software
     installations used to later activate the device, as well as, in some
     embodiments, creating database entries and other credential associations
     in the network so that the network and/or device have the information
     used to recognize the device or credentials and implement the service
     policies in the service profile and/or service plan once the service
     profile and/or service plan are activated. In some embodiments, as
     described herein, the term activation generally refers to the process of
     creating or selecting the service plan and/or service profile,
     programming the settings that are used in each (e.g., required) network
     function and/or each (e.g., required) device function so that the system
     can properly associate the device credentials with the appropriate
     service activity policies, and then admitting the device onto the
     network. The term activation can also refer in some embodiments to the
     creation of a user or device service account, in some cases, with user or
     device owner information or billing information. In some embodiments, the
     process of provisioning amounts to assigning credentials to the device
     and programming a portion or all of the credentials on the device,
     entering a portion or all of the credentials in the various necessary
     network equipment databases so that the network components are capable of
     identifying the device and associating it with the network based portion
     of the admission, traffic processing, service monitoring, billing,
     service limits and other policies that are eventually defined by the
     service profile and service plan.

   [0448] Further examples of the network based service profile policies
     include network access level, traffic routing, service monitoring,
     service limits and actions taken upon reaching service limits. Once the
     service profile is created and activated during the activation process,
     the device credentials and the associated service profile are
     communicated throughout the necessary network elements so that each
     element can implement its part of the network portion of the service
     profile policies. This process of propagating the service profile
     settings to all the required network equipment components is a portion of
     what is referred to herein as activation in accordance with some
     embodiments. In some embodiments, the activation process includes
     associating the credentials with the proper service plan and/or service
     profile, and possibly completing the process of programming the device
     functions and/or network functions so that the device can be admitted to
     the appropriate level of network services. In some embodiments,
     activation also includes the service processor software settings,
     configurations or installs for each function or agent in the service
     processor to implement its part of the service profile, service plan,
     service billing or transaction billing policies. In some embodiments,
     activation also includes the creation of entries in the various service
     account databases and/or billing databases to create a user account or
     device owner account for the purpose of managing the user choices for
     service plan and other account information storage and management
     aspects, such as maintaining status information, maintaining the central
     service profile configuration, conducting reconciliation and billing
     exchanges, service usage history, and/or account history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0449] In some embodiments, the term credentials generally refers to the
     set of information parameters that the network and/or device uses (e.g.,
     requires) to admit the device onto the network and associate it with the
     appropriate service profile and/or service plan. For example, the
     credentials can include one or more of the following: phone number,
     device identification number, MEID or similar mobile device identifier,
     hardware security device ID, security signature or other security
     credentials, device serial number, device identification and/or
     credential information via security hardware such as a SIM, one or more
     IP addresses, one or more MAC addresses, any other network address
     identifier, embedded device descriptive information block (static or
     programmable), security key, security signature algorithms, passwords or
     other secure authorization information, service processor (or similar
     device client or agent software) identifier or settings or version,
     device type identifier, browser (e.g., http, https, WAP, other browser
     client) header information or similar identifier, browser token
     information or similar identifier, browser cookie information or similar
     identifier, embedded browser instructions, portal-client (e.g., interface
     or communication agent that connects to a network portal used at least in
     part for provisioning or activation for the device or by the user) header
     information or similar identifier, portal-client token information or
     similar identifier, portal-client cookie information or similar
     identifier, embedded portal-client instructions, service provider, OEM,
     master agent (service distributor), VSP, device service owner identifier,
     distributor or master agent, and/or any information the network can use
     to authorize network admission, provision the device, provision the
     network, activate service, authorize, associate or enable the device with
     a provisioning sequence, associate or enable the device with one or more
     service profiles, associate or assist the device with an activation
     sequence, associate or enable the device with an ambient profile or
     service experience, associate or enable the device with one or more
     service plans or service capabilities, associate the device with a
     service provider or service owner, associate the device with an OEM or
     master agent, associate the device with a distributor or master agent, or
     associate the device with a device group, user group or user. In some
     embodiments, at least some of the credentials are unique to the device,
     and, in some embodiments, groups of devices share one or more aspects of
     the credentials. In some embodiments, the term permanent credentials
     generally refers to the set of credentials that include at least a subset
     that are intended to be assigned to a device or user on a permanent
     basis. In some embodiments, the term temporary credentials generally
     refers to the set of credentials that include at least a subset that are
     intended to be assigned to a device or user on a temporary basis. In some
     embodiments, temporary credentials are eventually replaced by permanent
     credentials. In some embodiments, at least some elements in the temporary
     credentials (e.g., phone number and/or access or authorization security
     credential) are used for more than one device. In some embodiments, the
     temporary credentials are recycled from one or more devices and used for
     one or more other devices, for example, when they remain unused for a
     period of time or when they are replaced with permanent credentials on
     one or more devices. It should not be inferred from the term permanent
     credentials that permanent credentials are never recycled, for example,
     when the user discontinues service or use of the credentials. Also, the
     term temporary credentials does not imply that temporary credentials are
     always temporary. In some embodiments, partial credentials or
     pre-activation credentials generally refer to a subset of credentials
     that are to gain access to limited network services for the purpose of
     provisioning of credentials and/or activation of a service plan or
     service profile. For example, prior to a phone number being assigned, a
     device can gain access to a limited set of network server destinations in
     which embedded information contained in the device (e.g., the partial
     credentials) is provided to the server, the server associates that
     information with the proper additional credentials (including the phone
     number) to assign to the device and/or associates the information with
     the proper service profile to activate service. In this example, partial
     credentials can include device type, OEM, service provider, VSP, device
     identification number, SIM, service processor configuration or some other
     information used by the server to determine what the credentials should
     be and the proper service profile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0450] In some embodiments, a permanent service account generally refers
     to the service account that is permanently associated with the user
     and/or device. For example, this account includes an association with the
     device or user credentials, user information or billing information,
     service profile, billing profile, network authorization status and other
     aspects that define the device or user service policies and billing
     policies. In some embodiments, the term temporary service account
     generally refers to a service account that is temporarily set up and
     associated with the device before some or all of the required permanent
     account information is available or entered for a device or user. For
     example, this account can be set up with an association with an actual
     user, or can be set up with a mock user or unassigned user association so
     that the network and billing system can recognize the credentials,
     authenticate the device, admit the device, provide the proper level of
     service activity control according to the service profile associated with
     the temporary service account, or collect the service activity usage
     information for various network and billing system accounting needs
     before actual user information or billing information has been entered
     into the network systems. For example, a temporary service account can
     make it possible or easier to use existing billing systems or other
     network systems to provide simplified provisioning, simplified activation
     or ambient services. A temporary service account can also become a
     permanent service account by replacing mock user or unassigned user
     information with actual user information, or a temporary service account
     may need to be replaced by a permanent service account when actual user
     information needs to be entered into the network systems, possibly
     including the billing or service profile databases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0451] In some embodiments, temporary or permanent device credentials and
     other information used/required for provisioning the device are generated
     with apparatus located at the manufacturer or in the distribution channel
     as discussed below. In some embodiments, the apparatus includes a local
     onsite server that typically shares some aspects of the provisioning
     information (e.g., phone number, phone number range, MEID or MEID range,
     SIM number or SIM number range, IP address or IP address range, MAC
     address or MAC address range, other secure device credential elements)
     with a network provisioning database. In some embodiments, the apparatus
     includes a server terminal, and the aforementioned portion of the
     credentials is generated by the network and shared with the local
     provisioning apparatus. In some embodiments, as will be discussed below,
     the provisioning credentials are in part generated in the network and
     shared with the device while it is connected online to an activation
     server (e.g., activation server 160) that is connected to the access
     network. Similarly, there can be activation servers connected to
     apparatus in the manufacturing or distribution channel that service
     device activation, or over the air or over the network apparatus
     connected to an activation server, which in turn connects to the device,
     can be used to accomplish activation programming of the network and
     device as further discussed below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0452] In some embodiments, when a device is provisioned and entered into
     the network provisioning database, it is associated with the automatic
     provisioning and/or activation sequence the device is intended to go
     through once it connects to the network or to the apparatus that will
     complete the process. In some embodiments, one or more device parameters
     (e.g., service owner, device type, OEM, plan type, IP address, security
     credential and/or software version) are used to determine what the
     appropriate network provisioning steps and/or settings are for completing
     the provisioning and/or activation process, and this association
     information is stored in the network provisioning database for
     propagation of the provisioning profiles or activation profiles to the
     various network equipment elements. In some embodiments, the network
     provisioning database is provided (e.g., in the network) that associates
     the pre-activation provisioning information (e.g., generated, as
     described herein, at time of manufacture, sometime during distribution,
     by the user on a website by a sales associate or other activation
     assistant, or by the network when a new device enters the automatic
     activation process). For example, the pre-activation provisioning
     information informs the network whether or not to let the device onto an
     activation sequence when the device attempts access, and in some cases,
     also instructs the network to direct the device to a specific activation
     sequence including, for example, an activation server (or other
     activation sequencing apparatus) sequence as described herein. In some
     embodiments, a central database is queried by other network equipment or
     the central database is included in one or more of the network elements
     (e.g., the AAA server and/or billing system, mobile wireless center 132),
     or the database is copied in part or in whole in various network elements
     (e.g., the central database, AAA server, mobile wireless center, billing
     system and/or gateways).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0453] In some embodiments, propagating the network equipment provisioning
     information for a given device or group of devices is accomplished with a
     network provisioning system that has access to the network provisioning
     database and is capable of programming the appropriate network equipment.
     In some embodiments, this network equipment is referred to as "network
     management" equipment or "network provisioning" equipment. In some
     embodiments, there are several functions that take part individually or
     in concert, including, for example, the AAA server 121, service
     controller 122 (either with device based/assisted services through the
     service processor related embodiments or with network only embodiments as
     described herein), the mobile wireless center 132 (e.g., including the
     home location register (HLR) or other similar function referred to by
     other industry terms), the activation server(s) 160, other network
     provisioning or management equipment attached to or associated with the
     billing database system, and/or some other equipment apparatus. In some
     embodiments, the local database on the device, database in the AAA server
     and/or database elsewhere in network is provisioned to inform the gateway
     of the process for handling the pre-provisioned device according to, for
     example, the credentials. For example, if the device is not recognized or
     not authenticated onto the access network as an activated device with
     associated active service profile and/or service plan, the device
     connection or communication can be directed (or routed) to a generic
     activation server that provides an activation sequence that is not
     necessarily determined by one or more of the specific device credential
     elements, partial credential elements, device profile or partial device
     profile that define something specific about the activation sequence for
     the device. In another example, in which the device is not recognized or
     authenticated as an activated device with associated service profile
     and/or service plan, the device can be directed (or routed) to an
     activation service (or other activation sequencing apparatus) that uses
     some part of the credentials or range of partial credentials or a portion
     of a partial or complete device profile to determine a desired
     pre-determined device specific or device group specific activation
     sequence that is implemented by a specific activation service sequence or
     other activation sequence apparatus. In another example, in which the
     device is not recognized or authenticated as an activated device with
     associated active service profile and/or service plan, a portion of the
     device credentials or partial credentials can be used as a look-up index
     into a database that determines what the specific device activation
     sequence should be, and the device can be directed (or routed) to a
     specific activation server sequence or other activation sequencing
     apparatus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0454] In some embodiments, a database in the AAA server or database
     elsewhere in network is provisioned to inform the gateway what to do with
     a pre-provisioned device according to the credentials. For example,
     devices can be authenticated (for activated devices), routed to
     activation servers (or other activation sequencing apparatus) or denied
     access. In some embodiments, the AAA server (and/or other network
     elements) provide the above discussed look-up function for the above
     gateway description in which a lookup database, locally stored or stored
     in a central database, is queried to provide secondary routing
     information to the specific or generic activation servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0455] In some embodiments, the pre-provisioned database is located in the
     billing system. In some embodiments, the billing system accesses the
     pre-provisioned database (e.g., stored on the billing system or another
     network element) for the purpose of setting up temporary accounts or
     permanent accounts and associating those accounts with pre-activation
     status, activated free ambient or activated paying customer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0456] In some embodiments, for zero activation, all the required
     pre-provisioning or programming of the above network elements, or others,
     is coordinated by the network provisioning system at some point after the
     partial or full device credentials have been associated with the device
     or reserved for a particular device type or service type. In some
     embodiments, the network provisioning system also coordinates the
     information to or from the device provisioning apparatus that is
     described elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0457] In view of the various embodiments described herein, it will be
     appreciated that many of the automated or background provisioning,
     activation and ambient embodiments described herein can be accomplished
     with network based approaches, device based approaches, or network/device
     combination/hybrid based approaches. For example, when the access control
     for the provisioning process is accomplished in the device (e.g., a
     device based approach), the activation server can be located anywhere on
     the Internet, and the device will ensure that the activation process is
     conducted with the activation server while blocking other traffic from
     occurring. As another example, some or all of the ambient provisioning
     programming steps become steps to program the access control, traffic
     control, application control, bill by account rules, and/or other aspects
     in the service processor or service controller as described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0458] In some embodiments, the provisioning apparatus described herein
     can be a computer located in the user's home or business, and the user or
     an IT manager has access to a website that provides the provisioning
     information, in which the computer serves as the provisioning or software
     programming apparatus. In some embodiments, the network itself, possibly
     through an activation server 160, website or other interface to the
     device, becomes the provisioning apparatus, in some cases, with the
     assistance of software on the device to affect the programming of
     provisioning information from the network or the communication of device
     credentials or other information to the network. For example, this
     software can be a background process that runs without user interaction,
     a portal/widget program, a web browser based program, a WAP browser based
     program, and/or any other program that provides a counterpart function to
     the network functions effecting the provisioning (e.g., activation
     server). In some embodiments, the activation server either initiates a
     specific provisioning sequence if device software is present to assist or
     routes to a website for manual entry if there is no software present.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0459] FIG. 64 illustrates another network architecture including a system
     located in the manufacturing or distribution chain for the device that
     provides the device provisioning or partial provisioning, and any
     pre-activation required for the device to later activate on the network
     in accordance with some embodiments. Device credential, software and
     settings server 6420 provides a link to the network functions that
     generate or provide device credentials, and/or associate device
     credentials with activation profiles or pre-activation profiles in the
     network equipment (e.g., the billing system 123, service controller
     device control system 6225, gateways 410, 420, base station 125,
     credential generation and association server 6410, activation server 160,
     service download control server 1660 and/or other network apparatus). For
     example, the link between the device credential, software and settings
     server 6420 to the central provider core network equipment can be over
     the Internet 120 (e.g., a secure link over the Internet) as shown or over
     another connection such as a leased line. The device credential, software
     and settings server 6420 obtains credentials or partial credentials from
     the network apparatus that generates them, illustrated by the credential
     generation &amp; association server 6410. Credential generation &amp; association
     server 6410 need not be directly connected to the central provider core
     network 110 as shown, but can be located elsewhere (e.g., in another
     location connected by a secure Internet link). Credential generation &amp;
     association server 6410 assigns credentials, or partial credentials, for
     use by device credential, software and settings server 6420. When these
     credentials are assigned to a device, they are programmed, loaded or
     otherwise associated with the device by device credential provisioning
     apparatus 6430, which is connected to the device wirelessly or via a wire
     line connection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0460] In some embodiments, a device software loading and programming
     apparatus 6440 provides software loading or device settings functions
     that form a portion or all of the provisioning or pre-provisioning device
     configuration, or form a portion or all of the device activation profile
     configuration, or form the device service owner, master agent or VSP
     device assignment or signature, and in some embodiments, using an
     activation tracking service (ATS) system. As discussed herein, the ATS
     monitors network connections and aspects of traffic that provide insight
     into which networks the device 100 is gaining access to, in some
     embodiments, for the purpose of ensuring that an OEM, master agent,
     device service owner or VSP is being compensated for devices that
     activate on a service provider network. In some embodiments, the ATS
     agent connects to a server counterpart that records and, in some
     embodiments, also analyzes the service or network connection information
     to make a determination of the type of access service the device is
     receiving and, in some cases, determine which networks the device is
     activated on. In some embodiments, the ATS is installed on the device in
     a manner that makes it difficult to tamper with or remove so that the
     entity that is intended to get credit for device service activation does
     get credit (e.g., the ATS agent can be loaded into secure memory, it can
     be installed with software that makes it difficult to de-install, it can
     be installed on the modem possibly in secure memory, it can be installed
     in the BIOS, it can be installed deep in the OS kernel, it can be
     installed with one or more additional device agents that monitor the ATS
     agent and alert a network function or re-install it if tampered with).
     The SIM inventory 6450 is provided to illustrate that, in some
     embodiments, hardware elements (e.g., a SIM security module as shown) or
     hardware configurations are also installed or manipulated in device 100
     and these operations and the recording of the resulting associations form
     a portion of the provisioning or pre-provisioning process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0461] In some embodiments, at the time the credentials or partial
     credentials are loaded, programmed, set, installed, read from the device
     or otherwise recorded, they are, in some cases, all associated together
     in a database that allows for later identification of the device and its
     appropriate provisioning and/or activation process through such
     associations. For example, this can involve reading device parameters
     such as MEID, MAC address, device type, or other information that is
     associated with the information being loaded or configured on the device.
     As discussed herein, this credential configuration and association
     information is stored in the network equipment responsible using it to
     configure the network to activate the device in one of the various
     embodiments disclosed herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0462] Some embodiments include tying some or all of the activation
     provisioning steps and information settings together into a database that
     defines a higher level activation profile for a group of users(/devices),
     and a server is used to perform device and equipment programming for the
     devices in the group, including, for example, associating the following
     device information into the group definition: credentials, service owner
     or master agent, provisioning information and/or activation profile. Some
     embodiments further provide for this device group information being
     distributed to the various network equipment components required to
     activate the devices as discussed elsewhere. In some embodiments, this
     programming and device group association is accomplished using the VSP
     workstation server 4910. For example, a device can be manufactured and
     distributed in a manner that provides flexible assignment of the device
     to a group that is assigned to an activation profile or a service owner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0463] In some embodiments, multiple activation servers 160 are provided
     (as shown), which illustrates that there can be multiple device
     activation servers 160 each with a different device activation experience
     and potentially controlled by a different VSP, service owner, service
     provider, OEM or master agent. As discussed herein, there are several
     ways that a device 100 can be routed to the proper activation server 160
     so that the device provisioning and activation process can be completed.
     In some embodiments, all devices that are not activated are re-directed
     (or routed) to an activation server that reads one or more parameters in
     the device credentials. The device credential information can be
     determined either through the device identification information
     associated with the access network connection itself (e.g., MEID, IP
     address, phone number, security credentials, or other credentials
     identified for a device that gains access with the network), or with the
     aid of the device in a pre-arranged query-response sequence. The device
     can then be re-directed (or routed) to the appropriate activation server
     for that device, device group, device service owner or VSP. In some
     embodiments, the same process described above can be accomplished with a
     single re-direction from a service gateway 420 or 410, or another router
     enable network element. In some embodiments, the gateway or network
     element itself decodes the device credential information as described
     herein and performs the correct re-direct (or route) to the appropriate
     activation server 160 for that device. In some embodiments, the
     activation server 160 can be incorporated directly into the gateway 420
     or 410, the base station 125 or other network component. In some
     embodiments, the activation server 160 can be incorporated into the
     service controller 122 or the service controller device control system
     6225.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0464] In some embodiments, apparatus other than the activation server are
     used to facilitate provisioning of credentials or partial credentials, or
     activation, during manufacturing or device distribution, and, for
     example, these apparatus can augment, supplement, compliment or replace
     the activation server function. Such apparatus include, for example,
     device programming equipment (e.g., device credential provisioning
     apparatus 6430, device software loading and programming apparatus 6440 or
     SIM inventory 6450), equipment that is networked into a central provider,
     MVNO or VSP database (e.g., device credential, software and settings
     server 6420) to gain access to provisioning information or activation
     information that is programmed into a device or group of devices, or to
     place device credential or partial credential information in a network
     database for later recognition, or to receive or communicate security
     information such as certificates for devices or SIM modules that will
     later be used to complete provisioning or complete activation or gain
     access to a network. For example, these apparatus, or any other apparatus
     including the activation server, can be networked into a service provider
     network or device database, an MVNO network or device database or a VSP
     network or device database. In some embodiments, programming of the
     device credentials or other information associated with the service
     processor or device is provided, so that, for example, the device can be
     recognized by an activation server or similar network function at a later
     point in time so that provisioning or activation can be completed in an
     automated manner, potentially with reduced or no user involvement, that
     provides a provisioning or activation configuration that is in some way
     unique for the service provider or service provider partner, device type,
     user group, VSP, MVNO, master agent or other entity. In some embodiments,
     this programming is provided in a manner that is difficult to change
     without the proper authorization so that the device is properly
     associated with the proper "service owner" or master agent (e.g., for the
     purpose of activation incentive payments). For example, as discussed
     herein, various approaches can be applied to the device credential or
     other settings or software provisioning so that the settings or software
     are secure or protected, or so that if the software is removed, replaced
     or modified it is reported or replace or restored. In some embodiments,
     VSP control of the provisioning, partial provisioning or activation of
     devices is provided during manufacture or at different points in the
     distribution channel. As discussed herein, some of these embodiments
     allow the central provider to offer to service partners (e.g., VSPs,
     MVNOs, master agents, and/or OEMs) similar types of control for device
     activation experience design or device service assignment control (e.g.,
     sometimes referred to as service provider device locking so that other
     service providers cannot provide primary access to the device) during the
     manufacturing or distribution process that are possible with devices
     manufactured and distributed for the central service provider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0465] In some embodiments, the device is provisioned before the user
     obtains the device with permanent credentials, temporary credentials or
     partial credentials. In this case, the necessary credential programming
     of the device occurs during manufacture, at some point in the device
     distribution, such as at a distribution depot or in a store, or at the
     point of sale or point of shipment. In some embodiments, provisioning of
     network information as discussed above is used, and the network
     information is provisioned at the same time, before or after the device
     information is provisioned. In some embodiments, the device provisioning
     information is programmed with dedicated apparatus that connects to the
     device either with wires or wirelessly. For example, the dedicated
     apparatus can be local to the location where the device is being
     provisioned, or it can be partially or entirely networked into a database
     or provisioning solution located elsewhere and operated by the central
     provider, a VSP, OEM or other entity. For example, the apparatus to
     program the network portions of the provisioning information can also be
     networked and the operators who set up the required network programming
     for a device or group of devices may be in the vicinity of the servers
     that host the provisioning and management tools or they may network into
     the servers. In some embodiments, provisioning system operators have full
     or partial control of any device provisioning equipment associated with
     the entity they work for (e.g., OEM, VSP or master agent) but only have
     remote access via secure terminal, secure website or other techniques to
     network into a central provider or VSP server farm in which they control
     or partially control the network portion of provisioning capabilities for
     that subset of devices that are assigned to the entity they work for with
     (e.g. OEM, VSP or master agent).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0466] In some embodiments, provisioning is accomplished over the air on
     the mobile access network for mobile devices, or over the wired access
     network or WLAN connection for wired access networks, either before the
     user receives the device or after the user receives the device. In some
     cases, the device can be connected to general purpose equipment, such as
     a computer to perform the programming required to complete provisioning.
     In the cases in which the device is provisioned at point of sale or after
     point of sale, the device provisioning can be triggered by a user
     initiated sequence, or can be initiated by an automated background
     sequence at any time after the device is powered on. In such cases, in
     some embodiments, partial credentials that include information such as
     device type, OEM or service provider are used to assist in determining
     how to complete the provisioning, and the information can also include
     secure information, certificate or signature programmed into the partial
     credentials that is required for the network to perform the provisioning
     of the remaining credential information in the device and possibly the
     network. In some embodiments, any network information used/required to
     provision the device or service is generated at the time the partial
     credentials are determined rather than beforehand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0467] In some embodiments, the device is activated for service before the
     user obtains the device with permanent credentials, temporary credentials
     or partial credentials, or with a permanent service account or a
     temporary service account. For example, in this case, the necessary steps
     of provisioning and activating service for the device can occur during
     manufacture, at some point in the device distribution, such as at a
     distribution depot or in a store, or at the point of sale or point of
     shipment. In some embodiments, the steps for activating service include
     one or more of the following: provision the device (e.g., with permanent,
     temporary or partial credentials), provision the necessary network
     databases and equipment to prepare them to recognize the device and
     associate it with the service profile and/or service plan, create or
     select the service account (e.g., permanent or temporary service
     account), select or create the service profile and/or service plan,
     program any elements in the device required to activate service (e.g.,
     account ID, device aspects of the service profile and/or service plan),
     and program the necessary network databases and equipment with the
     required associations of device credentials and service profile and/or
     service plan policy settings. In some embodiments, the device oriented
     programming portions of the service activation steps occur at the same
     time, before or after the network oriented programming portions of the
     service activation steps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0468] In some embodiments, the device activation information is
     programmed with dedicated apparatus that connects to the device via a
     wireless or wire line connection. For example, the dedicated apparatus
     can be local to the location where the device is being provisioned, or
     the dedicated apparatus can be partially or entirely networked into a
     database or service activation solution located elsewhere and operated by
     the central provider, a VSP, OEM or other entity. For example, the
     apparatus to program the network portions of the activation information
     can also be networked and the operators who set up the required network
     programming for a device or group of devices can be in the vicinity of
     the servers that host the service activation and management tools or they
     can network into the servers. In some embodiments, activation server
     tools operators have full or partial control of any device activation
     apparatus associated with the entity they work for (e.g., OEM, VSP or
     master agent) but only have remote and partial access via secure
     terminal, secure website or other techniques to network into the network
     portion of the activation tools that are controlled by the central
     provider or VSP. The server tools operators can be restricted in some
     embodiments to providing network activation information or settings only
     for those devices or device groups that are assigned to the entity they
     work for with (e.g., OEM, VSP or master agent). For example, the device
     control group restriction can be accomplished with a secure database that
     has secure sub-partitions for one or more entities so that they cannot
     impact the control of one another's network activation settings but can
     control their own devices. In this way, a centralized set of activation
     tools resources controlled by a central provider, VSP or other entity can
     be partitioned so that different entities can have partial or full
     control of the activation service definition for devices or groups of
     devices without impact or risk to others who share the network and
     activation tools resources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0469] In some embodiments, activation is accomplished with an over the
     air interface to a mobile device, or over the wired access network or
     WLAN connection for wired access networks, either before the user
     receives the device or after the user receives the device. In some cases,
     the device can be connected to general purpose equipment such as a
     computer to perform the programming required to complete activation. In
     the cases in which the device is activated at point of sale or after
     point of sale, the final device activation process can be triggered by a
     user initiated sequence, or can be initiated by an automated background
     sequence at any time after the device is powered on. In such cases, some
     embodiments call for a temporary service account that is used to bring
     the device onto the network before the user has input the information
     necessary to create a permanent service account. In some embodiments, a
     temporary or permanent service account can be applied to the device at
     the time the device reaches the network, and the type of account, service
     profile and/or service plan can be influenced (e.g., partially determined
     or informed) or determined by information embedded in the device
     credentials or partial credentials, such as device type, device ID, SIM,
     OEM or service provider. For example, the device credentials can also
     include secure information, certificate or signature that can be required
     by the network to perform the activation steps for temporary or permanent
     service account status. In some embodiments, in which the device is
     activated in this manner before the user information is available, or
     before the user has selected a pay for service plan, the service profile
     and service plan are set up for ambient services as described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0470] In some embodiments, the device is activated during the
     manufacturing or distribution process, and then the activated device
     status is suspended. Once the temporary or permanent service account is
     set up, with appropriate service profile and/or service plan and
     temporary or permanent credentials, in some networks and billing systems
     the service can often be more easily resumed once suspended as compared
     to provisioning and activating the device from scratch. The device is
     then later resumed (or re-activated) when some event triggers the resume
     process, such as when it ships to the end user or when the end user
     attempts to use it. This process prevents the network from needing to
     manage credentials and accounts for devices that have been activated but
     are not yet on the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0471] In some embodiments, provisioning is accomplished at least in part
     with temporary credentials in a manner which is automated and convenient
     for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, at least some subset
     of the temporary credential elements replaced at a later point in time by
     permanent credential elements in a manner that is also automated and
     convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, the
     temporary credential set is pre-programmed into the device along with a
     temporary or permanent service account including service profile during
     the manufacturing or distribution process so that the device is activated
     with temporary credentials when it ships. In some embodiments, the
     aforementioned pre-programming is performed for the network via a secure
     set of server access equipment that networks into the network databases
     used to define the service profile and/or the service plan. In some
     embodiments, a subset of the temporary credentials is recycled once it is
     replaced, if a temporary service account is not activated or used after
     some period of time, if a permanent account is not activated or used
     after some period of time, or if the credentials subset is revoked from
     the device for some other reason.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0472] In some embodiments, more than one device is assigned one or more
     elements of the temporary credentials, such as the phone number, which
     may be limited in supply. In some embodiments, a network will accept more
     than one set of temporary credentials, one or more redundant elements,
     for two or more different devices. In some embodiments, a device that has
     two or more temporary credential sets, in which at least a subset of the
     credential elements are different for the sets, so that if one set of
     credentials has elements that are already being used to access the
     network, then one or more reserve sets can be drawn upon to gain access
     to the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0473] In some embodiments, the temporary credentials are used to log onto
     the network to conduct an over the air or over the network activation
     process in which an activation server reads at least a portion the device
     credentials to determine some aspect of how the device service profile.
     In some embodiments, the aforementioned over the air activation process
     is accomplished in the background without user intervention. In some
     embodiments, the over the air activation process is initiated when the
     user first attempts to use the device or when the user first attempts to
     access the network or upon user request or approval. In some embodiments,
     the over the air activation process is initiated using a temporary
     service account for the device and/or network to gain access to the
     network. In some embodiments, the over the air activation process is
     initiated after the user has entered the information required to create a
     permanent user account into the device or into the network. In some
     embodiments, the user is required to enter the aforementioned user
     information before using the device or using some aspect of the device.
     In some embodiments, the temporary service account is replaced by a
     permanent service account some time after the user has entered the
     necessary information to create a permanent account into the device or
     network. In some embodiments, the over the air activation process is
     initiated using a permanent service account assignment for the device
     and/or network to gain access to the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0474] In some embodiments, the service profile is assigned to the device
     and/or network during the aforementioned over the air activation to be a
     pay for service profile with a free trial period. In some embodiments,
     the service profile assigned to the device and/or network during the
     aforementioned over the air activation includes pre-pay, post-pay,
     session based pay or pay as you go options for service. As will be
     apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, various embodiments
     disclosed herein are particularly well suited for control or pre-pay
     services. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to
     the device and/or network during the aforementioned over the air
     activation is an ambient service profile providing service access before
     all the user information is available to assign a permanent account. In
     some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device
     and/or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service
     profile providing a service upgrade selection option interface to the
     user. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the
     device and/or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient
     service profile providing transaction services to the user. In some
     embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and/or
     network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service
     profile providing bill by account functionality for the network. In some
     embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and/or
     network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service
     profile providing some amount of free networking or information service
     to entice the user to use the other ambient services. In some
     embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is at least partially
     implemented with device based service activity control or control
     assistance. In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is at
     least partially implemented by gateways, routers or switches in the
     network that are programmed according to the ambient access profile for
     the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control,
     routing control, traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for
     bill by account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0475] In some embodiments, activation is accomplished at least in part
     with a temporary service account in a manner that is automated and
     convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, at least
     some subset of the temporary service account is replaced at a later point
     in time by permanent service account subset in a manner that is also
     automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some
     embodiments, the temporary service account settings (e.g., including the
     service profile settings and/or the service plan settings) are
     pre-programmed into the device along with a temporary or permanent
     credentials set during the manufacturing or distribution process so that
     the device is activated with temporary credentials when it ships. In some
     embodiments, the aforementioned pre-programming for the network is
     performed via a secure set of server access equipment that networks into
     the network databases used to define the service profile and/or the
     service plan. In some embodiments, the device is suspended once it is
     activated but before the user is using it, and then resumed before or
     commensurate with the point in time that the user begins to use it. In
     some embodiments, some subset of the temporary service account is
     recycled once it is replaced, if the temporary service account is not
     used after some period of time, if the temporary service account is not
     upgraded to a permanent service account after some period of time, or if
     the activation is revoked from the device for some other reason. In some
     embodiments, more than one device is assigned to the same temporary
     service account. In some embodiments, a network accepts more than one
     device on the same temporary service account. In some embodiments, a
     device includes or is associated with two or more temporary service
     accounts, in which at least a subset of the temporary service account
     elements are different, so that if one account is already being used to
     access the network then one or more reserve accounts can be drawn upon to
     gain access to the network. In some embodiments, the temporary service
     account is associated with a temporary credentials set. In some
     embodiments, the temporary service account is associated with a permanent
     credentials set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0476] In some embodiments, un-activated devices are detected by the
     network routing equipment (e.g., service gateways or routers in
     hierarchical networks or base stations with embedded gateways in flat
     networks) and the device routing is programmed to re-direct un-activated
     devices to an activation server network destination. For example, the
     activation server can first inspect the information associated with the
     device to determine if the device belongs to the list of devices, device
     types or device groups that the network is programmed to provide access
     to. For example, the information used to determine this can include
     device type, service provider, phone number, device ID, SIM ID or
     configuration, secure information used to qualify the device, IP address,
     MAC address, user, user group, VSP, OEM, device distributor, service
     distributor (master agent), service processor presence or configuration,
     presence or configuration of other software or hardware. There can also
     be some activation definition information embedded in the credentials, or
     associated with some portion of the credentials, or programmed
     additionally on the device that informs the activation server as to the
     service profile and/or service plan and/or service account that should be
     established for the device. If activation information (the service
     profile, service plan and/or service account information) is found
     through association with the device credentials (e.g., device ID, phone
     number, IP address, MAC address, SIM or other security credentials)
     rather than being read directly from information embedded in the device
     or device credentials, then the pertinent aspects of the credentials can
     be used as a cross reference to look up the service plan and/or service
     profile information stored in a database networked to or within the
     activation server. The activation information can include information to
     define a wide variety of service plans and service profiles that when
     properly implemented on the network functions, and perhaps device if
     necessary, can provide for a wide range of service activity policies,
     service billing policies, transaction billing policies and service
     account types that can be associated with the device over the air or over
     the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0477] In some embodiments, once the activation server has determined the
     activation information from the device or from a look up based on some
     aspect of the device credentials, then the activation server initiates
     the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be
     programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network
     provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions
     to the billing system. In some embodiments, the activation server can
     then also send the any necessary service profile and/or service plan
     settings required for the device to a provisioning and activation support
     software function on the device, such as various embodiments of the
     service processor, so that the device provisioning and activation can be
     completed. The provisioning can be with permanent credentials or
     temporary credentials, and the service account that is set up may be
     permanent or temporary. In some embodiments, the activation process
     described above is completed perhaps before the user has entered some or
     all of the user information necessary to set up a permanent service
     account, and, in these cases, a temporary service account can be set up.
     In some cases, the activation process can be completed in the background
     before the user has completed an attempt to access the network and the
     service profile can be set up to provide ambient services to a temporary
     service account. In some embodiments, the user is required to enter the
     information required to establish a permanent service account prior to
     gaining full use of the device, either on the device, on a computer or in
     the store, so that by the time the user begins using the device the above
     activation embodiments can provide for ambient services activation with
     permanent account status so that the user can purchase a service upgrade
     or any transaction without entering any more account information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0478] In some embodiments, a device status is changed from a temporary
     service account to a permanent service account. If the device is
     activated with a temporary service account, and the user information is
     available to set up a permanent account, then if the billing system rules
     and interfaces allow for such, the user information can be changed from
     the mock information to the actual user information while maintaining the
     same account identifiers in the billing system. If the billing system
     will not allow for such, then the user information can be used to
     establish a new account, the device credentials can be re-associated with
     the new account, in some cases, after modifying one or more of the device
     credential parameters, and the network functions can be re-programmed as
     required, and, in some cases, the device can be re-programmed as required
     to accommodate the new permanent account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0479] In some embodiments, code on the device pulls a temporary or
     permanent set of credentials. When the credentials are pulled, the
     network associates the device with an ambient service profile according
     to one or more of the following: embedded device information identifying
     device type, service owner (e.g., VSP), user group, or user, or device ID
     is cross referenced to a database that is populated some time from
     manufacturing time to post sale where the database provides information
     identifying device type, service owner (e.g., VSP), user group, or user.
     The device is then re-directed accordingly (e.g., for device based this
     is a matter of setting the policies or loading the software for the
     service processor, for the network based approach this is a matter of
     populating the routing tables and service profile). For example,
     credentials can be re-cycled after a period of time, and/or some portion
     of the credentials can be redundant with other devices. For example, this
     is essentially a dynamic service for (temporarily) assigning device
     credentials, and the duration of the temporary credential validity for
     that device ID can be time limited to give the user time to activate a
     real account or a free trial, session limited, or a longer duration of
     time that is perhaps refreshed each time the device logs on. For example,
     the device could also already have permanent or temporary credentials but
     not have a service account. The above process can be used to assign a
     temporary or permanent service account as well. Once the service account
     is assigned and the appropriate service profile is propagated to the
     network elements, the device can then be directed to or use the
     appropriate activation profile service activities or the appropriate
     ambient service activities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0480] In some embodiments, the device is activated in the background in a
     manner that is virtually transparent to the user. For example, at some
     point in the distribution channel, the device is programmed to seek the
     activation server system described above as soon as it is turned on, or
     as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the
     user attempting to gain access. When the pre-programmed event is
     triggered, the device connects to the network and the gateways or routers
     re-direct the device to an activation server, as discussed above. As also
     described herein, the activation server either derives information from
     the device that informs the server what service the device should be
     activated with, or the server derives that information from a database
     look up with a portion of the device credentials as the cross reference
     parameter. Once the activation server has determined the activation
     information from the device or from a look up based on some aspect of the
     device credentials, then the activation server causes all the necessary
     network settings and billing database entries to be configured/programmed
     by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning
     and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing
     system. In some embodiments, the activation server can then also send the
     any necessary service profile and/or service plan settings required for
     the device to a provisioning and activation support software function on
     the device, such as various embodiments of the service processor, so that
     the device provisioning and activation can be completed. For example, the
     provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials,
     and the service account that is set up can be permanent or temporary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0481] In some embodiments, background activation is performed using the
     aforementioned activate/suspend process. At some point in the
     distribution channel, the device is programmed to seek to resume service
     as soon as it is turned on, or as soon as some other event occurs like
     the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. When the
     pre-programmed event is triggered, the device attempts to connect to the
     network and the gateways or routers re-direct the device to an activation
     server as described herein. As also described herein, the activation
     server either derives information from the device that informs the server
     that the device is ready to resume service, or the server derives that
     information from a database look up with a portion of the device
     credentials as the cross reference parameter. Once the server is aware of
     this information, it sends a message to resume service to the billing
     system, or other network function that controls the suspend/resume
     function, and the service is resumed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0482] In some embodiments, background activation is performed as
     described below. The service processor and the credentials are
     pre-programmed during the manufacturing or distribution process to
     provide the desired service profile support and/or billing profile
     support for the desired initial ambient service. As described herein,
     this programming can be accomplished with dedicated apparatus at the
     manufacturer or distribution depot. Furthermore, the party responsible
     for defining the service (e.g., typically the central provider, OEM, VSP,
     distributor or master agent) can network into the service processor
     programming apparatus to control service processor and/or credential
     programming for all or a subset or group of the devices or device types
     locally available. The service processor enabled device is programmed to
     seek the activation server system described above as soon as it is turned
     on, or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device
     or the user attempting to gain access. In some embodiments, the
     activation server is the access control server previously discussed or
     the access control server can act in concert with another server that
     performs the activation function. When the pre-programmed event is
     triggered, the device connects to the network and the gateways or routers
     re-direct the device to the activation server. As also described herein,
     the activation server can communicate with the service processor to
     verify the service processor security credentials, agents and
     configuration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0483] In some embodiments, if the activation server determines that the
     pre-programmed settings stored in the service processor need to be
     modified to provide the latest version of the desired service, or if the
     service processor agent software needs to be updated, then this can be
     accomplished prior to completing the activation process. Once the service
     processor configuration and settings are confirmed, the activation server
     causes the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be
     programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network
     provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions
     to the billing system. Given that the service processor can perform some
     or much of the service activity control or control assistance, the
     service control options are generally larger than without the service
     processor, and there can be less configuration to perform for other
     networking equipment to complete the provisioning and activation process.
     The provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary
     credentials, and the service account that is set up can be permanent or
     temporary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0484] In some embodiments, pre-programming and pre-activation of devices
     with temporary credentials and a temporary service account are used to
     ship devices that are pre-activated. Given that the credentials are
     temporary and can be recycled when the permanent credentials are
     assigned, concerns about using up too many pre-assigned credentials are
     reduced. In embodiments in which a portion of credentials elements can be
     used for multiple devices, this concern is further reduced. If there is a
     concern about too many activated devices being assigned that are not
     actually active and generating service revenue, then the suspend/resume
     process discussed herein can be employed. In some embodiments, the
     temporary credentials and/or temporary account can be replaced with
     permanent credentials and/or account assignments at any time as follows.
     When a pre-programmed event in the device is triggered, then the device
     initiates a program that seeks the aforementioned activation server or
     another server that has the capability of fulfilling the device request
     to exchange the temporary credentials for permanent credentials and/or
     exchange the temporary account for a permanent account. The event that
     triggers the credential exchange can be the same or different than the
     event that triggers the service account exchange. The service account
     exchange can typically be triggered by the point in time that the user
     enters account information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0485] In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is partly
     implemented with a combination of the techniques for pre-provisioning
     during manufacturing or distribution and at least partially implementing
     the service activity control (e.g., access control, routing policy,
     traffic control, usage limits, and/or policy for usage limit overage)
     required for implementing ambient using the service policy provisioning
     capabilities in the data path gateways, routers or switches in the
     network. The gateways, router or switches are pre-programmed as discussed
     herein according to the ambient access profile for the device to
     implement the ambient policies for network access control, routing
     control, traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by
     account. In some embodiments, the provisioning credential elements are
     not all pre-programmed before the device ships, but a subset of the
     credential elements are programmed using the activation server technique
     discussed herein. This over the air automated provisioning is combined
     with the activation server reading the device credentials to derive the
     service activity control settings for the gateways, routers or switches
     that will result in the desired ambient services activity controls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0486] In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is
     implemented with a combination of the techniques for pre-activation
     during manufacturing or distribution and at least partially implementing
     the service activity control (e.g., access control, routing policy,
     traffic control, usage limits, and/or policy for usage limit overage)
     required for implementing ambient using the service policy control
     capabilities in the data path gateways, routers or switches in the
     network. The gateways, router or switches are programmed to recognize the
     pre-activated device credentials as discussed herein according to the
     ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies
     for network access control, routing control, traffic control or service
     monitoring and reporting for bill by account. In some embodiments, the
     device activation profile and/or service account are not pre-programmed
     in the network and/or the device before the device ships but the
     activation profile and/or service account are programmed using the
     activation server technique discussed herein. This over the air automated
     provisioning is combined with the activation server reading the device
     credentials to derive the service profile activity control settings for
     the gateways, routers or switches that results in the desired ambient
     services activity controls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0487] In some embodiment, a VSP capability is enabled by providing a
     secure network connection to the service policy settings tools that
     define the device pre-provisioning settings, the device pre-activation
     service profile settings, the network equipment service activity control
     policy settings (e.g., access control, routing policy, traffic control,
     usage limits, and/or policy for usage limit overage), and the network
     billing system database. By providing server tools that enable all these
     settings to be controlled (or perhaps only observed in the case of the
     billing system) by a secure workstation or secure website interface that
     networks into the equipment that programs the settings, and providing for
     a secure partitioning of the devices that can be controlled by a given
     secure workstation or secure website interface, a central provider can
     provide VSP services to multiple entities who all have different device
     and service plan combinations that they desire different flavors of
     ambient services for. These techniques can also be extended beyond
     ambient to any device/service profile/service plan combo the VSP desires
     to create. In some embodiments, the networking equipment is implemented
     to secure device service group domains in which the service policies for
     a group of devices can be controlled. In some embodiments, the
     pre-provisioning and pre-activation techniques are substituted with the
     over the air activation server techniques discussed herein, and a secure
     device group partition capability is provided in the activation server as
     well so that the activation server device group partition control
     capabilities can be added to the secure device group partition control
     capabilities of the network gateways, routers and/or switches, the device
     programming tools and the billing system to form a VSP partition solution
     for over the air activation of various device/service plan combinations.
     In some embodiments, the device groups are relatively small so that beta
     trials of arbitrarily large or small size can be designed and implemented
     by defining a service control group as described above, and after fine
     tuning and perfecting the beta trial settings the device group can be
     expanded to publish the automated provisioning and activation service
     settings to a larger user or device group for production services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0488] In some embodiments, device based service activity control
     assistance (e.g., based on the various service processor embodiments
     described herein) is combined with simplified provisioning techniques
     described herein so that service processor enabled devices can be shipped
     with pre-provisioned credentials (temporary or permanent) or can obtain
     credentials in an automated manner that is convenient and efficient for
     the user or device owner. In some embodiments, the service processor
     embodiments in combination with the manufacturing and supply chain
     credentials and provisioning apparatus described elsewhere provide
     various approaches for provisioning pre-provisioned service processor
     enabled devices. In some embodiments, the service processor embodiments
     in combination with the activation server variants discussed above
     provide various approaches for over the air or over the network
     simplified post-sale provisioning for service processor enabled devices.
     For example, these embodiments can also be used for ambient services
     given that as discussed herein the service processor has capability to
     implement service profile policies for deep control of ambient service
     activity control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0489] In some embodiments, provisioning includes provisioning partial
     device credentials that include, for example, a secure certificate that
     is used to authorize full credential provisioning and/or activation by
     performing a process for a later look-up/validation of the full device
     credentials. For example, the look-up/validation of the full device
     credentials can be performed by a gateway, router or similar network
     device that re-directs to a provisioning server and/or activation server
     or other network components that either: (1) recognizes the partial
     credentials that serve as a reference to direct the device communication
     to a specific provisioning/activation server determined from the partial
     credentials; or (2) does not recognize the partial credentials, and
     directs the device communication to a less specific
     provisioning/activation server that is not necessarily associated with a
     reference to the partial credentials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0490] In some embodiments, if the partial device credentials (e.g.,
     temporary or permanent credentials) are being used for provisioning, then
     the partial credentials are read (e.g., and/or other credentials can be
     looked up based on the partial credentials as described above). The
     device is authorized if the proper credentials and/or secure certificate
     is present. The device credential provisioning is then completed (e.g.,
     using activation server commands or settings to a device based software
     and/or hardware element), and the credentials are, in some cases, also
     communicated to the various network equipment elements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0491] In some embodiments, if the partial device credentials are being
     used for activation, then partial or full device credential provisioning
     is performed, such as described above. A service account (e.g., temporary
     or permanent service account) is created or looked up based on the
     partial device credentials (e.g., a user account associated with the
     device through embedded partial or full credentials or a look up process,
     or based on a dynamically created/assigned temporary account associated
     with the device through embedded partial or full credentials). An initial
     service profile and, in some cases, an initial service plan (e.g.,
     service control policy settings including a billing profile) are
     determined from embedded information and/or using a look up process
     (e.g., based on the device type and/or partial or full device
     credentials). The device is then programmed to enable access with the
     service profile and plan, and, in some cases, the various network
     components/elements are programmed to enable the service profile and
     plan, and, in some cases, proper entries in the billing system are made
     or confirmed, and the device credentials are, thus, activated for
     service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0492] In some embodiments, the above described provisioning and/or
     activation processes are performed with the provisioning server(s) and/or
     activation server(s) in the background with reduced, minimal or no user
     input required, for example, after the device is sold to the user and the
     user turns on the device so that by the time the user attempts to access
     the service using the device, the provisioning and/or activation process
     is already completed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0493] In some embodiments, device based service activity control
     assistance (e.g., based on the service processor embodiments) is combined
     with simplified activation techniques described herein so that service
     processor enabled devices can be shipped with pre-activated accounts
     (temporary or permanent), or can obtain activated account status in an
     automated manner that is convenient and efficient for the user or device
     owner. In some embodiments, the service processor embodiments in
     combination with the manufacturing and supply chain activation and
     provisioning apparatus described elsewhere provide various approaches for
     pre-activated service processor enabled devices. In some embodiments, the
     service processor embodiments in combination with the activation server
     variants discussed above provide various approaches for over the air or
     over the network simplified post-sale account activation for service
     processor enabled devices. These embodiments can also be used for ambient
     services given that as discussed herein the service processor has
     capability to implement service profile policies for deep control of
     ambient service activity control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0494] As discussed herein, in some embodiments for activation, the
     network AAA (or other network function) either recognizes one or more
     aspects of a pre-activated device credentials and routes the
     pre-activated device communication to an activation server that is
     appropriate for that device (routing information either derived through
     look up of the credential aspect or by obtaining the required information
     directly from the credential itself), or the AAA (or other network
     function) does not recognize the credentials and routes the device
     communication to an activation server for unrecognized device
     credentials. In either case, in some embodiments, one or more of the
     credential aspects can then be used to perform a secondary determination
     of what provisioning and/or activation sequence to perform in association
     with the device, or which activation server sequence the device should be
     directed to. For example, one or more device credential aspects can be
     read and used as a cross-reference to determine a routing for the device
     communication (or the information required for routing can be in the
     device credential information itself) so that the device can be routed to
     the appropriate activation server sequence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0495] In some embodiments, an activation server sequence can be
     determined at least in part by using a browser server or a portal (e.g.,
     http server, https server, WAP server or another standard or custom
     protocol server for a browser, embedded or automated browser or a portal
     client in the device). In some embodiments, the browser server is an http
     or https server. The pre-activated device communication can be routed to
     the https server in a manner similar to that described above, and the
     server can read the information embedded in the https communication to
     determine the device credential information required to initiate the
     correct provisioning completion and/or activation sequences. For example,
     the https header information, tokens, cookies or other secure information
     communicated over https from a secure embedded client on the device (or
     user) can either provide the activation server with the information
     required to perform the cross-reference to an appropriate provisioning
     and/or activation sequence, or the https embedded information or the
     embedded client (or user) information can instruct the activation server
     on which services the device is to be provisioned and/or activated on and
     any necessary device or user information (e.g., device owner and/or
     billing information) can be exchanged, or the device might be provisioned
     and/or activated first on a free ambient service with temporary or
     permanent credentials or account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0496] In some embodiments, the service processor can be combined with the
     pre-provisioning and pre-activation techniques described above to create
     an ambient service solution that will work on roaming networks in which
     the central provider or VSP has no control or minimal control over the
     network elements. For example, the device includes a service processor
     pre-programmed for ambient service activity control as discussed herein,
     and the device credentials and other settings are pre-provisioned and
     pre-activated for the central provider network, all of which is described
     in numerous embodiments disclosed herein. Provided that the service
     provider has a roaming agreement with other service providers, or
     provided that the device may gain access to the roaming network, when the
     device is roaming it will be capable of ambient connectivity with bill by
     account functionality and all the other features of ambient. Furthermore,
     as also discussed herein, the ambient service activity control policies
     can be different for different roaming networks to accommodate the
     varying network costs and performance. Also, for example, it would be
     permissible to sign up for initial services or additional upgrade
     services with the central provider while roaming on the roaming partner
     network. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this also
     allows for creating a VSP or MVNO for the purpose of creating a clearing
     house for central provider service activations according to geography or
     user choice. By using a global multi-mode modem module, and maintaining
     service agreements with a multitude of carriers, the MVNO or VSP can
     provide consistent ambient services across multiple carriers and multiple
     geographies while still maintaining a good degree of cost control. Using
     bill by account capabilities, it is also possible to have an activation
     agreement where a roaming service provider agrees to refund the cost of
     ambient roaming. From the ambient service platform, the VSP or MVNO can
     then provide service purchase options to the user based on the carrier
     networks available to the device, or the VSP or MVNO can broker the user
     off to any of the carriers by activating the device onto the carriers
     main central provider service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0497] Accordingly, these embodiments provide flexible capabilities for
     activating a device or group of devices with a broad range of service
     profiles and service plans by simply programming the device with the
     proper credentials at some time during manufacturing or distribution, or
     simply programming a database associated with the network so that a
     portion of the device credentials can be used to look up the desired
     service profile and service plan. For example, various activation
     embodiments described herein are highly convenient for the end user and
     need not, in many cases, involve any human intervention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0498] The service processor 115, service controller 122, policy
     implementation and/or profile implementation and various embodiments
     disclosed herein are applicable to conventional communication products as
     well as machine to machine applications. For example, if the machine to
     machine device includes a service processor 115 with an activated
     account, then the service profile settings can be optimized for machine
     communications to provide only the limited access required to support the
     particular machine to machine application. This allows for cost optimized
     access services and prevents the machine to machine device or access
     modem from being misappropriated and used for some other service access
     than that intended. For example, by programming the machine to machine
     communications device at time of manufacture or during distribution with
     credentials or partial credentials that provide for automated
     provisioning and activation as described herein, the device can be
     automatically provisioned and activated on the service network with a
     service account when deployed, thus eliminating the need for costly or
     time consuming human intervention. The various embodiments that make it
     simpler to design, manufacture, test and deploy devices may also be
     equally applied to machine to machine devices. These embodiments include
     the service processor 115 developers kit and the automated provisioning
     and activation management tools among others. Also, the service analysis
     and test tools and the virtual service provider embodiments can also be
     applied to machine to machine applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verifiable Device Assisted Services for Intermediate Networking Devices
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0499] It should be appreciated that the various service monitoring,
     notification, control and billing embodiments disclosed herein can also
     be applied to intermediate networking device applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0500] In some embodiments, an intermediate networking device is a
     communications device in which the service processor 115 is configured at
     least in part to allow the intermediate networking device to act as a
     service intermediary or intermediate connection between the network and
     one or more end point devices (e.g., communications devices). In
     addition, a service controller 122 or other suitable network functions
     can be employed to assist with the verifiable service usage monitoring,
     control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments described
     herein. In some embodiments, an intermediate networking device does this
     by implementing the service policies required for assisting service usage
     control of the intermediate networking device and connecting the network
     to provide services to one or more end point devices that are connected
     to the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments, the
     intermediate networking device also monitors the service use activities
     of the intermediate networking device and/or the end point devices
     connected to the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments, the
     intermediate networking device and/or end point device service usage is
     verified to ensure that the service usage is within the expected ranges
     for the policies that are implemented. In some embodiments, the
     intermediate networking device connects with the network using one modem
     technology and connects with the end point devices using one or more
     additional technologies. In some embodiments, an intermediate networking
     device connects the end point devices to the network by passing,
     bridging, forwarding, routing, traffic shaping or otherwise allowing the
     end point devices to communicate with the network. Example intermediate
     networking device embodiments include a Wi-Fi to WWAN (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G
     or other wireless wide area networking access technology) bridge or
     router device, a Wi-Fi to DSL, cable or fiber gateway device, a WWAN to
     DSL or Cable femto cell device, a WWAN and Wi-Fi to DSL, Cable or fiber
     back-hauled femto cell device, a WWAN to WWAN router device, a WWAN to
     WLAN, WPAN or LAN bridge, router or gateway device, or a WWAN back up
     connection device for an enterprise router.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0501] An intermediate networking device can also be provided in some
     embodiments by including a bridging, forwarding or routing function
     between two modems in a communications enabled device that connects to
     the network. For example, an intermediate networking device configuration
     can be a cell phone, smart phone, mobile internet device or any other
     mobile device that includes a WWAN modem and a Wi-Fi, WLAN, WPAN or LAN
     connection that can be used to connect to other end point devices. For
     example, the mobile device WWAN modem can connect to the network, a
     service processor 115 can be included on the device processor to assist
     monitoring, controlling and billing for services between the WWAN network
     and end point devices connected to a Wi-Fi modem. In addition, a service
     controller 122 or other suitable network functions can be employed to
     assist with verifiable service usage monitoring, control and verification
     as disclosed in numerous embodiments disclosed throughout herein. In some
     embodiments, the Wi-Fi modem can be configured in access point mode or in
     ad hoc mode to communicate with other end point devices in the area
     covered by the mobile device WLAN modem. In this manner, a service
     processor 115 and a service controller 122 or other suitable network
     functions can be employed to enable the verifiable service usage
     monitoring, control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments
     described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0502] Another example embodiment is a notebook or sub-notebook computer
     with a WWAN modem and a Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Firewire, Bluetooth, near field
     or Zigbee modem in which the notebook processor has a service processor
     115 running on the notebook processor and the service processor 115 is
     used to assist monitoring, control and billing for services communicated
     between the WWAN network and end point devices connected to the notebook
     or sub-notebook WLAN, LAN or WPAN. Another example embodiment is a Wi-Fi
     hot spot with a service processor 115 capability. Another example
     embodiment is a WWAN back up modem in an access network router where the
     back up modem connection to the WWAN network is used when the main wired
     network connection goes down, and a router processor or a WWAN back up
     modem processor runs a service processor 115 to assist monitoring,
     controlling and billing for services between the WWAN network and the
     access router (e.g., the service provider may only wish to enable a
     connection when the main wired network is down to ensure that the WWAN
     modem is not used for everyday access). In this manner, a service
     processor 115 and a service controller 122 or other suitable network
     functions can be employed to enable the verifiable service usage
     monitoring, control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments
     described herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0503] Another example embodiment is a two-way home gateway configured to
     perform various functions such as reading power consumption of the home
     and/or components in the home, providing WLAN, WPAN or LAN connectivity
     for such components or to the power meters/controllers attached to such
     components, providing a WWAN or WAN connection to a network that reads,
     records, monitors and/or controls the home and/or component power
     consumption, and possibly to provide other wide area network services for
     other devices in the home such as computers or entertainment electronics
     in a similar manner to the WWAN, DSL, cable and fiber gateway
     embodiments. The WLAN, WPAN connections can be made with one or more of
     Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, NFC or any other suitable wireless modem
     technology, and any desired wired LAN connections may be made with one or
     more of Ethernet, USB, Firewire, data over cable, data over power line or
     any other suitable wired modem technology. The WWAN connections can be
     made with one or more of 2G (e.g. CDMA 1xRT, GPRS), 3G (e.g. WCDMA
     UMTS/HSPA/non-MIMO HSPA+, CDMA EVDOrA/B, 802.16d/e WiMax), 4G (e.g. LTE,
     MIMO HSPA+, MIMO 802.16m WiMax) or any other suitable modem technologies
     and the wired WAN connections may be made with one or more of DSL, Cable,
     fiber or any other wired modem technology. A service processor 115 and a
     service controller 122 or other suitable network functions can be
     employed to enable the verifiable service usage monitoring, control and
     verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments disclosed throughout
     herein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0504] In some embodiments, an intermediate networking device can be used
     to connect one end point device to a network and assist in implementing
     service policies, or an intermediate networking device can connect
     multiple end point devices to one or more networks and assist in
     implementing service policies. In some embodiments, an intermediate
     networking device can be associated with one service profile, one service
     plan or one service account, or an intermediate networking device can be
     associated with multiple service profiles, multiple service plans or
     multiple service accounts. In some embodiments, end point devices
     connected to an intermediate networking device can have service usage
     policies implemented in aggregate for all end point devices, or service
     policies can be implemented differentially for different end point
     devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0505] In some embodiments, an intermediate networking device can have a
     network connection associated with a single account and manage QOS
     between end point devices under one umbrella service profile or
     collection of profiles. In some embodiments, an intermediate networking
     device can treat all connected end point devices equally from a service
     sharing or QOS perspective so that, for example, service usage is based
     on end point device demand and/or contention. In some embodiments, an
     intermediate networking device differentiates service QOS between
     different end point devices based on end point device service demand or
     service usage patterns, EDP device type or device group, end point device
     user or user group, end point device service account status or service
     plan status, or end point device application type, and/or traffic type or
     service type.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0506] As discussed herein, the service processor 115 function assisting
     intermediate networking device implementation can be included on the
     intermediate networking device, can be included in part on the
     intermediate networking device and one or more end point devices, or can
     be implemented mainly or entirely on one or more end point devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0507] In some embodiments, an intermediate networking device can be
     constructed in which end point devices connect to the intermediate
     networking device and gain access services to a WWAN network through a
     WWAN/Wi-Fi enabled intermediate networking device that is supplied with
     services associated with a single account and service profile. The
     intermediate networking device service processor 115 can assist in
     monitoring, control and billing for WWAN service usage for all end point
     devices in the area covered by the intermediate networking device Wi-Fi
     link. In some embodiments, end point devices receive service on first
     come first serve basis with no differentiation. In some embodiments, end
     point devices receive fair distribution of services so that if one end
     point device is using more significantly more service than the other end
     point devices, or is demanding more service than the intermediate
     networking device service profile settings provide for a single end point
     device (e.g., "bandwidth hogging"), then the high demand end point device
     is throttled and the other end point devices are not. In some
     embodiments, end point devices receive hierarchical distribution of
     services based on one or more of service type, device type, user type,
     and/or account status. In some embodiments, an intermediate networking
     device can provide for a large or unlimited number of end point devices
     to connect to the network and simply control aggregate service usage
     parameters for the intermediate networking device WWAN connection. In
     some embodiments, the intermediate networking device limits the number of
     end point devices that are allowed to connect to the WWAN network
     according the end point device count limits programmed in the service
     processor 115 service profile settings in the intermediate networking
     device. In some embodiments, end point device traffic can be identified
     by various end point device credential aspects including, for example, by
     Wi-Fi ID, MAC ID, IP address, user ID, LAN tag, end point device agent
     credentials, and/or browser token or cookie. In some embodiments, the
     intermediate networking device service account can be billed for overall
     service usage and/or by number of end point device connections allowed or
     experienced. In some embodiments, as the intermediate networking device
     user or owner signs up for a higher end point device connection count,
     one ore more aspects of the service usage policy implementation and/or
     profile implementations in the service processor 115 profile settings can
     be increased.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0508] The various verification techniques described herein can also be
     applied to the intermediate networking device and extended to multiple
     end point devices. For example, network based service usage measures for
     verification can be applied to the intermediate networking device just as
     if the intermediate networking device were an end point device. For
     example, network based service usage measures (e.g., IPDR information)
     can be used to perform network verification checks to ensure that
     intermediate networking device service usage is within acceptable ranges
     based on intermediate networking device policy settings as similarly
     described with respect to various device embodiments. In some
     embodiments, in the event intermediate networking device service usage is
     outside the policy limits set for the intermediate networking device
     service processor 115, a notification can be sent to the intermediate
     networking device main account owner. The main intermediate networking
     device account owner can also be required to acknowledge the
     notification. The notification can also be sent to one or more other
     users of the intermediate networking device connection, including
     possibly all users. Other actions that can be taken if the network based
     intermediate networking device service usage measure does not match the
     policy limits set on the service processor 115 include notify the user,
     notify the user and require acknowledgement, bill the user for service
     overage, suspend the end point device, quarantine the end point device,
     SPAN the end point device, and/or alert network manager or alert an
     automated network troubleshooting function. In some embodiments, a device
     based usage measure can be verified against a network based service usage
     measure. It will now be apparent that the various service processor 115
     verification embodiments, service controller 122 verification
     embodiments, network verification embodiments, authentication
     embodiments, and tamper prevention or detection embodiments, such as
     those shown in and described with respect to FIGS. 22A, 22B, 23, 26A-26H,
     27A-27P and 28A-28E, can be applied to intermediate networking device
     applications and embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0509] In some embodiments, it is desirable to match up individual end
     point device or user intermediate networking device service usage with
     other service usage measures. For example, the individual end point
     device service usage measures logged or reported from the end point
     devices and/or the intermediate networking device can be aggregated to
     form a total intermediate networking device usage measure that is
     compared to an aggregate intermediate networking device usage measure
     logged or reported in the network. In some embodiments, if these measures
     do not match, then an error condition results and an action is taken. In
     some embodiments, the aggregate intermediate networking device service
     usage measure is compared to the aggregate network based service usage
     measure and as long as these two measures are within an acceptable
     tolerance, then the intermediate networking device service usage measures
     are trusted and can be used for deeper intermediate networking device and
     end point device usage measures for service control and/or billing than
     may be possible in the network. In such embodiments, the individual end
     point device service usage measures gained from the intermediate
     networking device or end point device can be used to verify end point
     device service usage versus service policy allowances. In some
     embodiments, end point device service usage measures are compared with
     intermediate networking device measures for the same end point devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0510] In some embodiments, the IPDR records for one or more networks can
     include individual end point device service usage information. This is
     the case for example when the IPDRs include information broken down by
     end point device credential, such as IP address or other end point device
     credential. In such cases, intermediate networking device embodiments can
     be employed in which the individual end point device service usage
     information measured in the network can be compared with the service
     usage policy allowances or limits for the end point device. Also, in some
     embodiments, the individual end point device service usage measures from
     an end point device service usage monitor and/or an intermediate
     networking device service usage monitor can be compared with the network
     based service usage information to verify an end point device and/or an
     intermediate networking device service usage monitor is operating
     properly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0511] As similarly described with respect to end point device embodiments
     with no intermediate networking device between the end point device and
     the network, in some intermediate networking device embodiments, service
     usage and service usage monitor reports can be periodically verified by
     performing a SPAN function on the traffic for an intermediate networking
     device. The SPAN traffic can be analyzed in a real-time manner or in a
     non-real-time manner in the network and the results can be compared with
     the intermediate networking device or end point device service policies
     or service usage measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0512] The synchronized device notification and acknowledgement
     embodiments can also be employed in the case in which one service account
     is applied to the intermediate networking device. The service usage
     counters in the intermediate networking device can be synchronized or
     updated with the network based measures and the differences between the
     two may be minimized. The service usage notification can be sent to one
     or more of the end point devices connected to the intermediate networking
     device. For example, the notification can be sent to the intermediate
     networking device manager or service owner, all end point devices or the
     most active end point devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0513] Similarly, user preference feedback can be collected from one or
     more of the service users connected to the intermediate networking
     device. In some embodiments, user preferences or user service selections
     or service settings are collected from one user or a subset of end point
     devices used by the service subscriber. In some embodiments, more than
     one service user can provide preference information or service settings
     even if there is only one user account. In some embodiments, there are
     multiple service subscribers each providing preferences. In some
     embodiments, as similarly described with respect to various device
     embodiments, user preferences can be used set service control policies
     that provide the user with their selected balance of cost and service
     capability in a manner that meets network neutrality requirements.
     Similarly, in some embodiments, the service monitoring and customer
     resource management information collected on the intermediate networking
     device or end point devices can be filtered according to user privacy
     preferences to maintain the level of user privacy selected by the user.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0514] Adaptive intermediate networking device policy implementation can
     also be performed in the intermediate networking device service processor
     115 embodiments, as similarly described with respect to various device
     embodiments. In some embodiments, the service policy implementation for
     the intermediate networking device can be adapted by the service
     processor 115 agents (e.g., policy control agent 1692 working to control
     the settings in policy implementation agent 1690, and/or another service
     processor agent or function) to achieve a higher level service usage
     goal. In some embodiments, the usage goals or adaptation can be based on
     aggregate end point device usage for the intermediate networking device
     network services, and in some embodiments, the higher level usage goals
     or adaptation can apply to one or more individual end point devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0515] In some embodiments, even though there is one intermediate
     networking device account, there can be multiple options for multi-end
     point device or multi-user operation in which the number of end point
     devices, number of users or service capabilities for some of the end
     point devices or users are selectable. These parameters are accommodated
     by an intermediate networking device service profile that includes the
     service capabilities that are to be delivered to a multitude of end point
     devices or users. In some cases, some end point devices or users have a
     different profile within the intermediate networking device service
     processor 115 with differentiated capabilities as compared to the
     intermediate networking device service processor 115 profile for other
     end point devices or users. This is the case for some of the examples
     provided herein. These multi-end point device or multi-user service
     profiles in the intermediate networking device service processor 115 can
     share services equally or can allow more capable access services to some
     end point devices or users than others. In some embodiments, a service
     profile implemented by the intermediate networking device service
     processor 115 for one end point device or user is different than that in
     the service profile implemented by the service processor 115 for another
     end point device or user (e.g., providing differentiated service profile
     implementations by end point devices and/or users). End point devices can
     be uniquely identified for purposes involving implementation of different
     service profiles in the intermediate networking device service processor
     115 agents (e.g., depending on the embodiment, service monitor agent
     1696, policy implementation agent 1690, policy control agent 1692,
     application interface agent 1693 and/or other service processor agents or
     functions) based on a number of parameters, such as IP address, local
     area network address (e.g., Wi-Fi address), MAC address end point device
     ID, user ID, and/or end point device application layer tag. This allows
     for independent service usage monitoring and control for different end
     point devices or users.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0516] In some embodiments, an intermediate networking device also bridges
     services to end point devices or users that have individually managed
     service profiles, service plans or service accounts. As discussed herein,
     individual end point device service policy implementation and/or service
     profile implementation can be accomplished by classifying end point
     device service usage according to an end point device identifier so that
     service monitoring, control assistance and reporting may be
     differentiated between one or more end point devices. These end point
     device identifiers can then be associated with a different service plan
     or account in the service processor 115 and/or billing system 123. The
     end point device or user specific service usage monitoring, reporting,
     notification and control assistance can be accomplished by running one or
     more profiles for each end point device or each user.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0517] It will now be apparent that billing can also be implemented with a
     single account encompassing service usage for all users or end point
     devices connected to an intermediate networking device, or for individual
     users, end point devices, user groups or end point device groups
     connected to an intermediate networking device. As similarly described
     with respect to the service profile, this is accomplished by associating
     service usage events and associated billing events with an end point
     device identifier, user identifier, end point device group identifier,
     and/or user group identifier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0518] In some embodiments, end point devices or users connect to more
     than one intermediate networking device with the same service account,
     service plan or service profile. In some embodiments, the intermediate
     networking device requires an authentication sequence for the end point
     device or user before allowing connection to the network through the
     intermediate networking device. This authentication sequence can involve
     the end point device communicating an active account or admission
     credential with the intermediate networking device. The intermediate
     networking device can compare the credential with a local database or may
     query a database in the network to admit the end point device to the
     intermediate networking device network connection. In either case,
     provided the user credential or network authorization process is passed,
     the service processor 115 service profile settings for the end point
     device are applied and service is then established as discussed herein.
     In these cases, the verification can be accomplished as described herein.
     In some embodiments, even if the end point device does not have a service
     processor 115, provided that the intermediate networking device service
     policy implementations and/or service profile implementations are
     verified as described herein, then the intermediate networking device
     will accurately assist in control and reporting of service usage for the
     different end point devices or users, and the appropriate service policy
     controls and/or billing can be maintained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0519] In some embodiments, when the end point device attempts connection
     to the intermediate networking device, if the user or end point device
     does not already have an active account or logon credential that the
     intermediate networking device recognizes, then the intermediate
     networking device can offer the end point device or user a service sign
     up experience. This experience can be implemented in a number of ways,
     including a website, WAP site, portal, download of agent software, and
     other methods. For example, an automated recognition of new devices can
     redirect unauthorized end point devices to browse into a website, WAP
     site, or portal site located on the intermediate networking device or in
     the network. If the site is located on the intermediate networking
     device, it can be cached and refreshed at a time of day when the network
     is not overly busy. Once on the site, the user or end point device
     selects the plan choice they desire, inputs account information and, in
     some embodiments, downloads device agent software to aid in network
     service policy implementation and/or profile implementation with the
     intermediate networking device. Once the user signs up, the information
     is logged into the network data base, the service account is established
     and the intermediate networking device service profile for that user or
     end point device is activated and the user can begin using the service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0520] In some embodiments, a website, WAP site, or portal site located in
     the intermediate networking device can be used to provide the end point
     device user with a service usage monitor interface and a service purchase
     interface for cases in which the end point device does not posses any
     special software to allow it to display a more specialized service usage
     monitor function for information received from the intermediate
     networking device or network service usage counters. The service usage
     monitor for the intermediate networking device can be synchronized, as
     similarly described with respect to various device embodiments. In some
     embodiments, the service usage notification system can also display cost
     data from a usage to cost look-up function. In some embodiments, the
     service usage notification system can display projected service usage or
     projected cost, as similarly described with respect to various device
     embodiments. The service usage monitor to drive these service
     notification embodiments can be located on one or more of the end point
     device, the intermediate networking device or the network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0521] In some embodiments, if multiple accounts are serviced by one or
     more intermediate networking devices, verification can be performed on
     the service controls for the end point device or user service usage. As
     will now be apparent, just as with the intermediate networking device,
     the end point device or user service usage comparison with usage policy
     settings can be verified in the ways described herein. If the usage is
     found to be out of policy, then any of the out of policy actions
     described herein can be performed, including, for example, notify the end
     user, notify and require acknowledgement, bill for overage, suspend,
     quarantine, SPAN, and/or flag to network manager or network error
     handling function. For example, the verification methods shown in and
     described with respect to FIGS. 22A, 22B, 23, 26A-26H, 27A-27P and
     28A-28E can be applied for the embodiments where intermediate networking
     devices have multiple account, multiple service plan, multiple service
     profile, multiple end point device, and/or multiple user capabilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0522] It will be apparent that the various embodiments described herein
     for automated provisioning and activation also can similarly be applied
     to the intermediate networking device embodiments. It will also be
     apparent that the various virtual service provider embodiments can
     similarly be applied to the intermediate networking device embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0523] Ambient services can be employed on the intermediate networking
     device and the ambient services can thus be provided to the end point
     devices. It will be apparent that the ambient service profile embodiments
     disclosed herein can similarly be applied to the intermediate networking
     device, and then the intermediate networking device can supply those
     ambient services to end point devices connected to the intermediate
     networking device. It will also be apparent that the intermediate
     networking device can provide an ambient service profile as described
     herein to end point devices or users that have not yet signed up for
     service, while providing other paid for service profiles to end point
     devices or users that have signed up for service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0524] Bill by account embodiments can similarly be applied to the
     intermediate networking device embodiments. For example, bill by account
     can be used in embodiments in which all end point devices or users are
     connected to the intermediate networking device under one account, or to
     embodiments in which some end point devices or users are accounted for
     separately with different service accounts, service plans or service
     profiles. In either case, it will be apparent that using one or more of
     the end point device or user identification credential aspects discussed
     herein can be used in a bill by account profile to account for any end
     point device or service activity. In such embodiments, billing event
     reports for those activities that include the end point device or user
     identifiers can also be provided for billing mediation and reconciliation
     down to the individual end point device or user level. For example, this
     allows for very deep service monitoring and billing capabilities with
     intermediate networking devices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0525] The intermediate networking device embodiments described above also
     have uses in machine to machine applications. It will be apparent that if
     the end point device includes the correct credentials to gain access to
     an existing account, or to allow an automated provisioning and activation
     account to be established, then the end point device can be connected to
     the network through the intermediate networking device without human
     intervention. Furthermore, the service profile that is established with
     the end point device for machine to machine communications can be set up
     to provide the access required to support the machine to machine
     application allowing for low cost access services and preventing the end
     point device from being misused for some service other than that
     intended. For example, the verification techniques and embodiments
     disclosed herein can similarly be applied to such machine to machine
     applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0526] It will be apparent that the identifiers discussed above for bill
     by account mediation with accounting down to the individual end point
     device or user level can be combined with a billing mediation server in
     the network that accepts intermediate networking device billing events
     with end point device identification or user identification indexed
     billing, performs the necessary bill by account mediation functions,
     formats the billing events into the format used by the billing system,
     and transmits the mediated billing information to the billing system 123.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0527] In some embodiments, the intermediate networking device service
     processor 115 functionality can be split. The division ranges from some
     or all of the service processor 115 on the device to some or all of the
     service processor 115 on the intermediate networking device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0528] In some embodiments, all of the service processor 115 is on the
     intermediate networking device. The end point device does not participate
     in service processor 115 functions and has no service processor 115
     interface software. In some embodiments, the end point device has small
     subset of service processor 115 capabilities, including, for example, a
     service notification UI or a logon client with credentials. In some
     embodiments, service monitoring is implemented on the end point device or
     on both the end point device and in the intermediate networking device.
     In some embodiments, the end point device has additional service
     processor 115 capabilities including, for example, application layer
     tagging that associates application layer activity with service processor
     115 service monitoring or service policy implementation and/or service
     profile implementation information. This can be accomplished by a range
     of techniques, for example, transmitting the application tagging
     information disclosed elsewhere to the intermediate networking device
     service processor 115 so that the policy implementation may be
     accomplished with knowledge of the application layer information. Another
     example involves assigning IP addresses in the intermediate networking
     device networking stack to the end point devices so that different types
     of end point device traffic can be routed into service processor 115
     traffic shaping queues, each queue having a policy profile implementation
     engine, and application layer tagging information or similar traffic
     identifying information is used to determine which policy implementation
     engine the traffic should be routed to in order to accomplish the desired
     traffic shaping for the traffic type, application type, service type,
     and/or content type. In some embodiments, the traffic control policy is
     implemented on the end point device either with an application layer
     traffic controller, or by implementing more of the service processor 115
     functionality, as similarly described with respect to various device
     embodiments. In the end point device service functionality example, most
     or all of the service processor 115 functionality is implemented on the
     end point device and the intermediate networking device functionality can
     be reduced to a bridging, forwarding or routing function between the end
     point devices and the network that performs little or no service control,
     monitoring and/or billing functions. For example, the service usage
     monitoring agents can also be provided on the end point device to aid in
     verification.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0529] In embodiments in which the end point device requires agent
     software, the software can be loaded at time of manufacture or during
     distribution, loaded later, and/or made available for download through
     the intermediate networking device. In the case in which the end point
     device agent SW is downloaded through the end point device, there can be
     locally cached copies of the SW for one or more OS variants stored in a
     cache on the intermediate networking device, with the cache being updated
     over the network at convenient or conducive times, or the software can be
     downloaded live over the network when it is needed by the end point
     device. Logging the service usage to download this software is another
     example in which bill by account functionality can be used to track
     network traffic that may not be desirable to bill to an end point device
     owner or user, and bill by account functionality can be used to log and
     mediate such usage out of the user or end point device owner's bill.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0530] Any end point device agent software required to connect to the
     intermediate networking device can also be implemented as a service
     processor 115 developer's kit as described herein and distributed to aid
     manufacturers, service provider and virtual service providers in bringing
     new devices onto networks with intermediate networking device capability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0531] In the case of a femto cell intermediate networking device, in some
     embodiments, it is desirable to facilitate handover from the WWAN network
     to the femto cell. In some embodiments, this provided in the intermediate
     networking device service processor 115 in a variety of ways. In some
     embodiments, the voice and data traffic is routed through a VPN tunnel
     controlled by the service processor 115 and connected to a network
     element, such as the transport gateway or another specified traffic
     concentration destination for the femto cell. In some embodiments, the
     voice traffic, the data traffic or both can be routed in secure or open
     Internet channels to different destinations, or the data can be routed
     directly to the Internet destination specified by the packets. In some
     embodiments, the femto cell intermediate networking device controls the
     femto cell frequencies or local frequency channel strength surveys over
     the intermediate networking device control channel. In some embodiments,
     the service processor 115 has a VPN connection to a network base station
     hand off controller to assist in handoff to and from the WWAN network
     and/or has the capability to instruct the end point device and the base
     station handoff controller. In some embodiment, whenever an end point
     device authenticated for femto cell access is within range of the femto
     cell, the service provider desires to set up a service processor 115
     profile to get the end point device to connect to the femto cell even if
     it has a strong signal with one or more WWAN base stations so that the
     WWAN traffic may be offloaded. In some embodiments, the service processor
     115 can form a secure control plane link with network AAA functions to
     manage authorization and admission of end point devices the femto cell
     has not yet admitted, or the network policies can require
     re-authorization every time a end point device attempts access. Once an
     end point device is connected to the femto cell intermediate networking
     device, the verifiable traffic monitoring, control and billing functions
     described herein can be applied to various application embodiments. For
     example, the intermediate networking device service policy verification
     techniques disclosed herein, as similarly described with respect to
     various device embodiments, can similarly be applied to the femto cell
     intermediate networking device embodiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [0532] In some embodiments, the service provider desires to keep the
     number of end point devices or users that access an intermediate
     networking device below a certain count specified in the service
     processor 115 profile. In some embodiments, this is accomplished by
     controlling the number of IP addresses allowed onto the intermediate
     networking device local area side connection. In some embodiments, this
     is facilitated by observing the end point device identification
     parameters available in the end point device traffic. In some
     embodiments, this is facilitated by observing the traffic patterns to
     determine the likely number of devices connecting to the network. For
     example, traffic demand patterns can be examined to determine how many
