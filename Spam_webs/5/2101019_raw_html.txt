    <br/>
    Statement on "Race"
   </font>
   <br/>
   (May 17, 1998)
  </center>
  <p>
   The following statement was adopted by the Executive Board of the 
          American Anthropological Association, acting on a draft prepared by 
          a committee of representative American anthropologists. It does not 
          reflect a consensus of all members of the AAA, as individuals vary in 
          their approaches to the study of "race." We believe that it represents 
          generally the contemporary thinking and scholarly positions of a majority 
          of anthropologists.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   In the United States both scholars and the general public have been 
          conditioned to viewing human races as natural and separate divisions 
          within the human species based on visible physical differences. With 
          the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, 
          it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly 
          demarcated, biologically distinct groups. Evidence from the analysis 
          of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 
          94%, lies
   <i>
    within
   </i>
   so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic 
          "racial" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their 
          genes. This means that there is greater variation within "racial" groups 
          than between them. In neighboring populations there is much overlapping 
          of genes and their phenotypic (physical) expressions. Throughout history 
          whenever different groups have come into contact, they have interbred. 
          The continued sharing of genetic materials has maintained all of humankind 
          as a single species.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physical variations in any given trait tend to occur gradually rather 
          than abruptly over geographic areas. And because physical traits are 
          inherited independently of one another, knowing the range of one trait 
          does not predict the presence of others. For example, skin color varies 
          largely from light in the temperate areas in the north to dark in the 
          tropical areas in the south; its intensity is not related to nose shape 
          or hair texture. Dark skin may be associated with frizzy or kinky hair 
          or curly or wavy or straight hair, all of which are found among different 
          indigenous peoples in tropical regions. These facts render any attempt 
          to establish lines of division among biological populations both arbitrary 
          and subjective.
  </p>
  <p>
   Historical research has shown that the idea of "race" has always carried 
          more meanings than mere physical differences; indeed, physical variations 
          in the human species have no meaning except the social ones that humans 
          put on them. Today scholars in many fields argue that "race" as it is 
          understood in the United States of America was a social mechanism invented 
          during the 18th century to refer to those populations brought together 
          in colonial America: the English and other European settlers, the conquered 
          Indian peoples, and those peoples of Africa brought in to provide slave 
          labor.
  </p>
  <p>
   From its inception, this modern concept of "race" was modeled after 
          an ancient theorem of the Great Chain of Being, which posited natural 
          categories on a hierarchy established by God or nature. Thus "race" 
          was a mode of classification linked specifically to peoples in the colonial 
          situation. It subsumed a growing ideology of inequality devised to rationalize 
          European attitudes and treatment of the conquered and enslaved peoples. 
          Proponents of slavery in particular during the 19th century used "race" 
          to justify the retention of slavery. The ideology magnified the differences 
          among Europeans, Africans, and Indians, established a rigid hierarchy 
          of socially exclusive categories underscored and bolstered unequal rank 
          and status differences, and provided the rationalization that the inequality 
          was natural or God-given. The different physical traits of African-Americans 
          and Indians became markers or symbols of their status differences.
  </p>
  <p>
   As they were constructing US society, leaders among European-Americans 
          fabricated the cultural/behavioral characteristics associated with each 
          "race," linking superior traits with Europeans and negative and inferior 
          ones to blacks and Indians. Numerous arbitrary and fictitious beliefs 
          about the different peoples were institutionalized and deeply embedded 
          in American thought.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in the 19th century the growing fields of science began to reflect 
          the public consciousness about human differences. Differences among 
          the "racial" categories were projected to their greatest extreme when 
          the argument was posed that Africans, Indians, and Europeans were separate 
          species, with Africans the least human and closer taxonomically to apes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately "race" as an ideology about human differences was subsequently 
          spread to other areas of the world. It became a strategy for dividing, 
          ranking, and controlling colonized people used by colonial powers everywhere. 
          But it was not limited to the colonial situation. In the latter part 
          of the 19th century it was employed by Europeans to rank one another 
          and to justify social, economic, and political inequalities among their 
          peoples. During World War II, the Nazis under Adolf Hitler enjoined 
          the expanded ideology of "race" and "racial" differences and took them 
          to a logical end: the extermination of 11 million people of "inferior 
          races" (e.g., Jews, Gypsies, Africans, homosexuals, and so forth) and 
          other unspeakable brutalities of the Holocaust.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Race" thus evolved as a worldview, a body of prejudgments that distorts 
          our ideas about human differences and group behavior. Racial beliefs 
          constitute myths about the diversity in the human species and about 
          the abilities and behavior of people homogenized into "racial" categories. 
          The myths fused behavior and physical features together in the public 
          mind, impeding our comprehension of both biological variations and cultural 
          behavior, implying that both are genetically determined. Racial myths 
          bear no relationship to the reality of human capabilities or behavior. 
          Scientists today find that reliance on such folk beliefs about human 
          differences in research has led to countless errors.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of the 20th century, we now understand that human cultural 
          behavior is learned, conditioned into infants beginning at birth, and 
          always subject to modification. No human is born with a built-in culture 
          or language. Our temperaments, dispositions, and personalities, regardless 
          of genetic propensities, are developed within sets of meanings and values 
          that we call "culture." Studies of infant and early childhood learning 
          and behavior attest to the reality of our cultures in forming who we 
          are.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a basic tenet of anthropological knowledge that all normal human 
          beings have the capacity to learn any cultural behavior. The American 
          experience with immigrants from hundreds of different language and cultural 
          backgrounds who have acquired some version of American culture traits 
          and behavior is the clearest evidence of this fact. Moreover, people 
          of all physical variations have learned different cultural behaviors 
          and continue to do so as modern transportation moves millions of immigrants 
          around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   How people have been accepted and treated within the context of a 
          given society or culture has a direct impact on how they perform in 
          that society. The "racial" worldview was invented to assign some groups 
          to perpetual low status, while others were permitted access to privilege, 
          power, and wealth. The tragedy in the United States has been that the 
          policies and practices stemming from this worldview succeeded all too 
          well in constructing unequal populations among Europeans, Native Americans, 
          and peoples of African descent. Given what we know about the capacity 
          of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture, we conclude 
          that present-day inequalities between so-called "racial" groups are 
          not consequences of their biological inheritance but products of historical 
          and contemporary social, economic, educational, and political circumstances.

    AAA Position Paper on "Race": Comments?
   </font>

  As a result of public confusion about the meaning of "race," claims 
          as to major biological differences among "races" continue to be advanced. 
          Stemming from past AAA actions designed to address public misconceptions 
          on race and intelligence, the need was apparent for a clear AAA statement 
          on the biology and politics of race that would be educational and informational. 
          Rather than wait for each spurious claim to be raised, the AAA Executive 
          Board determined that the Association should prepare a statement for 
          approval by the Association and elicit member input.
  <p>
   Commissioned by the Executive Board of the American Anthropological 
          Association, a position paper on race was authored by Audrey Smedley 
          (
   <i>
    Race in North America: Origin and Evolution of a Worldview,
   </i>
   1993) and thrice reviewed by a working group of prominent anthropologists: 
          George Armelagos, Michael Blakey, C. Loring Brace, Alan Goodman, Faye 
          Harrison, Jonathan Marks, Yolanda Moses, and Carol Mukhopadhyay. A draft 
          of the current paper was published in the September 1997
   <i>
    Anthropology 
          Newsletter
   </i>
   and posted ont the AAA website
   <a href="../index.htm">
    http://www.aaanet.org
   </a>
   for a number of months, and member comments were requested. While Smedley 
          assumed authorship of the final draft, she received comments not only 
          from the working group but also from the AAA membership and other interested 
          readers. The paper above was adopted by the AAA Executive Board on May 
          17, 1998, as an official statement of AAA's position on "race."
  </p>
  <p>
   As the paper is considered a
   <i>
    living statement,
   </i>
   AAA members', 
          other anthropologists', and public comments are invited. Your comments 
          may be sent via mail or e-mail to
