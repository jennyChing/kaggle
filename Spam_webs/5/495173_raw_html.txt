     <li>
      How to start a new business from scratch.

       Offering value is not enough. If no one knows (or cares) about what you have to offer, it doesnt matter how much value you create. Without marketing, no business can survive  people who don't know you exist can't purchase what you have to offer, and people who arent interested in what you have to offer won't become paying customers.

       Every successful business ultimately sells what it has to offer. Having millions of prospects isn't enough if no one ultimately pulls out their wallet and says, "I'll take one." The sales process begins with a prospect and ends with a paying customer. No sale, no business.

       <em>
        How to be an All-Around Optimized and Awesome Human Being
       </em>
       ... I think anyone and everyone living in our modern world would be well-served by reading this book... I got the Audible edition, bought the Kindle edition to read along with, and just ordered the print copy so I can make lots of notes and refer to it often. If buying the same book three times isn't compelling evidence of this book's value, then I don' t know what is! Read it. Now."
