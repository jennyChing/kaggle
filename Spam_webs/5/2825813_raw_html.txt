As well as the provocative artist&rsquo;s spot and spin paintings and his signature medicine cabinets, the show boasts the biggest pickled shark he has ever made, weighing in at a gargantuan 76 tons, and his diamond-encrusted skull, a piece that he once boasted was the most expensive artwork ever made by a living artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is being staged in Qatar&rsquo;s capital Doha, in the Al Riwaq exhibition space, a building which has been covered with coloured dots for the occasion. But that is not all: outside an as-yet-unfinished medical centre, Hirst has placed The Miraculous Journey, a series of 14 massive bronze sculptures charting a foetus from conception to birth. The project cost a reported $20m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sculptures are seen as highly controversial in Qatar, where shop mannequins still sometimes don&rsquo;t have heads, because of the Muslim unease with anything figurative. But they were ordered by the sister of the emir, Sheikha Al-Mayassa Al Thani, who is determinedly driving forward a culture programme which challenges traditional notions in the conservative Islamic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as bringing a whole series of keynote exhibitions such as the Hirst to Qatar, the country has also underwritten exhibitions abroad. In 2010 it funded an exhibition by the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami in Versailles, which infuriated French purists, who felt that the artist&rsquo;s colourful pop-meets-manga style was totally at odds with the graceful interiors of the hallowed palace. And last year Qatar stepped up to the plate for Hirst, underwriting his exhibition at Tate Modern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each show was followed up by an even splashier rendering in Doha: Murakami last year, and Hirst now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheikha Al-Mayassa is not just sponsoring exhibitions. She is best known for being the biggest art buyer in the world, paying colossal sums to snap up the top artworks available on the market: some estimates suggest she is spending up to $1bn a year on art, although this figure may be exaggerated. Qatar never comments on its acquisitions, and all those who work with the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA), which is headed by the sheikha, sign stringent confidentiality contracts. But news inevitably filters out and it is reliably believed that she paid the highest price ever given for a work of art in 2011, acquiring C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s 1895 version of The Card Players directly from its Greek owner for $250m. It was the last of the five paintings on the theme not already in a museum and is considered one of the most important works of art by the artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as the C&eacute;zanne, Qatar &ndash; the royal family or the QMA, it&rsquo;s not quite clear &ndash; has snapped up works by Rothko, Hirst, Warhol and many other modern masters, paying huge prices at auction or through dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspicuous consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent rumours in the past have maintained that Qatar&rsquo;s sovereign fund was also interested in buying the auction house Christie&rsquo;s. This would make sense, since actually owning the shop would give the country even better access to works of art for sale. And Qatar likes trophy assets: among its purchases are Harrods and the French football club Paris St-Germain, and it possesses substantial holdings in Volkswagen, Porsche and Tiffany. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the Christie&rsquo;s deal does not seem to have come off, the QMA has acquired some of its ex-employees: Edward Dolman, former CEO, is now in charge of Sheikha Al-Mayasssa&rsquo;s office, while art specialist Jean-Paul Engelen is now director of the public art programme. He has been responsible for placing, among other works, a 17ft (5m) high statue by the artist Adel Abdessemed of the footballer Zinedine Zidane headbutting Marco Materazzi. This is now installed on Doha&rsquo;s waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What remains something of a mystery is where all of the art Qatar is acquiring will go. It is hard to know for sure what is intended for the royal family&rsquo;s personal collection and what will go into a museum one day. Qatar already has one sensational showcase, the Museum of Islamic Art, designed by the famed Chinese-American architect IM Pei, who built the Louvre pyramid. Work continues day and night on the National Museum of Qatar, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, which is due to open at the end of next year. Mathaf, the Arab Museum of Modern Art, is up and running, as is the art space Al Riwaq, where the Hirst exhibition is being held. Other institutions are planned, and Dolman has often said, without offering more details, that Qatar will be producing some &ldquo;sensational surprises&rdquo; to coincide with the World Cup in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparations for the World Cup, meanwhile, have projected Qatar into the news for another reason, and not one connected with art. Human Rights Watch has slammed the conditions of workers preparing the infrastructure for the country&rsquo;s hosting of the 2022 World Cup, with Nepalese builders reported to be dying at the rate of one a day this summer. Such problems are not unusual in the region, where workers toil in conditions of near-slavery: nearby Abu Dhabi, which has its own ambitious museum building programme, has also been criticised for the same practices. In this case, the artists themselves called for a boycott of the projected Guggenheim museum until conditions were improved. In Qatar, however, there seems to have been no such disquiet so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":213867,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SourceHeight":549,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/17/r1/p017r15q.jpg","SourceWidth":976,"SynopsisLong":"The Art Market column graphic (Copyright: Thinkstock)","SynopsisMedium":"The Art Market column graphic (Copyright: Thinkstock)","SynopsisShort":"The Art Market column graphic (Copyright: Thinkstock)","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/17/r1/p017r15q.jpg","Title":"The Art Market2.jpg","CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p017r15q","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p017r15q","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p017r15q","_id":"559a67b7bed0a737e5de3f8e"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Georgina Adam reports on the business of art from established capitals and emerging cultural centres.","Name":"The Art Market","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"The Art Market","CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/column/the-art-market","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0a9a"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":270836,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SourceHeight":1080,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/2v/dk/p02vdkxc.jpg","SourceWidth":1920,"SynopsisLong":"(Credit: Getty Images)","SynopsisMedium":"(Credit: Getty Images)","SynopsisShort":"(Credit: Getty Images)","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/2v/dk/p02vdkxc.jpg","Title":"sections_art_gettyimages_1920x1080.jpg"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p02vdkxc","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p02vdkxc","_id":"559a69aebed0a737e5de89be"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Art","Name":"Art","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Art"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:00:08.420623Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"290b9e17-8e10-40e1-95d4-131e16ddbe00","Id":"wwculture/section/art","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:17:46.114188Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/art"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/art","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0aac"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Qatar: Contemporary arts biggest buyer","HeadlineShort":"Qatar: The art worlds big fish","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The tiny Gulf state of Qatar is the worlds largest buyer of contemporary art and is hosting the biggest ever showcase of Damien Hirsts work.

Up for sale was a fine jadeite figure of a roly-poly Buddha, just four inches high, which had started out at 450,000 yuan ($73,500). As Jin masterfully fielded bids in English and Mandarin from around the packed saleroom, applause and whoops erupted each time a paddle was waved. In the end, she cracked the hammer at 5.5 million yuan, meaning the tiny jewel made over $1m, ten times its estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting was the ballroom of the extravagant new Shangri-la hotel in Shanghai, and the occasion was historic for Christie&rsquo;s. Jin was conducting the firm&rsquo;s first-ever auction in mainland China, which until recently debarred foreigners from doing any such thing in its territory. The country is a potential gold mine for the art market: auction sales of art and antiques in the mainland were worth an eye-popping $4.6 billion last year, according to its Ministry of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotheby&rsquo;s and Christie&rsquo;s have now obtained the precious authorisation to do business in China. Sotheby&rsquo;s went first last year, doing a deal with the state-owned GeHua, which allows it to sell in the Beijing Freeport &ndash; a tax free zone for arts and entertainment companies &ndash; and other designated sites. It has already held two sales: one purely symbolic, the other a charity auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Christie&rsquo;s powered in from behind and six months ago obtained a licence to practice, this time anywhere in the mainland. It chose to set up in Shanghai, citing encouragement from the city, which is keen to stimulate more trade &nbsp;and whose population of 23m makes it the largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same week as Christie&rsquo;s auction, the government announced the opening of a 29 sq km free trade zone in the Pudong district. This will enable Christie&rsquo;s to bring in works of art for sale without paying import duty. And mainland buyers, if they leave them in the free trade zone, will not have to pay the swingeing import tax on art of 30% or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restricted items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, another major handicap remains. Neither Christie&rsquo;s nor Sotheby&rsquo;s can sell &lsquo;cultural relics&rsquo;: jades, scroll paintings and ceramics dating from before 1911 or 1949, depending on the category. Asked about this, the juiciest part of the market, Christie&rsquo;s&rsquo; CEO Steven Murphy said diplomatically: &ldquo;\"We're happy to operate here without the freedom to sell [them], and when that changes we'll change with it; we&rsquo;re patient.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, foreign auction houses &ndash; including Sotheby&rsquo;s and Christie&rsquo;s &ndash; have operated without this constraint in tax-free Hong Kong, holding two series of sales each year, in spring and autumn. According to Murphy, 30% of the buyers in Hong Kong come from the mainland: last year, Christie&rsquo;s Hong Kong sales totalled $716m, 14% of its global auction sales. (Sotheby&rsquo;s revenues in the territory were a tad higher, at 15%). Murphy claimed that the new mainland sales will expand the market, and not cannibalise Hong Kong, by making it easier for collectors to buy locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;China in the 21st Century will be what the US was in the 20th and Europe in the 19th,&rdquo; Christie&rsquo;s owner Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault told me just before the auction: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terribly important for our future to be here.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinault, along with an impressive line-up of Christie&rsquo;s staff and top clients, had jetted in for a three-day round of cultural visits, forums and parties in advance of the auction &ndash; and hosted a sumptuous dinner catered by the renowned French chef Pierre Gagnaire, featuring a Chinese opera performance. For the preview and auction, the firm had constructed a series of rooms within the immense ballroom of the Shangri-la. As well as showing off the jewellery, art, wine and watches due to be sold, it boasted a &lsquo;salon priv&eacute;&rsquo; where works for private sale were displayed, along with tasters from its online and upcoming New York sales. &ldquo;The point is to show the range of what we do,&rdquo; said Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christie&rsquo;s denies there is any connection, but shortly before obtaining the licence to operate in China, Pinault and his son Fran&ccedil;ois-Henri had officially presented the Chinese government with a prize they have long coveted: two 18th Century Zodiac heads, looted from Beijing&rsquo;s Summer Palace in the 19th Century. Controversially, the bronzes were sold at a 2009 auction of the French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent&rsquo;s art collection, but remained unpaid when their Chinese buyer refused to settle up, citing patriotic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspicuous consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for&nbsp; luxury goods in China is enormous, with consumers eagerly snapping up brand names like Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen &ndash; all part of Pinault&rsquo;s sprawling Kering group. Christie&rsquo;s orchestrated the auction as a major branding exercise, with scarlet banners in the streets and its name splashed across a huge building overlooking the river. Mindful of the Chinese respect for longevity, on every occasion they hammered home the age of the company, which was founded in 1766.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inaugural sale, with its mix of wine, watches, art and jewellery, was modest in size and, certainly for the art, of indifferent quality. So the total of almost $24m, at the top end of its pre-sale target of $16m-$25.3m, was encouraging, as was the enthusiastic response of the 950 people who crowded into the ballroom and an overflow room outside. Only one lot didn&rsquo;t sell, a painting by the Italian artist Giorgio Morandi, but a frankly awful Picasso, Homme Assis, 1969, made a miraculous $1.8m after a lively bidding battle. It was the first Picasso to be sold at auction in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Tonight was the first step in our development and we will continue individual sales from next year and beyond,&rdquo; promised the firm&rsquo;s Asia chairman, the Frenchman Fran&ccedil;ois Curiel after the sale: &ldquo;Our dream was that Chinese buyers would be excited, and they were,&rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Georgina Adam reports on the business of art from established capitals and emerging cultural centres.","Name":"The Art Market","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"The Art Market","CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/column/the-art-market","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0a9a"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Art","Name":"Art","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Art"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:00:08.420623Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"290b9e17-8e10-40e1-95d4-131e16ddbe00","Id":"wwculture/section/art","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:17:46.114188Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/art"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/art","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0aac"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Art auction houses vie for a foothold in China","HeadlineShort":"Arts big brands battle in China","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The countrys art market is opening up  and its an eye-watering prospect for the big international auction houses.

And its position at the heart of the region, close to Russia, the Middle East as well as Europe, makes it a hub.&rdquo; He felt it was time Istanbul had a truly international fair, bringing foreign buyers into Turkey and facilitating the opening up of the country to foreign galleries, to promote &ndash; and sell &ndash; their international artists. And he timed it to coincide with the well-respected Istanbul Biennial. &ldquo;Everyone was enthusiastic,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey is one of the newest emerging markets for art. It has a small group of extremely wealthy collectors, who are buying international as well as domestic contemporary art and creating museums. The Ko&ccedil; family, for example, has its own foundation and plans to open a museum in 2016: it will show 800 works of art. The Eczacibasi family already has its own museum, Istanbul Modern, as does the Sabanci family, currently devoting its art centre to a show by Anish Kapoor. At auction, the first half of this year already saw $25.5m (&pound;16m) spent on Turkish and Middle Eastern artists, according to the art data site Artprice.com &ndash; already close to the total of $35.5m (&pound;22.1m) spent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripples of protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However this rosy scenario darkened dramatically this summer, when a series of protests rippled through the country after a brutal police crackdown on demonstrations in Taksim Square. &ldquo;Many of my exhibitors wanted to pull out then and there,&rdquo; says Angus. While the wave of protests died down, they have not gone away &ndash; a 35-year-old sound technician died this month from, his family say, the effects of tear-gas, with his death triggering silent sit-ins in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a threatened bombing in Syria, the US State Department issued a warning to its citizens not to travel to Turkey &ndash; just before the fair opened, while the Turkish lira had already plunged in value. &ldquo;Just everything seemed to be going wrong,&rdquo; said the US dealer Wendy Norris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to prise open a new market was tough in other ways, as Angus learnt to his cost. The Biennial organisers demanded that the fair should start on a Sunday, four days after their opening, because they wanted to distance it from their own non-commercial event. The effect was to discourage some international visitors from staying on. Fierce competition came from Istanbul&rsquo;s existing art fair, Contemporary Istanbul (CI), held in November: it grabbed most of the available public advertising space for its own fair, despite it being two months away &ndash; to catch the international visitors to the Biennial, the organisers said. They also took the new fair to court at the last minute, claiming it had breached their copyright by using the name ArtInternational Istanbul, and obtained that the &lsquo;Istanbul&rsquo; should be dropped from the title. This meant all the material, from tickets to the catalogues, had to be reprinted at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it must have been bad luck that the whole fair entrance had to be taken down and then rebuilt the day before the opening, because of a visit to the site by the Turkish prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right on the night?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, the fair went ahead with 62 dealers, including some major names such as Pace, Lisson and Yvon Lambert, and the first day attracted pretty well all the major collectors in the country. The fair director, Dyala Nusseibeh, has close links with the United Arab Emirates, where her father is a trusted advisor to the president, and a number of collectors from the Gulf were also in attendance, including Sheikha Hoor of Sharjah and Prince Fahad Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. &ldquo;There are bilateral trade agreements with Gulf states and a lot of Gulf investment here, so it&rsquo;s a natural draw,&rdquo; said Nusseibeh. While there were fewer Europeans, Caroline Bourgeois, curator for the luxury-goods mogul and collector Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault &ndash; who also owns Christie&rsquo;s &ndash; was trawling the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite all the fears that the economic slowdown and political unrest would kibosh business, sales were made, albeit at a low level. &ldquo;Istanbul is a great place to visit, and the city could be the hub for the whole region,&rdquo; said Norris: &ldquo;Anyway, I like risk taking.&rdquo; By the second day she had sold enough to cover her costs, so was happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ten Turkish galleries, inevitably, did well, with Moiz Zilberman celebrating making a slew of sales at the opening. And Tankut Aykut of the local Dirimart Gallery was optimistic: &ldquo;We had a horrible couple of months, but things are pretty well back to normal now. I don&rsquo;t think the troubles had a huge economic impact on the art trade here,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Anyway, Turkey is always a bit chaotic and hectic &ndash; that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angus is going ahead with next year&rsquo;s event: &ldquo;The instinct to set up an international fair of this calibre was emphatically justified,&rdquo; he said. Next year, though, he will change the opening dates and &ldquo;Put in much more concentrated effort on the north and east to achieve our ambitions of a comprehensive global art fair.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Against all odds: Turkeys newest art fair","HeadlineShort":"Against all odds: Art in Turkey","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Political unrest and bitter commercial rivalries almost derailed Turkeys newest art fair.

Since it was first recorded at the turn of the 17th century in Rome, where it was supposedly discovered in a sarcophagus in the tomb of the emperor Alexander Severus, this exquisitely worked example of imperial Roman cameo glass has resisted the ingenious efforts of generations of art historians to understand the mysterious scenes carved upon its sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, scholars have suggested up to 50 different interpretations explaining the imagery on the vase. Of the seven figures carved out of opaque white glass overlaying a deep and translucent cobalt-blue background, the identity of only one character is certain &ndash; that of Cupid. Holding a bow and a torch, and fluttering in mid-air, he turns back as though to entice a heroic young man towards a seated, semi-naked woman embracing a slithery monster, possibly a sea serpent, rearing up between her legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identity of the rest of the group is up for grabs. Does each side represent a different mythological wedding &ndash; of Peleus and Thetis, and Achilles and Helen? Perhaps the figures represent historical personages such as Mark Antony and Cleopatra? Or maybe both scenes celebrate the first emperor of Rome Augustus, who is sometimes suggested as the vase&rsquo;s original owner? The truth is that scholars will probably never agree on the meaning of the Portland Vase, which is now enshrined as a conundrum of the classical world more fiendish than the riddle of the Sphinx. Solving its perplexity would diminish its mystique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A cameo role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Portland Vase is the most famous example of ancient cameo glass, a type of luxurious vessel inspired by intricate relief-cut gems that thrived in the early Roman Empire up to around AD 50 or 60. Very few examples of imperial Roman cameo glass survive &ndash; in 1990 the scholar David Whitehouse counted 15 major extant vessels and objects, including the British Museum&rsquo;s Auldjo Jug and the Blue Vase from Pompeii that is now in the Naples Archaeological Museum. This may be partly ascribed to the time-consuming difficulty of producing cameo glass: it took John Northwood three years to produce the first glass replica of the Portland Vase in 1876. Unearthing a vessel as fine as the Portland Vase, then, is exceptionally rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when Bonhams auction house in London released photographs of a privately owned Roman cameo glass vessel four years ago, it was a big deal. The Portland Vase, which is 24.5cm (10in) high and weighs 1.3kg (3lb), is decorated with seven figures. The new vase, which stands 35.5cm (14in) tall and weighs 2.85kg (6lb), and is also made in dark blue glass with an opaque white overlay, boasts 38. These are divided between two dense friezes including a scene that depicts the punishment of the mythological character Dirce, who was killed by being tied to the horns of a bull. The lower frieze, which presents a battle scene containing 18 figures including five on horseback and five corpses, provides a clue to the original shape of the Portland Vase, which most likely was not flat-bottomed in antiquity, but tapered like an amphora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It is the single most important piece of glass to appear since the Portland Vase,&rdquo; explains the glassmaker David Hill, one of seven people invited to the British Museum to inspect the object alongside the Portland Vase and the Auldjo Jug. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if the matching pair to Michelangelo&rsquo;s David suddenly turned up out of nowhere &ndash; only this time, it&rsquo;s Goliath. It dwarfs the Portland Vase.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It is immensely important,&rdquo; agrees Martine Newby, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London who, at the invitation of Bonhams, was the first person to inspect the vase in 2009, reporting her findings in the Glass News journal the following year. &ldquo;It is indescribable, really &ndash; a tour de force. It would be a masterpiece of ancient art of whatever material. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it was silver or gold or some of the best frescoes, this would have been one of the most expensive objects that you could possibly have.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would the vase have been used for? &ldquo;It was presumably a cinerary urn containing the cremated remains of an incredibly important, high-ranking individual,&rdquo; Newby explains. &ldquo;It was either a personal imperial gift, or for somebody who could afford one of the most luxurious pieces in existence.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where is this masterpiece of ancient art today &ndash; and why is it not on display in one of the world&rsquo;s great museums? According to Bonhams, who say that it was never for sale, the vase, which is broken, was consigned for study, restoration and &ldquo;public exposure&rdquo; before being returned to its owner. Its provenance is unknown, but, according to experts, the consignor was the daughter of a dead European collector, who was given the vase by an Italian friend soon after the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration drama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, several experts I have spoken to suggest that the story behind the vase is murkier and more complicated. After the vase had been studied at the British Museum, there were plans to send it to Cardiff University for scientific analysis. Before it could get there, though, rumours began to emerge that it had been discovered recently in North Africa, and that it was broken when it was found. It even appeared that the vase had been damaged permanently within the past decade &ndash; a botched attempt at restoration, perhaps, or, more sinisterly, a sneaky way of passing off a recent restoration as something older, so that the vase would appear authentic. With its provenance in question (for instance, nobody could prove the existence of the shadowy Italian, supposedly a well-to-do family friend who had given it to the consignor&rsquo;s father), the vase, which could be worth millions of pounds at auction, was quietly returned to its owner. &ldquo;It was really disappointing,&rdquo; recalls Newby, &ldquo;because there I was working on it, and then it was taken away from me, and that was it &ndash; the doors were closed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vase now languishes in unsellable limbo. Its whereabouts are unknown, although amongst experts there is a whisper that it is hidden away in a bank vault in Brussels, denied the recognition of its celebrated cousin, the Portland Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the antiquities market is plagued with fakes, and not everybody believes that the vase is ancient. Paul Roberts of the British Museum, who studied the vessel alongside the Portland Vase and the Auldjo Jug, declined to comment. But Newby and Hill are both adamant that it is the real deal. &ldquo;No faker could have included details that are only known to the tiny handful of glass anoraks like us who have seen these things in pieces and understand how they were made,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;Even the very best fakers in glass are woefully poor craftsmen, and any attempts at faking Roman cameo glass are doomed from the start. The bottom line is that the glass itself needs to be tested. When both the blue and the white are proven conclusively to be Roman, there really cannot be any farther argument. The vase is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery, and we just want to see it treated with the respect it deserves, for few of us are likely ever to see anything as important as this appear again.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alastair Sooke is art critic for The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The mystery of the ancient glass masterpiece","HeadlineShort":"Mystery of a missing masterpiece","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"When a rare Roman glass vase emerged in 2009, it was big news in the art world  until the vessel vanished.

So expensive, in fact, that no-one even knows how much it could make. The multi-billion dollar collection of the Detroit Institute of Art (DIA), packed with masterpieces by Rembrandt, Picasso, Degas, van Gogh, and many other painters, as well as sculpture, furniture and ancient Greek pottery, is under real threat of ending up under the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a chorus of disapproval, Christie&rsquo;s has been called in to put a price on part of DIA&rsquo;s holdings, which comprise thousands of items. Just 40 of them, the greatest treasures, could be worth an eye-popping $2.5 billion, according to the Detroit Free Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because the city of Detroit is on the brink of bankruptcy, with an estimated $18 billion in debts. So it is looking at all its assets &ndash; which include the art &ndash; to see what it can sell off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit is an extreme, and tragic case: the art is literally irreplaceable. While its case is unique &ndash; the sale is by no means a done deal, and would be to pay the city&rsquo;s debts, not the DIA&rsquo;s own &ndash; it comes amid a mounting tide of museum disposals around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With museums staring at falling incomes and rising costs, the temptation to raid the basements is getting stronger. Also driving the trend is the current fashion for hip contemporary art: this month the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts announced it was off-loading one of its two paintings by Edward Hopper, to kick-start an acquisition fund for &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; contemporary art. So Hopper&rsquo;s East Wind over Weehawken, is going on the block at Christie&rsquo;s in December, with an estimate of $22m-$28m. Poignantly, the bleak street scene from 1934 features a sign scrawled in scarlet letters in the foreground &ndash; &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sale of the century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such disposals have been happening for years. To howls of disapproval, in 2007 the Albright-Knox museum in Buffalo, New York, sold some of its prize historic treasures to concentrate on what director Louis Grachos called its core mission, buying and showing the &ldquo;art of the present&rdquo;. A Roman period bronze sculpture of Artemis and the Stag was hammered down by Sotheby&rsquo;s New York for a lusty $28.6m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis, such sales have accelerated sharply. In 2011 alone, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Getty Center in LA, the Art Institute of Chicago and the New Jersey Historical Society all sold works at auction. In February this year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art dumped 16 Old Masters at Sotheby&rsquo;s, raising $2.4m, including $626,500 for a portrait by a follower of Rubens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, museum disposals are far rarer, in some countries, such as France, they are forbidden by law for works in national collections. In general, museum associations require that if works are sold, then the money raised must go towards other acquisitions rather than just fixing the plumbing. The global authority, the International Council of Museums is clear: &ldquo;Museum collections are held in public trust and may not be treated as a realisable asset,&rdquo; it states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arguments against such sales are many and convincing, with the notion of &ldquo;public trust&rdquo; being crucial: museums must be seen and trusted as institutions that are not blown here and there by the winds of fashion or by commercial considerations. The Hermitage Museum in Russia disposed of swathes of masterpieces in the 1930s, to ease its dire balance of payments problems; in the 1950s, Minneapolis became infamous for selling thousands of paintings, antiquities and Asian works of art. New York&rsquo;s Metropolitan Museum of Art caused an international scandal in the 1970s when it booted out Van Gogh, Modigliani, Picasso, Renoir and other works to buy David Smith and a Richard Diebenkorn. None of those institutions could afford to buy back those works now, even if they were available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another argument against selling off art is that it might deter future donors from gifting works, if they might one day end up in the saleroom. A few years ago a New York museum put up for sale a David Smith sculpture without even bothering to consult the donor &ndash; who was alive, well and furious when he heard it was going under the hammer. (The museum hastily backtracked and withdrew the work from auction.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upstairs, downstairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a counter argument to all this. Museums are not stuffed with masterpieces &ndash; far from it. Most have a few highlights and vast troves of works that are in poor condition, duplicates and never on show. Even the exacting American Association of Art Museum Directors accepts sales when there is an effort to &ldquo;refine and improve&rdquo; a collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when works sold by museums are substandard, they command premium prices, thanks to the prestigious label of the institution &ndash; even if no longer wanted. The auction houses are frantic to sell any cast-offs, knowing that buyers will be prepared to push up prices more than for a work without such a provenance. In the case of Detroit, with its tip-top collection, any sale would be sure to shatter the record books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many fear that the current round of disposals might prove short-sighted. There is increasing pressure on museums to show flashy new art, to bring in a new, younger and more diverse public. But contemporary art prices are at an all-time high, forcing institutions to dig deeper into their pockets to acquire what may&nbsp; prove to be today&rsquo;s firework, but tomorrow&rsquo;s damp squib &ndash; and an expensive one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Detroits art sell-off: Flogging the family silver?","HeadlineShort":"Detroit: Art treasures for sale?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Georgina Adam looks at the temptation for museums to raid their treasure chests to pay the bills  or buy new trophy art.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Georgina Adam looks at the temptation for museums to raid their treasure chests to pay the bills  or buy new trophy art.","SummaryShort":"When museums flog the family silver","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"212f0fdd-d701-4860-b9fd-1658a2aa6181","Id":"wwculture/story/20130909-detroit-art-treasures-for-sale","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20130909-detroit-art-treasures-for-sale"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20130909-detroit-art-treasures-for-sale","_id":"559a69c0bed0a737e5de8ca7"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":[],"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"gallery","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;Ker-CHING! Probably the most direct &ndash; or crass &ndash; display at last week&rsquo;s Art Basel Hong Kong fair was an array of Andy Warhol dollar signs, conveniently sited right by the entrance to the VIP lounge. Brought by first-time exhibitor Dominique Levy of New York, the silk-screened works were on offer at up to a steep $6.5m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levy was at the fair, along with 244 other exhibitors, because China represents a potential Eldorado for art dealers. In 2011 the world discovered with amazement that China had become the largest art market, beating the traditional heavyweights, the US and the UK, with sales of over $10 billion. And it had rocketed to this position with extraordinary velocity: in 1990 its share of the global art pie was an infinitesimal 0.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western gallerists rushed to set up galleries in Asia, or at least hire Chinese-speaking personnel. Hong Kong, with its business-friendly, tax- and censorship-free status, became the number one choice for attacking the Chinese market, and the gateway to the whole region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That initial elation was short lived, however. Last year art sales in China and Hong Kong slumped by 40% overall, both on the mainland and in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great fall of China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this dramatic downturn were threefold. Firstly, the frenetic growth of the art market &ndash; 20% per annum between 2009 and 2011 &ndash; was just not sustainable. And the Chinese economy was slowing. The rise in GDP fell from 9.2% in 2011 to 7.2% in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most seriously for art sales, there was a crackdown on tax evasion by art buyers on the mainland. Last year two art shippers and a museum director were slammed into prison, and heavy fines were imposed on those found to have under-declared values. This, inevitably, sent a chill through the market. Since then Chinese art galleries have been struggling to make ends meet and a number have closed, reports Cheng Xindong, the Beijing-based director of the Art Gallery Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet at the same time mainland China is in the grip of a frenzied museum-building boom. In the last few years, about 100 museums have opened annually with a peak of nearly 400 in 2011, according to the Chinese Society of Museums. These museums are not only in the major urban centres, such as Shanghai &ndash; with its new, $64m &lt;a href=\"http://www.powerstationofart.org/en/\"&gt;Power Station&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; or Beijing, where the &lt;a href=\"http://en.chnmuseum.cn/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\"&gt;National Museum of China&lt;/a&gt; recently emerged from a $400m revamp. Even in far-off Yinchuan, at the point where the Great Wall of China meets the Yellow River, almost $300m is being lavished on an arts centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private collectors are also opening museums, such as the Shanghai billionaire investor Liu Yiqian and his wife Wang Wei, who have already opened one, and are about to launch a second. Liu has dropped huge sums to buy art: he paid $27m to buy a 16th-century Ming scroll at auction in Beijing in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So China is still seen as a potential goldmine, even if the bulk of sales are in the traditional fields such as ceramics and scroll paintings. This is why dealers jetted in to exhibit at the Hong Kong fair. And with Christie&rsquo;s spring array of auction sales being held at the same time, deep-pocketed collectors from all around the region &ndash; from the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Korea &ndash; were also in town for what has become Hong Kong&rsquo;s &lsquo;art week&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there were the socialites: the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich&nbsp; with his art-loving partner Dasha Zhukova; Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang; Wendi Deng Murdoch, wife of publishing mogul Rupert Murdoch; model Kate Moss and Hong Kong pop star Edison Chen. The Chinese dealer and all-out glamour girl, Pearl Lam, who never does things by halves, was showing colourful paintings by Zhu Jinshi in her Pedder Building gallery and threw a splashy dinner at the famed Peninsular Hotel to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collecting contemporary art in Hong Kong is a new phenomenon, and the absence of a good museum infrastructure has not helped develop tastes. In addition, there is a strong overlap with the luxury goods market, aided and abetted by the companies&rsquo; own thrust into the art world: vodka, cigars, watches, cars and champagne were actively present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, particularly popular were &lsquo;brand names&rsquo;. Eighteen works by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, whose profile was immensely enhanced after she collaborated with the Louis Vuitton shops, flew out of the Victoria Miro stand at prices of up to $2m. The Los Angeles gallery Blum and Poe did well with the Japanese artists Yoshitomo Nara and Takashi Murakami &ndash; who of course designed handbags for Vuitton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese artists were popular, and MadeIn Company&rsquo;s Play 201301, 2013, a Gothic cathedral hung by ropes from the ceiling and made of bondage-style black leather, zips, chains and tassels, sold to the Australian White Rabbit museum for $325,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales at the fair were strong overall, and at the weekend Christie&rsquo;s racked up almost $100m in two auctions of contemporary Chinese art. While the Warhols apparently didn&rsquo;t sell well, there is little doubt in most people&rsquo;s minds that China has a more than auspicious future for the art trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Cash registers ring the changes for Chinas art market","HeadlineShort":"Art in China: Down but not out","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"China became the worlds largest art market in 2011  then sales plummeted.

And its position at the heart of the region, close to Russia, the Middle East as well as Europe, makes it a hub.&rdquo; He felt it was time Istanbul had a truly international fair, bringing foreign buyers into Turkey and facilitating the opening up of the country to foreign galleries, to promote &ndash; and sell &ndash; their international artists. And he timed it to coincide with the well-respected Istanbul Biennial. &ldquo;Everyone was enthusiastic,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey is one of the newest emerging markets for art. It has a small group of extremely wealthy collectors, who are buying international as well as domestic contemporary art and creating museums. The Ko&ccedil; family, for example, has its own foundation and plans to open a museum in 2016: it will show 800 works of art. The Eczacibasi family already has its own museum, Istanbul Modern, as does the Sabanci family, currently devoting its art centre to a show by Anish Kapoor. At auction, the first half of this year already saw $25.5m (&pound;16m) spent on Turkish and Middle Eastern artists, according to the art data site Artprice.com &ndash; already close to the total of $35.5m (&pound;22.1m) spent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripples of protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However this rosy scenario darkened dramatically this summer, when a series of protests rippled through the country after a brutal police crackdown on demonstrations in Taksim Square. &ldquo;Many of my exhibitors wanted to pull out then and there,&rdquo; says Angus. While the wave of protests died down, they have not gone away &ndash; a 35-year-old sound technician died this month from, his family say, the effects of tear-gas, with his death triggering silent sit-ins in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a threatened bombing in Syria, the US State Department issued a warning to its citizens not to travel to Turkey &ndash; just before the fair opened, while the Turkish lira had already plunged in value. &ldquo;Just everything seemed to be going wrong,&rdquo; said the US dealer Wendy Norris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to prise open a new market was tough in other ways, as Angus learnt to his cost. The Biennial organisers demanded that the fair should start on a Sunday, four days after their opening, because they wanted to distance it from their own non-commercial event. The effect was to discourage some international visitors from staying on. Fierce competition came from Istanbul&rsquo;s existing art fair, Contemporary Istanbul (CI), held in November: it grabbed most of the available public advertising space for its own fair, despite it being two months away &ndash; to catch the international visitors to the Biennial, the organisers said. They also took the new fair to court at the last minute, claiming it had breached their copyright by using the name ArtInternational Istanbul, and obtained that the &lsquo;Istanbul&rsquo; should be dropped from the title. This meant all the material, from tickets to the catalogues, had to be reprinted at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it must have been bad luck that the whole fair entrance had to be taken down and then rebuilt the day before the opening, because of a visit to the site by the Turkish prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right on the night?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, the fair went ahead with 62 dealers, including some major names such as Pace, Lisson and Yvon Lambert, and the first day attracted pretty well all the major collectors in the country. The fair director, Dyala Nusseibeh, has close links with the United Arab Emirates, where her father is a trusted advisor to the president, and a number of collectors from the Gulf were also in attendance, including Sheikha Hoor of Sharjah and Prince Fahad Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. &ldquo;There are bilateral trade agreements with Gulf states and a lot of Gulf investment here, so it&rsquo;s a natural draw,&rdquo; said Nusseibeh. While there were fewer Europeans, Caroline Bourgeois, curator for the luxury-goods mogul and collector Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault &ndash; who also owns Christie&rsquo;s &ndash; was trawling the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite all the fears that the economic slowdown and political unrest would kibosh business, sales were made, albeit at a low level. &ldquo;Istanbul is a great place to visit, and the city could be the hub for the whole region,&rdquo; said Norris: &ldquo;Anyway, I like risk taking.&rdquo; By the second day she had sold enough to cover her costs, so was happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ten Turkish galleries, inevitably, did well, with Moiz Zilberman celebrating making a slew of sales at the opening. And Tankut Aykut of the local Dirimart Gallery was optimistic: &ldquo;We had a horrible couple of months, but things are pretty well back to normal now. I don&rsquo;t think the troubles had a huge economic impact on the art trade here,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Anyway, Turkey is always a bit chaotic and hectic &ndash; that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angus is going ahead with next year&rsquo;s event: &ldquo;The instinct to set up an international fair of this calibre was emphatically justified,&rdquo; he said. Next year, though, he will change the opening dates and &ldquo;Put in much more concentrated effort on the north and east to achieve our ambitions of a comprehensive global art fair.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Georgina Adam reports on the business of art from established capitals and emerging cultural centres.","Name":"The Art Market","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"The Art Market","CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/column/the-art-market","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0a9a"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Art","Name":"Art","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Art"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:00:08.420623Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"290b9e17-8e10-40e1-95d4-131e16ddbe00","Id":"wwculture/section/art","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:17:46.114188Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/art"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/art","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0aac"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Against all odds: Turkeys newest art fair","HeadlineShort":"Against all odds: Art in Turkey","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Political unrest and bitter commercial rivalries almost derailed Turkeys newest art fair.

So expensive, in fact, that no-one even knows how much it could make. The multi-billion dollar collection of the Detroit Institute of Art (DIA), packed with masterpieces by Rembrandt, Picasso, Degas, van Gogh, and many other painters, as well as sculpture, furniture and ancient Greek pottery, is under real threat of ending up under the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a chorus of disapproval, Christie&rsquo;s has been called in to put a price on part of DIA&rsquo;s holdings, which comprise thousands of items. Just 40 of them, the greatest treasures, could be worth an eye-popping $2.5 billion, according to the Detroit Free Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because the city of Detroit is on the brink of bankruptcy, with an estimated $18 billion in debts. So it is looking at all its assets &ndash; which include the art &ndash; to see what it can sell off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit is an extreme, and tragic case: the art is literally irreplaceable. While its case is unique &ndash; the sale is by no means a done deal, and would be to pay the city&rsquo;s debts, not the DIA&rsquo;s own &ndash; it comes amid a mounting tide of museum disposals around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With museums staring at falling incomes and rising costs, the temptation to raid the basements is getting stronger. Also driving the trend is the current fashion for hip contemporary art: this month the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts announced it was off-loading one of its two paintings by Edward Hopper, to kick-start an acquisition fund for &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; contemporary art. So Hopper&rsquo;s East Wind over Weehawken, is going on the block at Christie&rsquo;s in December, with an estimate of $22m-$28m. Poignantly, the bleak street scene from 1934 features a sign scrawled in scarlet letters in the foreground &ndash; &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sale of the century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such disposals have been happening for years. To howls of disapproval, in 2007 the Albright-Knox museum in Buffalo, New York, sold some of its prize historic treasures to concentrate on what director Louis Grachos called its core mission, buying and showing the &ldquo;art of the present&rdquo;. A Roman period bronze sculpture of Artemis and the Stag was hammered down by Sotheby&rsquo;s New York for a lusty $28.6m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis, such sales have accelerated sharply. In 2011 alone, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Getty Center in LA, the Art Institute of Chicago and the New Jersey Historical Society all sold works at auction. In February this year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art dumped 16 Old Masters at Sotheby&rsquo;s, raising $2.4m, including $626,500 for a portrait by a follower of Rubens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, museum disposals are far rarer, in some countries, such as France, they are forbidden by law for works in national collections. In general, museum associations require that if works are sold, then the money raised must go towards other acquisitions rather than just fixing the plumbing. The global authority, the International Council of Museums is clear: &ldquo;Museum collections are held in public trust and may not be treated as a realisable asset,&rdquo; it states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arguments against such sales are many and convincing, with the notion of &ldquo;public trust&rdquo; being crucial: museums must be seen and trusted as institutions that are not blown here and there by the winds of fashion or by commercial considerations. The Hermitage Museum in Russia disposed of swathes of masterpieces in the 1930s, to ease its dire balance of payments problems; in the 1950s, Minneapolis became infamous for selling thousands of paintings, antiquities and Asian works of art. New York&rsquo;s Metropolitan Museum of Art caused an international scandal in the 1970s when it booted out Van Gogh, Modigliani, Picasso, Renoir and other works to buy David Smith and a Richard Diebenkorn. None of those institutions could afford to buy back those works now, even if they were available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another argument against selling off art is that it might deter future donors from gifting works, if they might one day end up in the saleroom. A few years ago a New York museum put up for sale a David Smith sculpture without even bothering to consult the donor &ndash; who was alive, well and furious when he heard it was going under the hammer. (The museum hastily backtracked and withdrew the work from auction.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upstairs, downstairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a counter argument to all this. Museums are not stuffed with masterpieces &ndash; far from it. Most have a few highlights and vast troves of works that are in poor condition, duplicates and never on show. Even the exacting American Association of Art Museum Directors accepts sales when there is an effort to &ldquo;refine and improve&rdquo; a collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when works sold by museums are substandard, they command premium prices, thanks to the prestigious label of the institution &ndash; even if no longer wanted. The auction houses are frantic to sell any cast-offs, knowing that buyers will be prepared to push up prices more than for a work without such a provenance. In the case of Detroit, with its tip-top collection, any sale would be sure to shatter the record books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many fear that the current round of disposals might prove short-sighted. There is increasing pressure on museums to show flashy new art, to bring in a new, younger and more diverse public. But contemporary art prices are at an all-time high, forcing institutions to dig deeper into their pockets to acquire what may&nbsp; prove to be today&rsquo;s firework, but tomorrow&rsquo;s damp squib &ndash; and an expensive one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Detroits art sell-off: Flogging the family silver?","HeadlineShort":"Detroit: Art treasures for sale?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Georgina Adam looks at the temptation for museums to raid their treasure chests to pay the bills  or buy new trophy art.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Georgina Adam looks at the temptation for museums to raid their treasure chests to pay the bills  or buy new trophy art.","SummaryShort":"When museums flog the family silver","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"212f0fdd-d701-4860-b9fd-1658a2aa6181","Id":"wwculture/story/20130909-detroit-art-treasures-for-sale","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20130909-detroit-art-treasures-for-sale"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20130909-detroit-art-treasures-for-sale","_id":"559a69c0bed0a737e5de8ca7"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;German and Israeli police made dramatic swoops last month, raiding dozens of premises and arresting six people in Germany and 18 in Israel as part of a massive bust on a suspected art forgery ring. According to the police, the band was responsible for faking at least 400 works of art by highly-prized Russian artists and dumping them on the market. Among them were two paintings, worth an eye-popping 2m euros ($2.6m), that had been sold through a now defunct German gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only two years ago German police had smashed another forgery ring, which for decades had been producing rip-off works of European modernist artists such as Fernand L&eacute;ger and Georges Braque. The counterfeiter, Wolfgang Beltracchi, is currently serving a six-year jail sentence for his activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in the US, a huge scandal is swirling around dozens of works sold through the Knoedler Gallery, one of New York&rsquo;s oldest art dealers. It suddenly snapped shut last year after accusations that it had been selling phoney works by the highest-priced American painters &ndash; Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning among others. No fewer than six lawsuits &ndash; one for $50m &ndash; by former clients have been brought against the gallery, which denies any wrongdoing. And these cases are just the tip of an immense criminal iceberg of art forgery, which police estimate is now worth billions of dollars a year. So worrying is the problem that Interpol held its first conference on the subject last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scam artists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the current escalation in faking are not difficult to identify. With the massive rise in the value of art, the temptation to get a chunk of the action is obvious. And the price hikes are overwhelmingly in the field of 20th-Century art &ndash; which is much easier to fake than the Old Masters. For older works, unmasking forgeries is getting easier, thanks to advances in dating techniques and technical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ancient artefacts are very hard to date. Stone is old, so the only analysis can be to search for traces of pigment &ndash; or work out if mechanical tools were used. And yet the whole British art world was humiliated in 2006 when a family living in a modest council house in Bolton in the north of England produced an alabaster statuette and sold it to the local museum for over &pound;500,000 ($750,000) as a 14th-Century BC Egyptian antiquity. Before the scam was exposed, the &lsquo;Amarna Princess&rsquo; had been authenticated by the British Museum, sold through Christie&rsquo;s auction house, funded by two national bodies, accepted for a tax break and published as a major acquisition in venerable art journal, &lt;a href=\"http://www.burlington.org.uk/\"&gt;The Burlington Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provenance &ndash; the history of a piece &ndash; is all-important in persuading buyers something is genuine, and the Bolton fakers had also manufactured a long trail of documents. Other forgers have seized on the golden opportunity offered by the massive disruption of two world wars. In the recent case in Germany works by Natalia Goncharova and Wassily Kandinsky were targeted. Amir Kabiri, president of the MT Abraham Foundation, which owns Russian avant-garde works of art, explains: &ldquo;From 1932 until the Perestroika period, avant-garde art was banned from being traded, collected or exhibited. This encouraged forgers to fabricate provenances during that period of 50 years, since very few records, if at all, existed.\" Since the fall of communism, Russian buyers have been clamouring to buy back their heritage &ndash; and have the resources to do so. The world record for a Kandinsky now stands at over $20m and for a Goncharova at over $10m, so the potential pickings for a forger are juicy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyer beware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is easy to understand why fakers are so busily at work, what is more puzzling is how gullible the buyers are. The answer often comes back to the same motivation as the counterfeiters themselves: greed, or the temptation to grab a bargain. &ldquo;We are never more likely to be vulnerable to a cheat than when we ourselves are trying to diddle someone out of a masterpiece,&rdquo; wrote the critic James Fenton in 2007. Dodgy works are often temptingly priced, and instead of alarm bells ringing, people think they have got lucky and decide to pounce before someone else does. And they are not always wrong: genuine bargains do indeed turn up in garage sales or go unrecognised in country auctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Marinello of the Art Loss Register, an international database of stolen and missing works, adds: &ldquo;Buyers refuse to perform even the most basic due diligence before spending a fortune on fine art; they will often spend more than the cost of a house without doing any pre-purchase reconnaissance.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting something is another powerful motivation, leading buyers to ignore the evidence under their own noses. Nazi leader Hermann Goering, who was determined to build the greatest art collection in Europe, paid a mighty 1.6m guilders (about $8m today) for Christ with the Adulteress, by the famed Dutch painter Jan Vermeer, in 1943. It was in fact by the drink- drug-addled forger Han van Meegeren (1889-1947. Despite the work being a blatant fake &ndash; to modern eyes &ndash; Goering badly wanted a Vermeer for his collection. In the Bolton case, the museum that bought it was desperate to add the statue to its display of Egyptian antiquities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this is compounded by the problem of expertise: before Van Meegeren was unmasked, many experts had proclaimed that his forgeries were masterpieces. Even for modern works, the specialists don&rsquo;t necessarily agree. Christie&rsquo;s for instance, still believes that a painting of a buxom nude, which it sold to a Russian oligarch in 2005, is by the 19th century artist Boris Kustodiev. However after a bitter legal battle, which saw experts on both sides have their say, the court decided that &ldquo;on balance&rdquo; it thought it was not; Christie&rsquo;s was ordered to refund the buyer and had to pay an extra &pound;1m ($1.5m) in costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is deeply worrying in all this is how many undetected fakes are still out there. Beltracchi was only prosecuted for 14 forgeries &ndash; he has stated that he faked hundreds of other works, but refuses to give more details. As the artist Th&eacute;odore Rousseau once said: &ldquo;We can only talk about the bad forgeries, the ones that have been detected; the good ones are still hanging on the walls.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The art of deception: How forgers get away with it","HeadlineShort":"Forgery: The art of deception","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"As police smash yet another counterfeit ring, Georgina Adam looks at why this billion-dollar business is growing  and why buyers are so easily taken in.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"As police smash yet another counterfeit ring, Georgina Adam looks at why this billion-dollar business is growing  and why buyers are so easily taken in.","SummaryShort":"How counterfeiters get away with it","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"99284a77-1086-4741-b8d8-c86c93a11822","Id":"wwculture/story/20130709-the-art-of-deception","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20130709-the-art-of-deception"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20130709-the-art-of-deception","_id":"559a69bcbed0a737e5de8bf6"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;In an appointment that astonished the art market, it has emerged that, Princess Eugenie, granddaughter of Britain&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II, will work at an online auction house. Her arrival at Paddle8, which sells art over the internet, is the latest in a series of ambitious moves for the firm, which has recently landed $6m in funding from a series of investors, including big-name art world players Damien Hirst and Jay Jopling, owner of the leading gallery, White Cube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paddle8, founded just over two years ago, is one of a series of start-up ventures currently battling for a slice of the potentially lucrative market for selling art online, which Chris Vroom, founder of another dotcom, Artspace, estimates at an eye-popping $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of players are now jostling for space in this field, with the most high-profile being Artsy.net, which has attracted glamorous backers such as Wendi Deng, the soon-to-be-divorced wife of the Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, and Dasha Zhukova, partner of billionaire Roman Abramovich. Artsy aims to do for art what online radio station Pandora did for music, by finding out users&rsquo; tastes and recommending other works they might like. Founded in 2008 and launched in 2012, Artsy has attracted $12m in investment and has 150,000 registered users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another start-up, Artspace, has bagged $13m in just two years and has just hired the billionaire heiress and art collector Maria Baibakova as its artistic director. Most of the sites include an educational component, from curators&rsquo; selections to blogs and articles about art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big bids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At auction, the world record for a work of art sold over the internet now stands at almost $10m &ndash; for a painting by the American artist Edward Hopper. It sold at Christie&rsquo;s New York in November last year, during a live sale in the auction house. While the price is not yet in the biggest league, where the $100m barrier is increasingly being smashed, it nevertheless represents a major step forward in selling art online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various ways websites sell art. Some, such as Artsy, &lsquo;lead&rsquo; potential buyers to art galleries and take a percentage on the sale price, relying on the dealers to play ball and report them. Artspace &ndash; with 200,000 users &ndash; works on a straightforward e-commerce model: you click on a work of art to buy it. Paddle8 follows the auction model, where users bid online for pieces that have been curated by the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many sites are in what is fetchingly called &lsquo;pre-revenue&rsquo; mode, meaning they are not yet making money and ploughing their cash back into building the business. This the case for Artsy: as with internet start-ups in other sectors, a lot is riding on potential rather than profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going digital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the auction houses, particularly Christie&rsquo;s, have been aggressively promoting internet sales, and Christie&rsquo;s online-only auction of works by Andy Warhol last year raised almost $2.3m for everything from a screen-printed T-shirt&nbsp; to photographs. It is currently selling a series of homoerotic works by Warhol online that the auction house describes as &ldquo;intimate&rdquo;, until 27 June. The firm is also coy about disclosing how much it actually sells online, as is Sotheby&rsquo;s, but in the US, the Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, which specialises in coins, jewellery, arms and other collecting categories, says that up to 85% of its business now comes from online sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question is the extent to which art sales will migrate onto the web, particularly at the high end. Inevitably, some of the founders of art sales sites believe, in an almost evangelistic way, that the web is the future and that even very high-priced works of art will eventually sell online. But not everyone agrees. While the volume market seems sure to grow, the high end will probably be more difficult to crack. Paddle8, for example, has decided to specialise in works under $100,000 and its average sale price is $10,000. Vroom of Artspace says that the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; is $25,000- $30,000; after that, &ldquo;you need human mediation&rdquo;, meaning that you actually have to see the art before taking the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying a very expensive work of art is not just about acquiring a product; it is also about the jet-setting lifestyle it brings with it: the pleasure of being courted by the floppy-haired specialists who work for the auction houses, the testosterone-fuelled atmosphere of the saleroom or the intense partying of the art fairs. And that is a lot more fun than sitting at home in your pyjamas, clicking away on your computer. But, says Vroom, &ldquo;I believe that long term, we will see 15%-20% of the upper end of the market move onto the internet. There&rsquo;s a $10 billion- $15 billion opportunity out there, but it will take 10 or 12 years to realise.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Buying art online: A click away from a masterpiece?","HeadlineShort":"A click away from a masterpiece?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"New start-ups and established players are turning digital to sell art online.

The provocative Californian artist Paul McCarthy is installing WS, a whacky forest inspired by Grimm&rsquo;s fairy tales and American mythology, featuring towering trees, warped houses and grotesque videos showing lurid images unsuitable for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take 17 massive trucks just to bring in everything for the show. McCarthy is not, of course, a stranger to size &ndash; he produced the towering, 80-ft (24-m) high Balloon Dog just two months ago, in time for the Frieze New York art fair. At the same time his gallery, Hauser &amp; Wirth, used its own vast new gallery in Chelsea &ndash; the former Roxy roller skating rink &ndash; to show more of his oversized work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigantism has well and truly arrived in the art world, and in the market. At Art Basel last week, Art Unlimited, the section for XXL artworks, was even bigger than in previous years, and now boasts 11,500 sq m (123,785 sq ft) of floor space. There you could walk into whole installations &ndash; for example a room-sized cat&rsquo;s cradle of black threads, chairs and a scorched grand piano, by the Japanese-born Chiharu Shiota. Or admire a giant multi-coloured balloon by the Benin artist Meschac Gaba, before trying to take in the largest painting ever shown in the section - Matt Mullican&rsquo;s 22m x 7m (72 ft x 23 ft) Two into One becomes Three, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflated prices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead towards oversized art was taken by state institutions &ndash; in London, the Turbine Hall at the Tate Gallery offers 3,400 sq m (36,597 sq ft) for an artist&rsquo;s project. But that size now pales beside what&rsquo;s coming up in the Guggenheim museum being built in Abu Dhabi, which will have 11 such spaces for artists&rsquo; commissions. In Paris, the Monumenta project in the vast nave of the Grand Palais saw it filled in 2011 with Anish Kapoor&rsquo;s Leviathan, a giant inflatable bubble-like structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for big has certainly stimulated the current trend for inflatable art. Blow-up works can be deflated, for storage and transport, but once erected can be immense. One particularly egregious example is Mark Quinn&rsquo;s Alison Lapper Pregnant, a lilac-hued reiteration of the statue that was originally conceived for the fourth plinth in London&rsquo;s Trafalgar Square. Towering outside the 16th century church of San Giorgio Maggiore as part of an exhibition of the British artist&rsquo;s work at the Venice Biennale, the piece&rsquo;s only virtue seems to be its sheer size, which jars shockingly with the Palladian architecture of its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who buys these monster creations? They won&rsquo;t fit in anyone&rsquo;s living room, that&rsquo;s for sure, but they are not intended for them either. The answer is very simple: public projects but more importantly, private art spaces. These have become the &lsquo;must haves&rsquo; of many of the wealthiest people in the world, and are driving the market for contemporary art today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors like Dasha Zhukova, partner of billionaire Roman Abramovich have space, money and ambition. And they like works with high visual impact, with the &lsquo;wow&rsquo; factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the massive enrichment of the world, there are more alpha collectors than you might think. A small guide just published by Hatje Cantz lists 173 of these spaces, all set up by private collectors to show their art. They span the world, from Argentina to the Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some spaces are on a very large scale: for example, in Inhotim, Brazil, the mining billionaire Bernardo Paz has 5,000 acres (217,800,000 sq ft) to show his mainly commissioned artworks. To put this in perspective: London&rsquo;s Tate Modern has a total internal floor area of 8.5 acres (370,260 sq ft). Rumour has it that Inhotim is where Anish Kapoor&rsquo;s Leviathan will eventually be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christie&rsquo;s owner, the luxury-goods mogul Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault, has two museums in Venice to fill with his holdings: during the Venice Biennale, he unveiled two huge paintings by the Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi, filling the central cube in La Dogana, one of these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commercial world is also super-sizing up. Dealers such as Zwirner, Hauser &amp; Wirth and White Cube are extending their spaces by acquiring new buildings. And of course bigger art sells for more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globalisation has also had an impact on bigger art. Production costs would be prohibitive in the west for some projects, such as Ai Weiwei&rsquo;s installation of sunflower seeds in Tate Modern in 2010. The 100 million seeds were hand-painted in China, something that could never have been done in the West. A number of Western artists now have studios in China, for example the Belgian Wim Delvoye or the American Kehinde Wiley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether bigger is better is another debate, but there&rsquo;s little doubt that &lsquo;small is beautiful&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t on today&rsquo;s art market agenda. Just ask Paul McCarthy, as he installs the 700 sq m (7,534 sq ft) sculpture at the centre of the WS show&hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why size matters in the art world","HeadlineShort":"Why size matters in art","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Absolutely massive works of art are all the rage among collectors, galleries and museums, reports Georgina Adam.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Monstrously large works are all the rage among collectors, galleries and museums, reports Georgina Adam.","SummaryShort":"The gigantic works that everyone wants","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"9c52a4cf-3deb-4fe9-a86e-0faf3169aa90","Id":"wwculture/story/20130617-why-size-matters-in-art","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20130617-why-size-matters-in-art"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20130617-why-size-matters-in-art","_id":"559a69bbbed0a737e5de8bba"}],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Political unrest and bitter commercial rivalry almost derailed Turkeys newest art fair.

So expensive, in fact, that no-one even knows how much it could make. The multi-billion dollar collection of the Detroit Institute of Art (DIA), packed with masterpieces by Rembrandt, Picasso, Degas, van Gogh, and many other painters, as well as sculpture, furniture and ancient Greek pottery, is under real threat of ending up under the auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a chorus of disapproval, Christie&rsquo;s has been called in to put a price on part of DIA&rsquo;s holdings, which comprise thousands of items. Just 40 of them, the greatest treasures, could be worth an eye-popping $2.5 billion, according to the Detroit Free Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because the city of Detroit is on the brink of bankruptcy, with an estimated $18 billion in debts. So it is looking at all its assets &ndash; which include the art &ndash; to see what it can sell off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit is an extreme, and tragic case: the art is literally irreplaceable. While its case is unique &ndash; the sale is by no means a done deal, and would be to pay the city&rsquo;s debts, not the DIA&rsquo;s own &ndash; it comes amid a mounting tide of museum disposals around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With museums staring at falling incomes and rising costs, the temptation to raid the basements is getting stronger. Also driving the trend is the current fashion for hip contemporary art: this month the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts announced it was off-loading one of its two paintings by Edward Hopper, to kick-start an acquisition fund for &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; contemporary art. So Hopper&rsquo;s East Wind over Weehawken, is going on the block at Christie&rsquo;s in December, with an estimate of $22m-$28m. Poignantly, the bleak street scene from 1934 features a sign scrawled in scarlet letters in the foreground &ndash; &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sale of the century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such disposals have been happening for years. To howls of disapproval, in 2007 the Albright-Knox museum in Buffalo, New York, sold some of its prize historic treasures to concentrate on what director Louis Grachos called its core mission, buying and showing the &ldquo;art of the present&rdquo;. A Roman period bronze sculpture of Artemis and the Stag was hammered down by Sotheby&rsquo;s New York for a lusty $28.6m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis, such sales have accelerated sharply. In 2011 alone, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Getty Center in LA, the Art Institute of Chicago and the New Jersey Historical Society all sold works at auction. In February this year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art dumped 16 Old Masters at Sotheby&rsquo;s, raising $2.4m, including $626,500 for a portrait by a follower of Rubens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, museum disposals are far rarer, in some countries, such as France, they are forbidden by law for works in national collections. In general, museum associations require that if works are sold, then the money raised must go towards other acquisitions rather than just fixing the plumbing. The global authority, the International Council of Museums is clear: &ldquo;Museum collections are held in public trust and may not be treated as a realisable asset,&rdquo; it states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arguments against such sales are many and convincing, with the notion of &ldquo;public trust&rdquo; being crucial: museums must be seen and trusted as institutions that are not blown here and there by the winds of fashion or by commercial considerations. The Hermitage Museum in Russia disposed of swathes of masterpieces in the 1930s, to ease its dire balance of payments problems; in the 1950s, Minneapolis became infamous for selling thousands of paintings, antiquities and Asian works of art. New York&rsquo;s Metropolitan Museum of Art caused an international scandal in the 1970s when it booted out Van Gogh, Modigliani, Picasso, Renoir and other works to buy David Smith and a Richard Diebenkorn. None of those institutions could afford to buy back those works now, even if they were available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another argument against selling off art is that it might deter future donors from gifting works, if they might one day end up in the saleroom. A few years ago a New York museum put up for sale a David Smith sculpture without even bothering to consult the donor &ndash; who was alive, well and furious when he heard it was going under the hammer. (The museum hastily backtracked and withdrew the work from auction.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upstairs, downstairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a counter argument to all this. Museums are not stuffed with masterpieces &ndash; far from it. Most have a few highlights and vast troves of works that are in poor condition, duplicates and never on show. Even the exacting American Association of Art Museum Directors accepts sales when there is an effort to &ldquo;refine and improve&rdquo; a collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when works sold by museums are substandard, they command premium prices, thanks to the prestigious label of the institution &ndash; even if no longer wanted. The auction houses are frantic to sell any cast-offs, knowing that buyers will be prepared to push up prices more than for a work without such a provenance. In the case of Detroit, with its tip-top collection, any sale would be sure to shatter the record books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many fear that the current round of disposals might prove short-sighted. There is increasing pressure on museums to show flashy new art, to bring in a new, younger and more diverse public. But contemporary art prices are at an all-time high, forcing institutions to dig deeper into their pockets to acquire what may&nbsp; prove to be today&rsquo;s firework, but tomorrow&rsquo;s damp squib &ndash; and an expensive one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Georgina Adam reports on the business of art from established capitals and emerging cultural centres.","Name":"The Art Market","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"The Art Market","CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/column/the-art-market","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0a9a"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Art","Name":"Art","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Art"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:00:08.420623Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"290b9e17-8e10-40e1-95d4-131e16ddbe00","Id":"wwculture/section/art","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:17:46.114188Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/art"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/art","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0aac"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:10:15Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Detroits art sell-off: Flogging the family silver?","HeadlineShort":"Detroit: Art treasures for sale?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Georgina Adam looks at the temptation for museums to raid their treasure chests to pay the bills  or buy new trophy art.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":[],"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"gallery","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;Imagine Las Vegas casino owner Steve Wynn&rsquo;s horror when, seven years ago, he accidentally put his elbow through Picasso&rsquo;s painting Le R&ecirc;ve (The Dream), just as he was about to sell it for an eye-popping $139m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The painting is one of a series of sensuous portraits of the artist&rsquo;s young mistress Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Walter, painted in 1932 during their torrid affair. Such works are among the most desirable by Picasso and the price would have set a new high for the artist &ndash; but with the painting punctured, the buyer, billionaire hedge fund mogul Steve Cohen, called off the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after a skillful repair, the sale has finally gone through, but this time for $150m, setting a new record for Picasso as well as being the highest price any American collector has ever paid for a work of art. This was a private sale, and at auction records are also being shattered: last year in New York, Edvard Munch&rsquo;s The Scream made almost $120m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of the world is mired in economic gloom, the art market &ndash; which regularly sees multi-million prices set for paintings and sculpture &ndash; seems to be living in a parallel universe. Le R&ecirc;ve just one example of how values are spiralling upwards, driven by new money, newly emerged economies, speculation and a fashion for art that overlaps with lifestyle choices and the luxury goods industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seemingly gravity-defying art market also reflects the nature of wealth today. The sheer amount of money in private hands allows billionaires &ndash; and there are, at the last count according to Forbes, 1,426 of them spread throughout the world &ndash; to indulge in a highly competitive sport to bag the best artworks. And after all, if you can spend nearly $1bn on a yacht, as the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is supposed to have spent on his floating palace Eclipse, another few millions for a trophy picture is not that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you can build another yacht, you can&rsquo;t get a top Manet, C&eacute;zanne or Raphael made for you &ndash; you have to vie with other collectors when one appears on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A changing picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a market which has, over the last 25 years, seen a massive growth in size. According to art economist Dr Clare McAndrew, in a report published in 2012, about $27.2bn worth of art was sold through dealers and auction houses in 1990. By 2007, at the peak of the last boom, this figure had almost tripled, to $65.8bn. In 2012, according to her latest findings, it was still worth a stunning $56bn, despite shrinking slightly compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as expanding, the business of selling art has been profoundly modified by the arrival of new economies. This is now a global market, no longer dominated by the US and Europe and by American and European artists. Just two years ago, in the grip of sometimes extravagant spending on art in mainland China &ndash; and probably aided by some optimistic reporting &ndash; China leapfrogged into the top position, with the highest total in this field. While it has now fallen back to the number two slot, China and Hong Kong still represent 25% of art sales, with only the US ahead, with 33%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works of art have been sold in China at levels that used to be reserved for the top Western names. For instance an 11th century calligraphy scroll by Huang Tingjian sold recently for a stunning $63.8m in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fashion for private and indeed state-sponsored museums has also been driving the top end of the market - Gulf states, particularly Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, have been eagerly acquiring works of art for ambitious museum programmes. The Qatari royal family, notably Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani, daughter of the Emir, has been extremely active, and is thought to be the biggest buyer in the world today. What does she buy? Mainly modern and contemporary art, and Qatar is generally thought to have paid the highest price ever for an artwork &ndash; $250m in 2011 for C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s The Card Players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparity in fortunes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying art, for many of today&rsquo;s newly wealthy, also gives access to a glamorous lifestyle. There is an endless round of art fairs, biennales, auctions and events all over the world to attend, where galleries and auction houses put on the most glittering parties. Fashion magazines, luxury goods and watch companies pile in, as well as banks, who are increasingly watching art as a new asset class. In some countries such as China or India, art buying is considered first and foremost for investment, rather than for passion or as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flip side of all this is polarisation, with a small crust of very rich people driving the market, pushing up prices for a handful of &rsquo;blue-chip&rsquo; artists and enriching a few big galleries and a few auction houses. Further down the scale, however, the middle and lower ends of the market are far less buoyant. So while the overall picture seems rosy, in fact it disguises increasing disparity in fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly in the mid-market, some galleries are closing, and many are having a hard time. The London gallery Hotel, despite its high reputation as a cutting-edge space, went into liquidation last year. More recently, gallerists Nicole Klagsbrun in New York and J&eacute;r&ocirc;me de Noirmont have started to work differently and have abandoned their showrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art, sadly, seems to have become much more of a rich man&rsquo;s game. And while the appetite for big names such as Picasso and works like Le R&ecirc;ve seems unquenchable for the moment, things are not necessarily so dreamy for younger and lesser-known artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-05-02T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why is art so expensive?","HeadlineShort":"Why is art so expensive?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"While the world economy languishes, paintings and sculpture continue to command dizzying prices.

Balloon Dog, an inflatable &ldquo;puppy&rdquo; standing 80 feet tall, was installed on New York&rsquo;s Randall&rsquo;s Island at the entrance to the Frieze art fair at the beginning of this month. The work of the provocative Californian artist Paul McCarthy, the sculpture was just one of many startling works put on show during the event, which specialises in cutting-edge contemporary art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to launch a New York version of London&rsquo;s Frieze art fair last year was greeted with outrage in some quarters. &ldquo;A British invasion!&rdquo; screeched some observers, while others sneered that the choice of location &ndash; an island in the East River to the north of Manhattan, which few New Yorkers had ever set foot on &ndash; would be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How wrong they were. From the start, the long white tent built for the fair, with its bright natural lighting, proved an excellent showcase for the art. New Yorkers took to the ferry service like &ndash; well, like ducks to water and the catering was excellent &ndash; always important in a fair, particularly if it is in an out-of-the-way location. But faced with an untried new event, there was some caution on the part of the dealers, and many played it safe by bringing uncontroversial art &ndash; such as big abstract paintings, often the easiest pieces to sell at a fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolder choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, exhibitors were much bolder in their choices. One smash hit was Ann Lee, a 2011 work by the Turner Prize-nominated performance artist Tino Sehgal. Visitors queued patiently to enter a plain white booth to talk with a child actor. Speaking like a robot with a faintly metallic voice, making slightly jerky gestures, the child explained that she had escaped from a video game and had become three-dimensional. I asked if I could photograph her, but she replied: &ldquo;Tino doesn&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo; Sehgal is famed for refusing any recording of his work and sale contracts have to be memorised. They do sell though, and while the gallery, the famed Marian Goodman, did not give prices, these are thought to be about $100,000, which buys ownership of the performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another booth was dominated by sculptures of food by the American artist Tom Friedman. A giant plaster pizza hanging on the wall could have been yours for $270,000, except that a collector snapped it up on the first day. Leaning against Perrotin&rsquo;s stand was a realistically sculpted woman, her head hidden in a scarf, by the French artist Daniel Firman. Linda, 2012, sold immediately for $32,500. Valeska Soares&rsquo; Finale, 2013, a mirrored table loaded with coloured crystal glasses, was bagged by the Miami-based Cisneros Foundation for $120,000 from the Fortes Vila&ccedil;a gallery. Overall, dealers were delighted with the brisk business at the fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freezing out the competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Frieze New York&rsquo;s very success is threatening to redraw the city&rsquo;s entire art fair landscape. Until Frieze arrived the leading fair was the long-running Armory Show, held in March on two unwelcoming piers on the Hudson River. Other smaller fairs clustered around it - but with the emergence of Frieze, many have now moved their dates to May. The Armory Show itself is in flux, as it is up for sale. Frieze, deliberately or not &ndash; and its owners deny that they were specifically gunning for the March event - has &ldquo;parked its tanks on the Armory lawn&rdquo; as one dealer put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further boosting the fair this year were its dates (9-13 May), which fell right between two key weeks in the New York auction calendar, when the major impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales were held at Sotheby&rsquo;s, Christie&rsquo;s and Phillips. This meant that top collectors were in town, among them London&rsquo;s Anita Zabludowicz, the Californian couple Norah and Norman Stone and the Italian designer Valentino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the weekend was well chosen for a Sunday barbecue given by billionaire publisher and collector Peter Brant in his vast Greenwich, Connecticut property. The occasion was the inauguration of a show of Andy Warhol pieces. Brant is a major buyer and trader of Warhol&rsquo;s work, and has put many of his most significant holdings into a foundation in his name, housed in a beautifully restored barn on the property. Amusingly, hanging over the fireplace in the entrance to the building is a sculpture by the art world&rsquo;s agent provocateur Maurizio Cattelan. It depicts Stephanie Seymour, Brant&rsquo;s wife and former Victoria&rsquo;s Secret model, naked to the waist and with flowing hair, like a ship&rsquo;s figurehead. Or like a trophy....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 16 lambs &ndash; specially imported from Argentina &ndash; roasting on spits, the party attracted just about the whole art world, from collectors such as the Rubells of Miami to the major dealer Larry Gagosian. As they looked over the immaculate and extensive lawns the guests swapped the latest gossip, hotly denied by the organisers of course, that Frieze might also be planning to import its Masters fair, for ancient, classic and modern art made prior to 2000. Perhaps the British invasion is not over yet. As for Balloon Dog, by fair end it was still looking for a new owner...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-05-13T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Frieze gets bolder at 2013 New York art fair","HeadlineShort":"80ft balloon dog seeks new owner","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"When New Yorks Frieze festival opened in 2012, some decried a British invasion.

Such works are among the most desirable by Picasso and the price would have set a new high for the artist &ndash; but with the painting punctured, the buyer, billionaire hedge fund mogul Steve Cohen, called off the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after a skillful repair, the sale has finally gone through, but this time for $150m, setting a new record for Picasso as well as being the highest price any American collector has ever paid for a work of art. This was a private sale, and at auction records are also being shattered: last year in New York, Edvard Munch&rsquo;s The Scream made almost $120m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of the world is mired in economic gloom, the art market &ndash; which regularly sees multi-million prices set for paintings and sculpture &ndash; seems to be living in a parallel universe. Le R&ecirc;ve just one example of how values are spiralling upwards, driven by new money, newly emerged economies, speculation and a fashion for art that overlaps with lifestyle choices and the luxury goods industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seemingly gravity-defying art market also reflects the nature of wealth today. The sheer amount of money in private hands allows billionaires &ndash; and there are, at the last count according to Forbes, 1,426 of them spread throughout the world &ndash; to indulge in a highly competitive sport to bag the best artworks. And after all, if you can spend nearly $1bn on a yacht, as the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is supposed to have spent on his floating palace Eclipse, another few millions for a trophy picture is not that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you can build another yacht, you can&rsquo;t get a top Manet, C&eacute;zanne or Raphael made for you &ndash; you have to vie with other collectors when one appears on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A changing picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a market which has, over the last 25 years, seen a massive growth in size. According to art economist Dr Clare McAndrew, in a report published in 2012, about $27.2bn worth of art was sold through dealers and auction houses in 1990. By 2007, at the peak of the last boom, this figure had almost tripled, to $65.8bn. In 2012, according to her latest findings, it was still worth a stunning $56bn, despite shrinking slightly compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as expanding, the business of selling art has been profoundly modified by the arrival of new economies. This is now a global market, no longer dominated by the US and Europe and by American and European artists. Just two years ago, in the grip of sometimes extravagant spending on art in mainland China &ndash; and probably aided by some optimistic reporting &ndash; China leapfrogged into the top position, with the highest total in this field. While it has now fallen back to the number two slot, China and Hong Kong still represent 25% of art sales, with only the US ahead, with 33%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works of art have been sold in China at levels that used to be reserved for the top Western names. For instance an 11th century calligraphy scroll by Huang Tingjian sold recently for a stunning $63.8m in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fashion for private and indeed state-sponsored museums has also been driving the top end of the market - Gulf states, particularly Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, have been eagerly acquiring works of art for ambitious museum programmes. The Qatari royal family, notably Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani, daughter of the Emir, has been extremely active, and is thought to be the biggest buyer in the world today. What does she buy? Mainly modern and contemporary art, and Qatar is generally thought to have paid the highest price ever for an artwork &ndash; $250m in 2011 for C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s The Card Players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparity in fortunes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying art, for many of today&rsquo;s newly wealthy, also gives access to a glamorous lifestyle. There is an endless round of art fairs, biennales, auctions and events all over the world to attend, where galleries and auction houses put on the most glittering parties. Fashion magazines, luxury goods and watch companies pile in, as well as banks, who are increasingly watching art as a new asset class. In some countries such as China or India, art buying is considered first and foremost for investment, rather than for passion or as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flip side of all this is polarisation, with a small crust of very rich people driving the market, pushing up prices for a handful of &rsquo;blue-chip&rsquo; artists and enriching a few big galleries and a few auction houses. Further down the scale, however, the middle and lower ends of the market are far less buoyant. So while the overall picture seems rosy, in fact it disguises increasing disparity in fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly in the mid-market, some galleries are closing, and many are having a hard time. The London gallery Hotel, despite its high reputation as a cutting-edge space, went into liquidation last year. More recently, gallerists Nicole Klagsbrun in New York and J&eacute;r&ocirc;me de Noirmont have started to work differently and have abandoned their showrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art, sadly, seems to have become much more of a rich man&rsquo;s game. And while the appetite for big names such as Picasso and works like Le R&ecirc;ve seems unquenchable for the moment, things are not necessarily so dreamy for younger and lesser-known artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Georgina Adam reports on the business of art from established capitals and emerging cultural centres.","Name":"The Art Market","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"The Art Market","CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"96295437-0883-478d-bc10-33d79ee7d170","Id":"wwculture/column/the-art-market","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:24:32.43291Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"column/the-art-market"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/column/the-art-market","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0a9a"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Art","Name":"Art","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Title":"Art"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:00:08.420623Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"290b9e17-8e10-40e1-95d4-131e16ddbe00","Id":"wwculture/section/art","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:17:46.114188Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"section/art"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwculture/section/art","_id":"559a6627bed0a737e5de0aac"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-05-02T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Why is art so expensive?","HeadlineShort":"Why is art so expensive?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"While the world economy languishes, paintings and sculpture continue to command dizzying prices.

In contrast, Lichtenstein was also inspired by the Secret Hearts comics, which dealt with women and romantic relationships.

The love for his own children, and compassion for the street children of Seville became an ongoing concern of Murillo&rsquo;s life and work.

His late uncle was Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, one of the most collected and distinguished Aboriginal painters.&nbsp; &lsquo;Warlugulong&rsquo;, his celebrated piece of acrylic on canvas that tells the tale of the power of a hallowed bushfire, was sold at auction for more than AUD$2 million in 2007.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Aboriginal artists, Raymond Walters Japanangka draws inspiration from those closest to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The foundation for a lot of my art is based on my spiritual upbringing, and my connection with my grandfather and grandmother&rsquo;s country and also my connection with our belief system and family. Acrylic paint and brushstrokes are just a way of expressing that,&rdquo; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancestral spirits also inspire the brushstrokes of veteran Aboriginal artist Bronwyn Bancroft as she depicts the divinity of the lands of her tribe, the Djanbun clan, in northern New South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A founding member of Boomalli, an Aboriginal artists&rsquo; collective in the Sydney suburb of Leichhardt, Bronwyn Bancroft surveys a gallery full of charcoal drawings, works in acrylic and art made from felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work is deeply personal and is &ldquo;drenched with symbolism&rdquo; as it explores an unbreakable connection to the earth.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We refer to them as the old people,&rdquo; she says of her forebears.&nbsp; &ldquo;They protect and guide me.&nbsp; My ancestors are my religion,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other indigenous painters, her paintings interpret traditional &lsquo;Dreamtime&rsquo; stories of creation, and the struggles and triumphs of Australia&rsquo;s first inhabitants.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home and away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indigenous art has become one of Australia&rsquo;s most potent cultural movements, full of brilliant iconography and mesmerising landscapes. &nbsp;It started to be marketed in the 1970s. A professor of art history at the University of Sydney, Roger Benjamin says the art &ldquo;offers buyers some kind of &rsquo;spiritual connection&rsquo; to the land in the world&rsquo;s most urbanised society [Australia].&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, surging demand from non-Aboriginal Australians, including wealthy collectors and investors, along with strong interest from overseas, has transformed a fledgling industry into a cultural phenomenon, appreciated by millions of people around Australia, and beyond.&nbsp; The art has become one of Australia&rsquo;s proudest exports, finding favour in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It has the kind of aura of sanctity about it,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Roger Benjamin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Almost every private home that I would visit,&rdquo; he says, speaking of friends and colleagues in Australia, &ldquo;would have some kind of Aboriginal art in it, and quite often original pieces.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;A lot of the dot paintings and the bark paintings from the Top End (the northern part of the Northern Territory) are windows into a very complicated culture that is based on religion and belief.&nbsp; So you also get a beautiful decoration for your wall but you also get some kind of connection to ancient ways of thinking that have disappeared from modern lifestyles,&rdquo; Prof. Benjamin tells BBC Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has unparalleled richness and regional diversity; from the use of ochre and bark by the people of the tropical savannahs to the acrylics popular in Central Australia, where, during tribal ceremonies, art decorated the ground or the bodies of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bright colours in Bronwyn Bancroft&rsquo;s work suggest a spirit of optimism, she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is emblematic of the survival of Aboriginal people. If we&rsquo;ve helped some of our wider audiences in Australia to appreciate that then we have done a good job,&rdquo; she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates vary, but the Aboriginal art industry is an economic powerhouse, and is worth around AUD$200 million each year, much going to impoverished communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sector has been buffeted by the global financial crisis, although academics such as Roger Benjamin say the market is beginning to recover.&nbsp; Sales to foreign tourists have been a significant driver of the industry, as is online trade, where dozens of indigenous communities dotted around the nation sell direct to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sydney&rsquo;s seaside resort of Manly, the Aboriginal Dreamtime Fine Art Gallery offers small original paintings by younger artists from AUD$20 alongside prize-winning works at&nbsp;$40,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The store is a delightful trove of colours, designs and styles from 18 Aboriginal community art cooperatives in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The popularity has grown immensely, especially in the last five to ten years.&nbsp; People that I meet all the time just want more and more Aboriginal art.&nbsp; Everyone wants a piece in their house,&rdquo; says Edwin Safarian, the gallery&rsquo;s director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Foreign tourists are a little overwhelmed by looking at the Aboriginal art.&nbsp; They find it quite intense and a lot to take in.&nbsp; We have people come in who are absolutely amazed by the quality of the art work,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of Aboriginal art as a modern cultural force is often traced to the dot paintings created by the desert people of Central Australia in the early 1970s.&nbsp; The epicentre was Papunya, 240 kilometres northwest of Alice Springs, which was established by the government to house Aborigines displaced from customary lands.&nbsp; Encouraged by a local teacher to paint on a blank school wall, the Papunya Tula Artists would radically change the way Australia and the rest of the world considered indigenous art in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Altman from the Australian National University says the trail-blazers of Papunya soon found a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Late modernism was probably looking for some new forms of art, and the Western Desert art really resonated because it was a link to people&rsquo;s connection to their ancestral lands, but at the same time appealed to a western aesthetic,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The godfathers of indigenous art at Papunya inspired generations of painters, including legions of younger urban artists whose work is often highly political, and makes strong statements about land rights, reconciliation and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Others who are dispossessed are making statements often about a lack of recognition, a lack of respect and a lack of compensation that they have received as marginalised indigenous peoples of Australia,&rdquo; Prof. Altman says.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borne out of poverty and dislocation from tribal lands, Australia&rsquo;s indigenous art gives non-Aborigines an invaluable window into a spellbinding culture where ancient spirits created the land, and where the Earth is revered as a living, breathing mass, full of secrets and wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each picture is a small, yet important part of a mosaic that tells the history of Australia&rsquo;s original inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-05-02T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Australias indigenous art: An economic colossus","HeadlineShort":"Going dotty for Aboriginal art","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Aboriginal people have long found spiritual inspiration for their art.

               <p>
                Relics, the biggest ever show of work by Damien Hirst, has just been unveiled in the tiny, energy-rich state of Qatar, in the Persian Gulf. As well as the provocative artists spot and spin paintings and his signature medicine cabinets, the show boasts the biggest pickled shark he has ever made, weighing in at a gargantuan 76 tons, and his diamond-encrusted skull, a piece that he once boasted was the most expensive artwork ever made by a living artist.
               </p>
               <p>
                The exhibition is being staged in Qatars capital Doha, in the Al Riwaq exhibition space, a building which has been covered with coloured dots for the occasion. But that is not all: outside an as-yet-unfinished medical centre, Hirst has placed The Miraculous Journey, a series of 14 massive bronze sculptures charting a foetus from conception to birth. The project cost a reported $20m.
               </p>
               <p>
                The sculptures are seen as highly controversial in Qatar, where shop mannequins still sometimes dont have heads, because of the Muslim unease with anything figurative. But they were ordered by the sister of the emir, Sheikha Al-Mayassa Al Thani, who is determinedly driving forward a culture programme which challenges traditional notions in the conservative Islamic state.
               </p>
               <p>
                As well as bringing a whole series of keynote exhibitions such as the Hirst to Qatar, the country has also underwritten exhibitions abroad. In 2010 it funded an exhibition by the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami in Versailles, which infuriated French purists, who felt that the artists colourful pop-meets-manga style was totally at odds with the graceful interiors of the hallowed palace. And last year Qatar stepped up to the plate for Hirst, underwriting his exhibition at Tate Modern.
               </p>
               <p>
                Each show was followed up by an even splashier rendering in Doha: Murakami last year, and Hirst now.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sheikha Al-Mayassa is not just sponsoring exhibitions. She is best known for being the biggest art buyer in the world, paying colossal sums to snap up the top artworks available on the market: some estimates suggest she is spending up to $1bn a year on art, although this figure may be exaggerated. Qatar never comments on its acquisitions, and all those who work with the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA), which is headed by the sheikha, sign stringent confidentiality contracts. But news inevitably filters out and it is reliably believed that she paid the highest price ever given for a work of art in 2011, acquiring Czannes 1895 version of The Card Players directly from its Greek owner for $250m. It was the last of the five paintings on the theme not already in a museum and is considered one of the most important works of art by the artist.
               </p>
               <p>
                As well as the Czanne, Qatar  the royal family or the QMA, its not quite clear  has snapped up works by Rothko, Hirst, Warhol and many other modern masters, paying huge prices at auction or through dealers.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Conspicuous consumption
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Persistent rumours in the past have maintained that Qatars sovereign fund was also interested in buying the auction house Christies. This would make sense, since actually owning the shop would give the country even better access to works of art for sale. And Qatar likes trophy assets: among its purchases are Harrods and the French football club Paris St-Germain, and it possesses substantial holdings in Volkswagen, Porsche and Tiffany. .
               </p>
               <p>
                However, while the Christies deal does not seem to have come off, the QMA has acquired some of its ex-employees: Edward Dolman, former CEO, is now in charge of Sheikha Al-Mayasssas office, while art specialist Jean-Paul Engelen is now director of the public art programme. He has been responsible for placing, among other works, a 17ft (5m) high statue by the artist Adel Abdessemed of the footballer Zinedine Zidane headbutting Marco Materazzi. This is now installed on Dohas waterfront.
               </p>
               <p>
                What remains something of a mystery is where all of the art Qatar is acquiring will go. It is hard to know for sure what is intended for the royal familys personal collection and what will go into a museum one day. Qatar already has one sensational showcase, the Museum of Islamic Art, designed by the famed Chinese-American architect IM Pei, who built the Louvre pyramid. Work continues day and night on the National Museum of Qatar, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, which is due to open at the end of next year. Mathaf, the Arab Museum of Modern Art, is up and running, as is the art space Al Riwaq, where the Hirst exhibition is being held. Other institutions are planned, and Dolman has often said, without offering more details, that Qatar will be producing some sensational surprises to coincide with the World Cup in 2022.

                Preparations for the World Cup, meanwhile, have projected Qatar into the news for another reason, and not one connected with art. Human Rights Watch has slammed the conditions of workers preparing the infrastructure for the countrys hosting of the 2022 World Cup, with Nepalese builders reported to be dying at the rate of one a day this summer. Such problems are not unusual in the region, where workers toil in conditions of near-slavery: nearby Abu Dhabi, which has its own ambitious museum building programme, has also been criticised for the same practices. In this case, the artists themselves called for a boycott of the projected Guggenheim museum until conditions were improved. In Qatar, however, there seems to have been no such disquiet so far.
