  <meta content="Some time in the future at Re-ed Camp 47 (some synopses put the year at 1995, but the film cannily avoids mentioning a date).
A trio of new arrivals are making their way to the camp by prison van. Paul (Steve Railsback) was a radical deviant caught red-handed broadcasting his deviant revolutionary thoughts to the world, while Chris (Olivia Hussey) foolishly attempted to intervene when the police were arresting another deviant in a jewellery store. And the third deviant, Rita, (Lynda Stoner) was said to be a whore, though she defiantly tells the other two she wasn't &hellip;
When they arrive at the camp, they're greeted by the whip-cracking, evil guard Red (Gus Mercurio) and soon enough they're meeting the camp commander Thatcher (Michael Craig), a smooth, suavely cold, thoroughly nasty chess-playing ruler, who shows the newcomers how the camp is run by having the vicious, bald-headed Ritter (Roger Ward) punch and kick deviant Melinda (Oriana Panozzo) into blood-saturated unconsciousness.
Thatcher has a couple of companions helping run the show. There's the visiting Secretary, Mallory, (Noel Ferrier), a fat, cigar-smoking cad who can't wait to get his hands on sweet Chris; the horse-riding and arrow-shooting sinister lesbian Jennifer (Carmen Duncan); and the suavely creepy villain Tito (Michael Petrovitch), who likes to hang around with a toe-chomping wolfman freak Alph (Steve Rackman), whom he found at a circus.
On the other side, there's a bespectacled, hapless loser Dodge (John Ley) and a tall desperate deviant who wants to kill Thatcher and escape, Griff (Bill Young), and a wannabee escapee, Andy (John Godden) who tries to flee before his re-education is complete, but ends up being burned alive in a bizarre game with petrol balls.
After the requisite camp group prisoner nude shower scene - with Red attempting to molest Chris - discussions between the overlords turn to Thatcher's new idea - a turkey shoot which will see some deviant prisoners allowed to run through the north Queensland scenery, pursued by him and his amused companions. If the deviants survive until sunset, they get to live, and if they don't &hellip;
Dodge and Griff and Rita and Paul and Chris race out into the jungle, and the rest of the story concentrates on their attempts to survive and strike back at their armed pursuers, as they flee through picturesque waterfalls and fields of sugar cane. &nbsp;
Tito and Alph make short work of Dodge, and though Griff manages to disarm Red and take his gun, he too succumbs - though he leaves Red in a fiendish Viet Cong style jungle trap that will leave its mark on Ritter.&nbsp;
That leaves the lesbian Jennifer in pursuit of sweet Rita, and after much splashing about in the tropical rivers, soon enough her sharp arrows are penetrating Rita's soft skin.
Chris and Paul at least have some success, taking out the bloated Mallory with a fire in a field of sugar cane, and severing the hands of the nasty Ritter.
The pair decide to head back to the camp, and liberate all the deviant prisoners. Thatcher is now in deep trouble, as Paul and Chris send their mini-'dozer crashing through the electrified prison fences. The camp goes on red alert, and jet fighters take to the air to bomb the camp and its deviant prisoners back to the stone age.
The camp becomes the site of a sub-Bondian war between guards and prisoners, with much shooting and many explosions. Chris uses an arrow to give Jennifer an explosive farewell and Thatcher loses his head, and soon enough the deviants will surge out into the world, as an end title sagely notes H. G. Wells' remark, Revolution begins with the misfits ...

          Some time in the future at Re-ed Camp 47 (some synopses put the year at 1995, but the film cannily avoids mentioning a date).
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          A trio of new arrivals are making their way to the camp by prison van. Paul (Steve Railsback) was a radical deviant caught red-handed broadcasting his deviant revolutionary thoughts to the world, while Chris (Olivia Hussey) foolishly attempted to intervene when the police were arresting another deviant in a jewellery store. And the third deviant, Rita, (Lynda Stoner) was said to be a whore, though she defiantly tells the other two she wasn't 
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          When they arrive at the camp, they're greeted by the whip-cracking, evil guard Red (Gus Mercurio) and soon enough they're meeting the camp commander Thatcher (Michael Craig), a smooth, suavely cold, thoroughly nasty chess-playing ruler, who shows the newcomers how the camp is run by having the vicious, bald-headed Ritter (Roger Ward) punch and kick deviant Melinda (Oriana Panozzo) into blood-saturated unconsciousness.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Thatcher has a couple of companions helping run the show. There's the visiting Secretary, Mallory, (Noel Ferrier), a fat, cigar-smoking cad who can't wait to get his hands on sweet Chris; the horse-riding and arrow-shooting sinister lesbian Jennifer (Carmen Duncan); and the suavely creepy villain Tito (Michael Petrovitch), who likes to hang around with a toe-chomping wolfman freak Alph (Steve Rackman), whom he found at a circus.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          On the other side, there's a bespectacled, hapless loser Dodge (John Ley) and a tall desperate deviant who wants to kill Thatcher and escape, Griff (Bill Young), and a wannabee escapee, Andy (John Godden) who tries to flee before his re-education is complete, but ends up being burned alive in a bizarre game with petrol balls.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          After the requisite camp group prisoner nude shower scene - with Red attempting to molest Chris - discussions between the overlords turn to Thatcher's new idea - a turkey shoot which will see some deviant prisoners allowed to run through the north Queensland scenery, pursued by him and his amused companions. If the deviants survive until sunset, they get to live, and if they don't 
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Dodge and Griff and Rita and Paul and Chris race out into the jungle, and the rest of the story concentrates on their attempts to survive and strike back at their armed pursuers, as they flee through picturesque waterfalls and fields of sugar cane.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Tito and Alph make short work of Dodge, and though Griff manages to disarm Red and take his gun, he too succumbs - though he leaves Red in a fiendish Viet Cong style jungle trap that will leave its mark on Ritter.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          That leaves the lesbian Jennifer in pursuit of sweet Rita, and after much splashing about in the tropical rivers, soon enough her sharp arrows are penetrating Rita's soft skin.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          Chris and Paul at least have some success, taking out the bloated Mallory with a fire in a field of sugar cane, and severing the hands of the nasty Ritter.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          The pair decide to head back to the camp, and liberate all the deviant prisoners. Thatcher is now in deep trouble, as Paul and Chris send their mini-'dozer crashing through the electrified prison fences. The camp goes on red alert, and jet fighters take to the air to bomb the camp and its deviant prisoners back to the stone age.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span>
          The camp becomes the site of a sub-Bondian war between guards and prisoners, with much shooting and many explosions. Chris uses an arrow to give Jennifer an explosive farewell and Thatcher loses his head, and soon enough the deviants will surge out into the world, as an end title sagely notes H. G. Wells' remark,
          <em>
           Revolution begins with the misfits

              The film did do a bit of theatrical business in England, though again most business was done on tape. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith hints in his DVD interview that the film did right by its investors, but stops short of saying it made its money back. It has, however, subsequently enjoyed a good life life as a cult item, first on VHS and subsequently on DVD, boosted by the support of Quentin Tarantino and Ozploitation devotees.

             $opinionDom = $('&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The film didn\'t trouble many mainstream reviewers, as it didn\'t stay long in hardtops, and most broadsheet reviewers didn\'t bother with drive-in trash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it was much loved by the tabloids and became an overnight tabloid sensation, helped along by Lynda Stoner\'s animal welfare and TV soap connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latecomers to the scene might wonder what all the fuss was about. The film is now a nostalgia fest, remarkably tame, with the live action violence done in tongue in cheek style, without benefit of CGIs, and with the climax turning into a sub-Bondian shoot-out involving a few hokey F-111s and Mirage IIIs dressed into the action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real problems with the film, as director Brian Trenchard-Smith acknowledges, arise from a gutted budget and schedule, which show up most prominently in the terrible mix, without benefit of ADR to fix delivery or performance, and the cheap synth score by Brian May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The average hard core horror enthusiast would in later days find it quaint, but at the time ponce critics like Phillip Adams and David Stratton reeled away in a state of shock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whenever the film was mentioned, it was often in association with the ponce Phillip Adams walking out on the show and turning up on the front page of the tabloid &lt;em&gt;Truth&lt;/em&gt; in a blaze of righteous anger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A cynic might observe that Adams himself, in his short, fitful career as a producer, had produced a couple of bogan comedies full of vomit and chunder beer and crude dick jokes (&lt;a href="../../../movie/adventures-of-barry-mckenzie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="../../../movie/barry-mckenzie-holds-his-own"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barry McKenzie Holds His Own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and was hardly to be in the position to pose as a high and mighty judge, even if he had made a couple of somnolescent period films, including &lt;a href="../../../movie/getting-of-wisdom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Getting of Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;We of the Never Never&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even when the film turned up in its natural home - VHS - Adams continued to haunt it, as in this report in &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; on 2nd May 1983 by David Frith in his video guide:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roadshow is planning a release shortly for what is said to be one of the vilest horror films ever made - Turkey Shoot, an Australian film which shows among other things, Lynda Stoner being rather savagely mutilated by a crazed lesbian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the film which Phillip Adams, having walked out on a pre-selection screening for the Australian Film Institute, described as "without doubt one of the worse films I\'ve ever seen and also the most violent".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a further remark which recent events have robbed of some of their sting, Adams told that journal of wisdom and good taste, the Melbourne Truth: "Turkey Shoot makes Mad Max look like Bill Hayden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It attempts to be serious but - with people being cut in half with bulldozers, having their hands lopped off, and running amok with swords and spears - it becomes a violent farce." Sounds just like what the market wants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only a pompous, righteous ass like Adams could have deemed the film an attempt to be serious, but he had form - he\'d carried on in exactly the same way about &lt;a href="../../../movie/mad-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but amazingly, he reached a new low by featuring on the front page of low rent tabloid Melbourne &lt;em&gt;Truth&lt;/em&gt;, a newspaper which made &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt; look like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adams set the tone for all the tut tutting and clucking about a film that was just an average bit of exploitation, which suffered fatally from a substantial cut to budget and shooting time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It should go without saying that David Stratton dismissed the film in his 1990 &lt;em&gt;The Avocado Plantation&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;"merely a catalogue of sickening horrors":&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This variation on The Hounds of Zaroff, involving an island prison camp of the future, includes scenes in which: a mutant is sliced in half by a bulldozer; a man is shot full of arrows, then run over by a car; another man is shot in the groin; Olivia Hussey chops the hands off a man; a woman\'s body is found covered with lacerations, an arrow plunged into her mouth; a man is literally decapitated by bullets; a woman is stabbed in the face with an exploding arrow; and a woman is punched and kicked to death. All of this is lovingly shot, and seems to be an exercise solely designed for the sadists in the community. The actors involved (Michael Craig, Carmen Duncan, Noel Ferrier) should have been ashamed for appearing in such trash: some apparently were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The special effects are undeniably well done, and the film is certainly slick ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stratton, like Adams, has ongoing form in this area, and has had an unhealthy influence on the industry\'s &nbsp;potential for exploitation product - Geoffrey Wright threw a glass of red wine in his face after a disagreement over &lt;em&gt;Romper Stomper&lt;/em&gt;, and much later Stratton refused to line up to review the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Wolf Creek&lt;/em&gt; for his ABC movie show. But it\'s not just the words that matter, as Stratton noted for the record:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ginnane (producer Tony Ginnane) asserts that my review in the New York-based international show-business journal, Variety (20 April 1983), in which I described the film as a \'sadistic bloodbath\', lost him a sale to Malaysia when the censor there banned it, enclosing a cutting of the Variety review with his letter of rejection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That\'s bravery, standing between Ginnane and a sale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Geoff Mayer, later a Reader and Associate Professor at La Trobe University, Melbourne and Head of the School of Communication, Arts and Critical Enquiry at La Trobe, and the author of several books on film, was given the job of reviewing the film for specialist magazine &lt;em&gt;Cinema Papers&lt;/em&gt;, No. 42 March 1983, and sounded almost as remarkably solemn as Adams (this &lt;em&gt;senses of cinema&lt;/em&gt; re-print is also archived at &lt;em&gt;Pandora&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/103201/20090728-0108/archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/08/48/turkey-shoot.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the foyer of the East End Cinema, Melbourne, a group of teenage boys walked up to an enlarged copy of the Truth newspaper report of Phillip Adams\' walkout of Turkey Shoot (Brian Trenchard-Smith, 1983) at the Australian Film Awards pre-selection screenings in July 1982. One boy said, "That\'s good enough for me", and led the rest of the group into the cinema. Similarly, I felt that any film that upsets the delicate sensibilities of Mr Adams can\'t be all bad. However, my doubts about the film began to grow in the first few minutes, particularly after the sight of Red (Gus Mercurio) greeting the new inmates - Paul Anders (Steve Railsback), Rita Daniels (Lynda Stoner) and Chris Walters (Olivia Hussey) - at a detention camp. Red, with a leer, limp and whip, appeared to be straight out of Hitler - Beast of Berlin (Sam Newfield, 1939) and he, and Ritter (Roger Ward), set the tone for the rest of the film.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paul, Rita and Chris, who are victims of a totalitarian society, are subjected to continual harassment in the camp run by Charles Thatcher (Michael Craig). My disquiet with the proceedings accelerated as Ritter tortures a young girl by beating her repeatedly around the head. After beating another inmate, Dodge (John Ley) asks Ritter if he wants him to bury her and, when Ritter replies that the girl "ain\'t dead yet", Dodge says," I could do it anyway." This is quickly followed by Red\'s attack on Chris in the showers, which she combats by zipping up his fly whilst he is fully aroused, and Jennifer (Carmen Duncan) assembling a gun blindfolded while telling another guest of the camp. "It\'s less the size of one\'s gun that counts than the skill with which it is used."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point, I threw away my pen and notes, reached for the potato chips and tried to enter the spirit of the film with the rest of the audience. However, the violence in the first part is mild compared with the atrocities of the "turkey shoot": hands are sliced off, toes are bitten off, skulls are split, bodies are dismembered and disembowelled, etc. After each episode of escalating, graphic violence, the boy who was impressed by the report of Adams\' walkout, told his mates, "I love it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although the film never specifies the time or place, a publicity hand-out reports that the film is set in 1995 in an unidentified society ("Soviet totalitarianism with a capitalist veneer", according to director Brian Trenchard-Smith) where the "deviates" - that is, those opposed to the ruling government - are brought to a "correction" camp. Guests at the camp, including Mallory (Noel Ferrier) and Jennifer, are invited to participate in a turkey shoot, whereby selected inmates are released into the surrounding jungle and are promised, falsely, that, if they evade capture until sundown, they will be set free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a reworking of an often-used plot which appeared as long ago as 1932 in The Most Dangerous Game (Irving Pichel and Ernest B. Schoedsack). In this film, Bob Rainsford (Joel McCrea) and Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray) provide the sport for a mad Russian count on his island. It subsequently was re-worked in 1945 as A Game of Death (Robert Wise), in 1956 as Run for the Sun (Roy Boulting) and then on television in Gilligan\'s Island and Get Smart. An essential ingredient in most of the earlier versions, including the television series, was the time element, the supposed sanctuary of sundown. However, there is little or no tension in Jon George and Neill Hick\'s script for Turkey Shoot. Instead of a steady build-up and accompanying suspense by means of basic techniques such as cross-cutting from the quarry to the hunter, the film cross-cuts during the hunt from one scene of graphic violence to another. The build-up becomes unimportant and is replaced by execution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the film\'s surface of sex and violence marks its relatively contemporary context, Turkey Shoot has the basic structure of a 19th Century melodrama. For example, characters are stripped of any complexity and are represented by one, or at best two, attributes or traits. Thus, Paul is victim and saviour, Chris and Rita are victims, Thatcher is a sadist, Jennifer is a lesbian sadist and so on. They all occupy a purely fictional position in the narrative as they project the film\'s simplistic notion of a strict polarization between good and evil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plot is equally predictable: regular emotional and physical climaxes punctuate the narrative, often for no other purpose than to retain audience attention in a crude fashion, and to deflect scrutiny of the simple characterizations and repetitive nature of the plot. The only real modification of the 19th Century formula is that the male victims share equal \'torment time\' with the females, whereas in traditional melodrama the threat to the heroine is elaborated compared with that to the hero, who was usually subjected to sudden shocks. The narrative closure to Turkey Shoot is equally predictable and retains the virtue is rewarded and vice is punished convention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How then does the film retain audience interest? Aside from spectacle, which is a traditional attribute of melodrama, Turkey Shoot relies almost completely on mutilation, torture and killing. The graphic nature of the violence escalates from an early scene in which blood is pouring out of a victim\'s mouth to exploding bodies in the last part. The effect of this is to distance the audience so that, instead of the usual involvement with the plight of the hero or heroine, the interest of the audience is relegated to anticipation of the next atrocity. In other words, interest is focused, not so much on who survives the turkey shoot, but on the repulsion and fascination with the methods used to eliminate the villains and most of their victims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two other issues require brief consideration. First, the film has been described, by Lynda Stoner in a radio interview, as a "black comedy". If one characterizes black comedy as the "acceptance of the unacceptable", then this may be a plausible description, but it would ignore the powerful exploitation which the film proudly has in the foreground at every possible opportunity. Second, Turkey Shoot\'s "M" rating raises the problem of inconsistency in the recent censorship ratings. As one who is opposed to all censorship, except as protection for those underage, I don\'t wish to advocate a more repressive attitude. However, the full-frontal nudity, the language and especially the graphic violence in the film seem to question the validity of the "R" rating given to several recent films.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it came to Murray\'s 1995 &lt;em&gt;Australian Cinema&lt;/em&gt;, Greg Kerr was equally damning - he too insists that a film which features a Thatcher in charge of its camp is unintentionally comical, as opposed to being intentionally silly, and imagines the camp is Communist - when it might just as well have been Thatcher\'s right-wing Britain, or on an equal opportunity basis, somewhere in Tito-land:&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turkey Shoot purports to represent a nightmarish vision of 1995, a time when henchmen from a dictatorship are rounding up dissidents and malcontents into re-education camps. The $3.2 million splatter fantasy centres on \'Re-Ed Camp 47\', a type of tropical Gulag where commanders espouse hard-core Communist ideology and think up novel ways to slaughter their captives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;To ease the boredom, the captors release five troublesome \'deviates into the wilds and set out to hunt them to death. Hereafter, the film preoccupies itself with a series of unintentionally comical cat-and-mouse chases, and a blood-letting spree that is gratuitous to the point of being absurd. It borrows the plot-line of The Most Dangerous Game (Ernest B. Schoedsack, Irving Pichel, also known as The Hounds of Zaroff UK), a 1932 film about a count who hunts criminals on a remote island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;In translation, Turkey Shoot botches the hunter-versus-hunted scenario with an over-emphasis on violence, appalling acting and a plot that is no more advanced than a boys\' adventure comic. The prison brass go out on the hunt with all sorts of gadgets, including machine-guns and arrows that explode. One of the pursuers even has an ape-man called Alf (sic) to help dispose of victims. The story abounds with sinister intention, but with the way the hunters bungle around, they really aren\'t much nastier than the German POW guards in Hogan\'s Heroes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The villains end up easy picking for the \'heroes\' of the show, Paul Anders (Steve Railsback) and Chris Walters (Olivia Hussey), who go back to main camp and inspire the other captives to insurrection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turkey Shoot never stands a chance of being taken seriously in either the choice or treatment of its subject matter. The notion of re-education camps in western democracies (the pawns of the dictatorship have either Australian or American accents) is about as likely as Elvis Presley turning up on Mars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apart from a far-fetched storyline, the film is riddled with sight misrepresentation and flaws in plot, editing and continuity. In once scene, Gus Mercurio, who plays a gammy-legged prison guard, forgets he has a limp. In another, the single-shot rifle of Charles Thatcher (Michael Craig) mysteriously acquires a semi-automatic capacity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The dialogue is hollow, clich&eacute;d and laced with cheap sexual innuendo that would not be out of place in a garage porno flick. Brian May\'s music creates a foreboding mood during the opening credits, though later his garbled synthesiser arrangements are snuffed out by torrents of gunfire and screaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the making of the film in northern Queensland, director Brian Trenchard-Smith was quoted as saying, \'The name of the game is blood and guts.\' The finished product excels in nothing more, but even its gory special effects are messy and Monty Pythonesque in flavour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turkey Shoot is so incompetent and over-indulged that one cannot be altogether sure that its creators did not have some tongue-in-cheek intentions. Unfortunately, though, the film is laughable for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If there was any justice in the world, Kerr would have, in due course, ended up in an Arizona prison - or maybe one in Texas or even in Guantanamo - talking about the way re-education camps are as unlikely in the west as Elvis Presley turning up on Mars.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whatever, it was a long time between drinks for Brian Trenchard-Smith in his search for a kind word about the film, so no wonder he fell out of his chair in excitement when Quentin Tarantino delivered the goods:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some critics considered my career was over after Turkey Shoot. Luckily my next film was BMX Bandits with Nicole Kidman. Both audiences and critics seemed to click with that one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I certainly was not starting every producer/executive interview with: "Hi, I made Turkey Shoot!" &nbsp;(Escape 2000 in the US). So, at the premiere of HBO\'s Marilyn and Norma Jean, I met Quentin Tarantino. I gave my name and he said: "You made Turkey Shoot!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;He went on to list all the things he liked about the film, including: &nbsp;" I loved that scene where Roger Ward beats that girl (the wonderful Oriana Panozzo) to death on the parade ground while she tries to recite the dissidents\' mea culpa." &nbsp;Which he then recited verbatim! At the Sydney premiere of Kill Bill Volume 1, Quentin dedicated the screening to Turkey Shoot, much to the shock of the assembled glitterati. As he put it later: "I like to stick a lighted weed up the ass of the snob." (&lt;a href="http://www.acmi.net.au/ozploitation_essay_briantrenchardsmith.htm"&gt;ACMI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tarantino repeated the praise for the cameras in Mark Hartley\'s documentary about Ozploitation cinema, &lt;em&gt;Not Quite Hollywood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trenchard-Smith, in his interviews, is often overt about his leftist inclincations and his hostility towards politicians like Magaret Thatcher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His fantasy script for ACMI, originally published &lt;a href="http://www.acmi.net.au/ozploitation_essay_briantrenchardsmith.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests his uneasy relationship with the ponces and snobs like Adams and Stratton and Kerr:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;INT. &nbsp;LONDON UNDERGROUND PLATFORM DAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;England 1983. &nbsp;Commuters stand in silent groups awaiting the next rattling arrival on the Piccadilly Line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work, consume, be silent, die - is etched on the faces of many. The Thatcher Years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only two men are having a conversation; one, a young movie geek, the other, a national newspaper film critic (although in fact he sees himself as a Cinema Critic).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;MOVIE GEEK: Glad the mail strike is over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;CRITIC: So am I.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;He is about to launch into a haughty rant about militant trade unions when his companion steps away to look at a large movie poster on the curved wall opposite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the poster - in the style of Hunter With His Kill trophy photography - a tall muscular bald headed man carrying an MI6 stands with his foot on the corpse of a beautiful young woman while other hunters stand behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;MOVIE GEEK: That\'s the bloke from Mad Max. Roger Ward. I want to see that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The gleaming dome combines with the curvature of the paramilitary hunter\'s moustache to conjure a diabolically evil face, a leer colouring the edges of cruel resolve. If that was the brief to the poster artist at press kit time, he succeeded admirably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emblazoned below is the title TURKEY SHOOT, with the admonitory ad line: NO FILM FOR CHICKENS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;CRITIC: They haven\'t press shown it, so it\'s obviously trash. If I bother to catch it, I might give it a paragraph. Looks vile and sadistic to me. I just don\'t understand people\'s taste these days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vile, sadistic, and trashy, with the added bonus of Roger Ward - sounds pretty good to the movie geek.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;INTERIOR. FILM CRITIC\'S OFFICE DAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the end of the mail strike - small packages have not been delivered for 10 days - there is a mountain of correspondence on the Critic\'s desk. Inside the final package is a small slender box about six inches long. The Critic does not glance at the covering letter. He wants to get straight to The Gift. He opens the box and immediately his nostrils are assaulted by a foul, pungent aroma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;There, on a bed of cotton wool, is a rotting turkey\'s foot. The luckless appendage had set out on its adventure through the postal system some 11 days before and is now at the height of &nbsp;putrefaction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Critic grabs the covering letter. It is an invitation to the Press screening of Turkey Shoot, mailed on the day before the mail strike, arriving now on the day of the screening. If he leaves immediately, he will get there just in time. This insult to his dignity and stature must be addressed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;CUT TO: &nbsp; FORTIES-STYLE LAP DISSOLVE MONTAGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Critic watches the movie, scribbling furiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nearby, other nasally-affronted critics note each sensational act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Superimposed titles of some of their phrases glide past camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like: &nbsp;"cut in half by a bulldozer"&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "riddled with arrows!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And: &nbsp; "lesbian rape!" Ooh, now you\'re talking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Various angles of London Underground commuters reading newspapers intently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Close up of the Turkey Shoot reviews excoriating the film, some quoting the fulminations of Australian commentator and film producer Philip Adams. The words "senselessly violent" lift off the page, moving towards camera. As it does so, the word "senselessly" fades out, leaving only the word "violent" to dominate the frame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each commuting reader takes this in, along with detailed examples of at least six depraved-fun sequences he and his mates would love to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;EXTERIOR. WARNER WEST END THEATRE 2 NIGHT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Critic is crossing Leicester Square. A light dusting of snow is falling. He sees a line around the block of the adjacent Theatre.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is the line for the movie Turkey Shoot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, to Brian Trenchard-Smith\'s relief, they turned out London to see the film, even in a blizzard, after an effective &nbsp;trash marketing campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even now the film continues to beguile reviewers in the online world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some are astonished to discover that the film does indeed contain execrable acting, and a woefully executed script, but these days the violence which shocked and outraged in the 1980s merely seems quaint, especially as it was done without benefit of CGIs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Quentin Tarantino has spoken and so attention is paid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is for example a lengthy disquisition on the film on &lt;em&gt;B-Notes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jabootu.com/acolytes/bnotes/escape2k.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which offered this bottom line:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a dystopian future, the warden of a re-education camp chooses some of his prisoners to be hunted for sport. &nbsp;Somewhat gory, clumsy attempt at merging "The Most Dangerous Game" with a pale copy of Orwellian concerns. Moves at a good clip once it gets started, but too many scenes are unapologetically incredible because they openly violate fundamental story telling elements like continuity and such. Goofy props. Not recommended, but if you must watch it, try it with the sound off. &nbsp;And don\'t do drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The review has a handy list of similar movies using the same theme of hunting humans though it was presumably written too early to note that The Hunger Games had also stolen Turkey Shoot\'s thunder. There\'s also a fun guide to the many continuity and production errors that litter the show, the result of a reduced budget and too much haste in the reduced schedule.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Kenneth Muir offered this conclusion - the full review was available online at time of writing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com.au/2011/04/cult-movie-review-turkey-shoot-1981.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again and again, Turkey Shoot goes boldly for broke, makes distinctly odd creative choices, and proves itself absolutely entertaining in a very lowbrow kind of way. &nbsp;The film really falters in that last act, however. &nbsp;There is a scene of impressive, all-out warfare at the camp, with explosions popping every minute. &nbsp;But then the planes are scrambled, and you expect the film to have a dark ending, in keeping with its premise and execution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But nope, the planes depart, the prisoners are freed, and Railsback and Hussey share a sentimental hug, and then a climactic freeze frame, to the above-mentioned Wells quote. &nbsp;How long, after that valedictory freeze-frame, one wonders, will the rebels survive? &nbsp;It\'s a cheesy and dishonest ending to an otherwise very droll, very wicked, very bloody exploitation piece.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for the first half of the film, Turkey Shoot doesn\'t hit a single wrong, or tasteful note. &nbsp;The dialogue is sharp, and occasionally laugh-out loud funny. For instance, one Nazi villain observes that watching the Camp surveillance monitors "beats the hell out of network television."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another comment by these happy fascists also bears repeating: "Excess is what makes life worth living."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I\'d amend that quote only slightly in assessing Turkey Shoot. "Excessive movies also (and only sometimes) make life worth living."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Grindhouse\'s&lt;/em&gt; review was more ambivalent - its full review is &lt;a href="http://dailygrindhouse.com/reviews/turkey-shoot-1982/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it ended this way:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trenchard-Smith obviously takes great joy in these sorts of genre mash-ups, and while I would have loved to see what he could have done with his original plan, he keeps the action moving and has the good sense to let his performers have a bit of slack for appropriate scenery chewing. I do wish we had gotten a bit more insight into the futuristic society itself - the dialogue we get only hints at exactly how screwed up the outside world has become - but there\'s blood to be shed and trees to be demolished, and only ninety minutes to get it all done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I do want to mention the odd musical score by Brian May (not *that* Brian May) which attempts for some futuristic sounding synth, but ends up sounding hopelessly dated and terrible. When it wasn\'t reminding me of the soundtrack to the Canadian classic Strange Brew (1983), it was distractingly horrid."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Excess is what makes life worth living", states one of the antagonists in Turkey Shoot, and it\'s also what makes even Brian Trenchard-Smith\'s lesser films worthwhile. While not the lost classic that its memorable appearance in Not Quite Hollywood would imply, it still features plenty of slam-bang action and a lot of pulp fun for fans of exploitation and oddness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jason Alley handed out four stars and concluded:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turkey Shoot is an out-and-out blast from start to finish. While obviously made on a strict budget, Trenchard-Smith\'s bleak depiction of the future is captivating, the heroes are cool, and the villains are awesomely wicked. It\'s the kind of movie where part of the enjoyment lies in knowing that the villains are going to eventually get what\'s coming to them and then delighting in their gruesome comeuppances. The violence is effective, the action scenes exciting and nearly non-stop, and the gore effects wonderfully done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you love "deadly game" movies like those listed above, especially The Running Man (which this film resembles the most, not only in plot but in entertainment value and quality/cheese ratio), then you owe it to yourself to see this movie because it influenced almost all of them. And just because it\'s loads of nasty fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The full review is &lt;a href="http://letterboxd.com/jason_alley/film/turkey-shoot/2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many many more reviews available online - this was just a sample of the ones that had got to the top of Google rankings at time of writing. Googling &lt;em&gt;"Turkey Shoot review"&lt;/em&gt; for as long as Google is working will produce a plethora of hits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the real test is &lt;em&gt;Cinephilia&lt;/em&gt;, a site which is always inclined to be severe about Australian product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Say what? David Michael Brown hands out four stars and lavish praise:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listening to the cast and crew today, many seem embarrassed at this blot on their r&eacute;sum&eacute;. This is a shame as on its own merits, Turkey Shoot is great fun. Lifeforce and The Stunt Man star Steven Railsback is adequate in the action hero roles and the girls, Olivia Hussey and Lynda Stoner, are merely there to look good in underwritten roles. More joy is to be had in the over played villains on display. Michael Craig is charismatic as the evil Thatcher, Roger Ward is immense as the sadistic guard, Ritter, and the demented group of hunters who pursue our heroes attack their roles with relish. A special mention must be made of Alf (sic), a disturbing, toe-chewing creature who growls his way through the movie in a startling manner with no real explanation for his existence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the UK Turkey Shoot was renamed to tie in with a nation\'s hatred of the Conservative government helmed by its most infamous Prime Minister. With its new moniker, Blood Camp Thatcher, the film, ironically, was shorn by the censors of its numerous scenes of nudity and violence but became a cult hit nevertheless thanks to its relentless pace and non-stop action. Entertaining in the extreme, it\'s a must see for any exploitation connoisseur. Australian trash at it\'s finest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let\'s forgive the errant apostrophe in that last sentence - trash film needs trash grammar - and note the rest of the review is equally enthusiastic, and in its full form is available &lt;a href="http://www.cinephilia.net.au/show_movie.php?movieid=2213"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And so eventually after many travails and man hunts, Trenchard-Smith can enter the house of trash redeemed, and be justified and exalted in the eyes of Ozmovie cultists. They\'re still talking about the show after all those years have flown ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'); //string of whole p

              The Umbrella release in Australia was perfectly respectable, as was the Anchor Bay edition in the United States, with the restoration good, colours strong, and the usual signs of age, grain, fading blacks, dirt and sparkle kept under control. Director Brian Trenchard Smith himself, in interviews and on DVD, said he approved of the release.

              Hartley, featured Lynda Stoner, Michael Craig and Roger Ward and the result is lively and amusing, as Stoner writhes in agony at having appeared in the show, Craig delivers a pragmatic judgement on some of the follies he observed (like Stoner refusing to degut fish and Steve Railsback doing method routines), and Ward is cheerfully carefree in admitting he was there for the money. (Stoner also says the interview had therapeutic value, saying with a laugh,
              <em>
               "thanks for the cleansing process, I feel Turkey Shoot is now exorcised from me"

              The other side of the production follies is covered in an undated interview by Mark Hartley with director Brian Trenchard-Smith. It's called
              <em>
               A Good Soldier
              </em>
              in the DVD menu, but not in the actual 9'48" interview, and as usual Trenchard-Smith makes a beguiling case for his side.

            <p>
             <span>
              The title's taken from Trenchard-Smith's notion that he was a good soldier to have stayed on the shoot and finished the job, and not walked away after schedule and budget cuts, and it's hard to argue with that.

              The interview isn't dated and surprisingly is in 4:3. Trenchard-Smith is informative enough, confronted by memories of a turkey by name and by nature, but he could have talked a lot more about the agonies of the shoot. But then it was a long time ago and dealing with Lynda Stoner's refusal to degut fish for camera must have, by then, felt like a forgotten nightmare.

              There was talk of the film turning up on Blu-ray, but even if it did, some viewers would wonder about the point of the exercise. The DVD version looks good enough - too good in fact. This is the sort of show once seen in drive-ins, with car lights washing out the scratched battered images, as the film clattered through the gates, at the points where projectionists had snipped out frames of the generously endowed substitute posing as Olivia Hussey's breasts, while in the cars teenage Australians either furtively groped partners or munched burgers and popcorn in a pimple frenzy.

              A former instructor as well as a successful lecturer, Hicks concentrates his efforts of late on consulting with the studios, particularly in the analysis and rewriting of scripts. Over the years, he has successfully written or rewritten work for productions in Australia, Scandinavia, India and Hong Kong, among other places. When I asked him how others might duplicate these feats, he laughed and wondered aloud if many writers would even want to go that route.

              This is not to imply that the experiences weren't good for Neill, but, he stressed, these opportunities were a result of luck and networking, and nothing he'd deliberately sought. "There are a variety of problems that an aspiring screenwriter would come up against," Neill explains, citing the scarcity of centralized means to connect with outfits that need the work. He also mentioned the employment requirements sometimes attached to the funding of international productions and, of course, the cultural differences few American writers would likely anticipate.

              Jon George is a native East Texan who very early on discovered in himself a deep affection for the Southwestern desert. Because of this, he has spent the past twenty-five years in Southern California and Nevada. He now lives in La Quinta, real desert, with his wife and two dogs. He took his Bachelor's degree in Texas, his Masters on the East Coast, and did his doctoral studies at the University of California at Berkeley. Having taught literature for some years at several universities, he decided he would make some himself. However, this feeling soon passed, and for the next twenty-odd years he has made his living writing in film and television, an experience which has only heightened his delight in a well-told story. Among his work are Harlequin, Escape 2000, Final Terror, Odds &amp; Others, The Perpetrator and Don't Talk To Strangers. He has written other works, produced but unreleased, and had others sold but unproduced. That is the way of the business. He has also taught screenwriting seminars and creative writing classes at area colleges and universities and feels good about having helped a number of private clients get a start in the business.

              A: I developed the script closely with Neill Hicks and Jon George, so the political satire was there from the beginning. The original script was sort of like 'I Was A Fugitive From A Chain Gang' meets 'The Most Dangerous Game, with 70 pages of 'Chain Gang' and 'Most Dangerous Game' lasted about 35 pages. I didn't think that was good balance. Also it was set in the depression era Deep South. We had tax based financing in place on condition that it was supposed to be set in Australia. So I suggested we set it in the future, and make it more universal. We wanted to make a tongue in cheek but gutsy action movie with subtext about corporate fascism at the beginning of the Reagan era.

             When the budget shrank, the first fifteen pages were simply torn out and many other amendments were made (accoding to Stratton in

              Status in prep: A serious budget shortfall due to the Government changing its previous position on tax rebates for investors was causing the producers and I considerable difficulty as the shoot date approached.

              Cut were the first 15 pages set in a corporate fascist city of the future where the heroes are captured in a series of chases. Next, a 4 page helicopter chase had to go, along with its pilot character to be played by the late actor and TV personality Graham Kennedy, because terms could not be agreed. So I had to quickly distribute his function to other characters in the story. This all brought the script down by a quarter of its length. I made stuff up every shooting day to fill out the contracted running time. But all the action I came up with had to be achieved without incurring loadings for any stuntman. The prison camp had been built for 500 extras, but now we could only afford 75 on our biggest day. A range of challenges. How could I ensure an audience? I decided to increase the level of blood and black hearted laughs into a sort of Lucio Fulci high camp splatter movie. Blood is cheap.

Well it was a film, I didn't care what the films were, I didn't care about the content, it was in the 70s and the 80s, it was done in '81, and in those days we were just going from one film to the other  and I wasn't looking for art, I was looking for money in the bank.

             A card in the interview advises that the proposed $3.2 million budget lost a 700k investment, two weeks before the film was due to begin shooting, and so the schedule was slashed from 44 days to 30 days.

All the cast deserve praise. But Michael Craig is wonderful as the smoothly sadistic Thatcher. I love his delivery of the Re-Education Camp's mantra: "Freedom is Obedience. Obedience is Work. Work is Life." (That's the future that awaits America, if they don't come to their senses in November and put A Brain into the White House.)

              The scene where I beat the girl to death  I did, well, I did like that scene looking at it myself as an actor, but if I was not the actor playing that part and I saw another actor doing it, I probably would have felt angry towards that actor for what he did and the way he played it, like I played it so arrogantly and all that, but I was quite pleased as an actor to see that performance and the girl was very good too, Oriana Panozzo her name was, lovely little thing, but er I bruised her pretty badly, she was bruised up not from where I hit her, but I grabbed her pretty tightly around the shirt, and she didn't complain, you know, and I was quite pleased with the way the scene turned out, yeah. It is violent, although when I was kicking - when she was out of frame - I was only kicking a sandbag. Yeah, I liked that scene  I played a lot of those types although I went against type in Mad Max, I was the nice guy for a change but I had played a lot of sadistic rough guys, which I enjoyed playing ...

              One of my more hilarious memories was the day we cut Steve Rackman in half at the trouser belt level with a bulldozer. You know, the way people do. I wanted a shot of his bottom half, kneeling trapped against a tree, wriggling beneath the dozer blade. (True, I am a sick puppy.) We had the pants suspended by monofilament, but we were running very short on prosthetics. We had eaten sausages and steak for lunch; there were uncooked leftovers and lots of ketchup. Everyone pitched in to fill the Travelling Pants with a convincing set of innards, and squirt individually designed trails of tomato sauce. The things we do for our Art. (ACMI,

             Rackman began as an amateur wrestler in England, and arrived in Australia in 1970, to take on the World Championship Wrestling circuit, which saw matches staged at the Hordern Pavilion on a Friday night, Channel Nine's studio on a Saturday morning, and at the Festival Hall in Melbourne on a Sunday night. The going rate in 1983 for a name wrestler was a thousand dollars a week. (See more on Rackman on groupies, sexual fulfilment, injuries, and over-excited patrons at the

             It says something about this particular circus that it would mingle a Zefirelli star with a US method actor with a wrestler with a TV soapie animal activist with a traditional UK actor. That mingling would lead to other anecdotes:

              Of course, the film's most famous legend has Hoffman, in an earnest attempt to inhabit his character, coming onto the set one morning, weak and bleary-eyed from staying out all night. Olivier, so the story goes, took one look at him and uttered the immortal line, "Why doesn't he just try acting?" The anecdote has been told and retold in so many different versions that it's become impossible to pin down now. Everyone from Bob Evans to Conrad Hall to Hawk Koch would claim to have been there when it was said, and each of their accounts were different. John [Schlesinger] himself would tell the story in a variety of ways, sometimes insisting Olivier made the remark to him in the cutting room, other times that he spoke it directly to Dustin. Hoffman, for his part, says Olivier uttered the line as a laugh between the two of them, when Dustin staggered onto the set after a night of partying, weakly joking to "his lordship" that it had been his way of preparing for the part.

             Michael Craig made his mental note about Railsback's method acting some five years after Olivier. Perhaps the story was running through his mind, as yet another professional English actor was confronted by yet another American actor torturing himself for no discernible reason.

             It turned out to be more than a rumour. Hemmings - a notoriously inept director himself, who played the role of director much better than he performed it - was in charge of a second unit that filmed a lot of the running and jumping action, in a bid to bring the shoot in on schedule.

He knew that a Completion Guarantor had me waiting in the wings to take over an earlier film Hemmings was directing if he continued to remain behind schedule. He was having an on again off again affair with a member of the cast. When he made fun of me in front of my wife and new born son once in the production office, I poured beer on his head.

              Needless to say, critics did not share my sense of humour. And to be honest, the film is far from perfect. The score is not my favourite, but a generation later sees it as part of the fun. But Turkey Shoot allowed me to push some genre clichs to their outrageous extreme. All film makers find themselves in situations where the playing field tips and the goal posts shift. You just have to develop some elasticity and go with the flow, while still trying to preserve the core of your original vision. But ultimately, a good movie in these circumstances is a saleable movie.

              Turkey Shoot broke box office records in some Australian drive-ins, scored a US theatrical release (albeit with censor cuts), and ultimately video audiences across the globe discovered it as a guilty pleasure. I recall all 130 RAAF personnel playing Afrika Corps soldiers in my Sahara remake put their hands up when asked if they had seen Turkey Shoot! As a result of its cult following, Umbrella put out a re-mastered uncensored DVD which looks great. If you are curious, the extras provide some insight into a director hanging onto a runaway train. Some critics considered my career was over after Turkey Shoot. Luckily my next film was BMX Bandits with Nicole Kidman. Both audiences and critics seemed to click with that one.

              I think this may have affected the attitude of the British public going to see it. They wanted to see a prison camp run by somebody called Thatcher. It went out in England with also a clever way of getting publicity was to send turkeys' feet to, in a little box with an invitation to the press preview, to all the London film critics.

             The film now enjoys such an underground reputation that there have been attempts to do a re-make by producer Antony Ginnane (though Mark Hartley's unfortunate re-make of
             <em>

             But while the film has enjoyed a strong revival as a piece of Ozploitation, celebrated by Quentin Tarantino and Mark Hartley, its contribution to the sexploitation cinema of prison camps is modest and circumspect, as director Brian Trenchard-Smith noted in his DVD interview:

             So generations of cultists who think they've seen Olivia Hussey's breasts on screen have been misled into watching those of an anonymous Cairns' woman, or so the director says, which is in its way in perfect keeping with the traditions of exploitation.

             The film's real contribution to the Ozploitaiton tradition was the gratuitously sadistic violence - an eye-gouging here, a decapitation there, hands chopped off, several deaths by burning, including a fire in a field of sugar cane and so on:
