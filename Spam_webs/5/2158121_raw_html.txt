At just one pound and 0.29 inch thick, the tablet is light enough to hold with just your fingertips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Box\nThe only notable thing about the iPad Air box is that it's smaller than any full-size iPad box that's come before it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air side view\nAs you can see, the lock switch and volume buttons are still on the side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Back\nAside from the \"space gray\" aluminum, there's nothing remarkable about the back of the iPad Air. You can see the iSight camera in the upper left corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air's iSight Camera\nThis is pretty much the same camera you'll find on the previous iPad and on the iPhone 5C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Top Edge\nThe top edge features the 3.5mm audio jack, microphone opening and the power/sleep button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Speakers and Lighting Port\nAnother look at that very thin edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Bottom Edge \nYou'll find the speakers and Lightning port on the bottom edge of the iPad Air. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air in Smart Case\nThe new iPad Air fits snugly into the leather Smart Case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Bottom View\nAnother look at the bottom of the iPad Air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air Slims Down\nCompared with previous iPads, the iPad Air (left) is also considerably thinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Smaller iPad\nThe iPad Air is considerably smaller than the iPad 4 (bottom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPads of All Shapes and Sizes\nAt the bottom is an iPad 4. In the middle is the much smaller iPad Air (with the same size screen). On top is the iPad Mini (Gen 1). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air is Thin and Light\nIt's fun to hold it like this, but not particularly useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air in New Smart Case\nIf you've seen iOS 7 before, then the home screen is quite familiar. Even if you haven't, it still looks just like an iPad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew iPad Air Smart Case\nThe new Smart Case is leather and fits the iPad Air perfectly. It's easy to put on and a bit tricky to take off. It also doubles as a stand. It lists for $79.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Case Rear View\nThe case features an opening for the camera, speakers and Lightning port. Other buttons are covered, but still entirely usable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air in Smart Case Beside Smart Cover\nDon't want to cover the iPad Air's shiny back? Try the smart cover. It costs $39.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPad Air With iPad Mini on Top\nThey share many of the same specs, but the iPad Air is considerably larger than the iPad Mini.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many things Apple\u2019s iPad Air is not. It\u2019s not the cheapest tablet you can buy. It\u2019s not the lightest. It doesn't have the highest resolution screen. Yet, on balance, it\u2019s still the best consumer tablet on the market. Here\u2019s why.\nA Stellar Design\nLet\u2019s start with what is most noticeably different about this fifth-generation iPad: At 0.29 inches, the iPad Air is the thinnest full-size iPad Apple has ever made. It\u2019s also the exact same thickness as the new iPad Mini Retina. In fact, if you\u2019ve ever seen an iPad Mini, you know exactly what the iPad Air looks like: it\u2019s essentially a larger clone.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never had the pleasure of touching or seeing an iPad Mini in person, the iPad Air is most easily described as an elegant slab. The back is almost entirely brushed aluminum (it comes in standard aluminum color and \"space gray\" \u2014 my test unit is the latter). The LTE model has a plastic bar at the top for the antenna, and there\u2019s a 5-megapixel iSight camera on the back. \nThe lightly tapered edges house metal volume buttons and a rotation-lock/mute switch on one side, a power/sleep button and 3.5mm audio jack on top, and the Lighting port and speakers on the bottom edge.\nThe front is very familiar-looking, a black or white face with a 9.7-inch screen, a 1.2MP (720p) FaceTime camera and the very familiar Home bottom near the bottom. Apple didn't include its new Touch ID technology in the iPad Air. When I asked them about this, their explanation was vague, but equated to, \u201cWe just added it in the iPhone 5s, so...\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m so used to unlocking my 5S with my thumb that I truly missed this feature on the iPad Air.\nSee also: The 25 Best Free iPad Apps\nThere is another stark difference between the fourth-generation iPad (and really all other previous iPad editions) and this one: the iPad Air is almost three-quarters-of-an-inch narrower. That\u2019s right, Apple managed to make the iPad Air thinner and smaller while maintaining the exact same screen size. The end result is a one-pound tablet that's incredibly comfortable to hold, even if you grab it with just your fingertips.\nOther tablets are lighter. The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX, for example weighs 0.825 pounds. However, with an 8.9-inch screen, it\u2019s actually a smaller tablet.\nThe effect of the iPad Air\u2019s thin profile, largish 9.7 inch screen and now decreased bevel size is that you feel as if you\u2019re holding the screen, or rather, what\u2019s on the screen in your hand, and the rest, what there is of it, fades into the background. It's a trick no other consumer tablet effectively pulls off.\n\nIt\u2019s What\u2019s Inside That Counts\nApple\u2019s now spreading its powerful A7 chip across the top tier of its mobile products line. Although the company assiduously avoids details about mobile CPU clock speeds, we know that the A7 is a 64-bit dual-core CPU that runs at roughly 1.3GHz. Amazon is currently packing Snapdragon 800 quad-core CPUs in its new line of Kindle Fire HDX tablets. I can tell you from experience that the new Kindle Fire is plenty fast. Even so, the Apple iPad Air\u2019s dual-core A7 felt just as powerful. No process or task ever lagged.\nThe A7 is paired with a M7 coprocessor. Its job is to monitor all the motion sensors in the iPad Air, essentially taking that task off the core CPU\u2019s hands. That may be part of the reason the A7 operates so efficiently. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to see exactly what the M7 is doing right now without a bunch third-party tools (hardware and software) to access it. Apple tells me they\u2019re waiting for third-party companies to take advantage of the M7 (the same chip pair can be found in the iPhone 5S and iPad Mini Retina).\nThe iPad Air\u2019s screen is not only exactly the same 2,048 x 1,536 resolution as the previous iPad, it\u2019s the same resolution as the smaller-screen iPad Mini Retina. The funny thing about these Retina screens, which supposedly describe a resolution as fine as the eye can perceive, is that other tablet manufacturers are now offering even higher resolutions. The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and Google\u2019s Nexus 10 both offer 2,560 x 1,600 displays, though the former is a smaller screen and the latter is a larger one.\nI\u2019ve had some hands-on time with the 8.9-inch HDX (and reviewed the HDX 7-inch, which has more pixels per inch than the iPad Air), and I honestly cannot tell the difference between those screens and the iPad Air\u2019s retina display. They all look fantastic.\nThe Look of iOS\n\nApple\u2019s new mobile operating system, iOS 7, looks great on the iPad Air. The large screen offers plenty of room for sweeping up from just outside the screen to access the Control Center, where you can quickly adjust brightness, audio volume, the clock, the camera, airplane mode and more, and sweeping down to see your daily calendar and notifications. You can also place your finger on the home screen, in between your apps, pull down and access Spotlight search. It\u2019s one of my favorite iOS 7 features.\nIf you\u2019re running multiple apps, as I always am, you can use four fingers to quickly gesture through them (which kind of reminds me of how on Windows 8.1 RT you pull running apps into focus from just outside the screen).  A double press of the home button shows you which apps you're running in a sort of carousel view. A flick of the finger is all it takes to dismiss one.\nThe base of the screen starts with four fixed apps: iMessage, Mail, Safari and Music. It can hold up to five apps and you can choose any five you like.\nEven though iOS 7 is the most radical redesign since iOS\u2019s inception in 2007, the platform is still very, very recognizable. If you like Apple\u2019s ecosystem, you will not be disappointed. Personally, iOS remains my favorite mobile platform. I think it\u2019s smart, super-navigable and rarely, if ever, makes you think you\u2019re using a computer. I cannot say the same thing about the confused Windows 8.1 RT (on the Surface 2) or even Amazon\u2019s Fire OS Android overlay, which, while doing an excellent job of hiding Android\u2019s geekier parts still, on occasion, has to lead you to the nerdiness underneath.\nSuper Fun Time\n\nIf you are looking for a tablet that will entertain you 24/7, the iPad Air fits the bill. There are roughly a half a million iPad Apps available and while you sometimes can\u2019t find the coolest games on competing platforms, you will always find them in the App Store. I have my personal favorites; Asphalt 8, Batman: Arkham Origins, Limbo, and Infinity Blade III. All but one are available on Android, but the latter\u2019s absence is notable. Fears of content piracy, which may or may not still be well-founded have kept developers like Chair Entertainment, which makes IBIII, off Google\u2019s platform.\nStill, for my tests, I played Infinity Blade III because it's a rare 64-bit mobile game built from the ground up to take advantage of the A7. On the iPad Air, it loads super fast (as compared to previous iPads), and everything is rendered in exquisite detail. For platform comparison, I also played a game I can find on Android: Asphalt 8. This first-person racer offers intense driving action, beautifully rendered race cars and incredible environments. I raced through Nevada, Iceland, London and Tokyo on both the iPad Air and Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire HDX 7.  The game worked perfectly on both tablets, though I certainly prefer iPad Air\u2019s larger screen.\nI also played both while wearing headphones and using the built-in speakers. Audio quality on the HDX 7 was a bit louder than through the iPad Air\u2019s speakers, but otherwise the differences weren\u2019t all that noticeable.\nMusic and Movies\nAs I mentioned, Music is one of the default home items on the iPad Air, which makes sense since Apple sort of made its mobile bones in music. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s content-consumption-friendly Kindle Fire HDX, naturally, features books as one of its main menu items (Music is right after that).  Apple doesn\u2019t even include iBooks on the iPad \u2014 you need to download the app for free. \nMost of Apple\u2019s content-consumption apps, like music, feature iOS 7\u2019s skeumorphic-free design. In fact, music is possibly a bit too austere and white for my tastes.  iBooks, oddly, still looks like a real book shelf.  Even Amazon has moved away from a realistic-looking shelf.\n\nReading in either device is a pleasure, though I have to say I especially enjoyed consuming comic books via the comiXology app on the iPad Air. The artwork on DC\u2019s Earth One Superman graphic novel looked amazing, and convinced me that I could enjoy reading digital comic books and that they look best on a larger screen.\n\nNewsstand is where you read newspaper and magazines on the iPad. This got an upgrade in iOS 7 and it looks quite sharp. While I didn\u2019t get animated page turns on the copy of Men\u2019s Journal I downloaded, the pages and images looked stunning.\nFor reading books, I prefer a small, dedicated reading device like Amazon\u2019s Kindle Paperwhite. That\u2019s said, the iPad Air is a very able backlit reading device. Apple even added a neat trick that lets you rest your finger on the edge of the page and turn pages with another finger.\n\nBoth Amazon and Apple have very rich movie libraries (for rental and purchase). Playback on either device looks fantastic. Overall, however, Amazon may have a bit of an edge here. If you pay $75 a year you gain access to Amazon\u2019s expansive library of streaming content. To be fair, Netflix members need only download the app on their iPad Air to start enjoying streaming content.\nThe Amazon Kindle Fire HDX also includes X-Ray, an IMDb-powered database of information about the actors and trivia in many of the movies. There are similar X-Rays tools for books and music. The iPad has no such integrated, content-consumption-centric tools.\nSpeaking of music, Apple now offers iTunes Radio, free streaming music in a variety of genres. You can also build your own stations. It\u2019s a decent alternative to Pandora and Spotify. Amazon does not have a similar offering, though its X-Ray for music adds lyrics that play back alongside supported tunes.\nLive It\nAt $499 for a 16 GB, Wi-Fi-only model, Apple is unapologetically charging at least $100 more than most comparable tablets. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, for example, costs $379 for a 16GB Wi-Fi model. In fairness to Apple, Amazon does force the user to accept sleep-state advertising and offers (or pay $394).\nWith or without the ads, Amazon\u2019s tablets, which offer equal levels of power, performance, and utility are simply cheaper. Apple doesn\u2019t really address the price issue, but it is finally offering more value \u2014 up front \u2014 for those who buy its newest technology.\nAnyone who buys the iPad Air can download both the iWork productivity suite and the iLife creativity suite for free. This is not like typical free software where you get a couple of features in the trial version ad have to pay $30 or more for full functionality. These are very rich apps, of varying utility, that I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll want to download.\n\niWork is a good, but not comparable, substitute for Microsoft Office. The Keynote presentation app is one of the better tools in the suite. Even without a physical keyboard or mouse, it\u2019s remarkably easy to pull together a colorful, animated and, dare I say it, entertaining presentation.\nPages is a solid word processor, loaded with templates and even more powerful tools like tracking. It\u2019s nowhere near as rich as, say, Microsoft Word, but it\u2019s certainly more powerful than the document tool in Google Apps. I\u2019m not a fan of the Numbers spreadsheet app \u2014 as soon as I used it I wanted to run back to my PC and the comfort of Microsoft Excel.\n\nIn iLife, there\u2019s the updated iMovie. Like most of Apple\u2019s other new apps, this version drops the cheesy skeumorphism in favor of a multi-pane workspace that makes capturing and adding HD video a snap. What\u2019s more remarkable is how smoothly the iPad Air (and its A7 chip) handles the task. I shot and edited 1080p video, including trimming, reorganizing and even adjusting video speed, with nary a hiccup. \nSimilarly, iPhoto is a good photo-editing tool, with a wealth of filters and fun tools for creating slideshows, web journals and hardcover photobooks that can actually be printed and delivered to you (for a fee).\nIf you're a musician or musically inclined, Garageband is a revelation. It can recreate a staggering number of musical sounds and styles and lets you record, play back, sample and edit. Even if you're not a musician, it's fun to noodle around with the virtual guitar, keyboard and drums. I walked away wishing I actually had some musical talent.\nPicture This\n\nThough many of Apple\u2019s tools focus on photos and videos, Apple has not exactly advanced the state of the art in digital imagers. The iPad Air features Apple\u2019s previous generation 5MP iSight camera. This means no panorama photo or slo-mo video options. The FaceTime camera, though, appears to have gotten the same update applied to the iPhone 5C: It has much better low-light performance. In FaceTime calls with my wife, she could clearly see my face, even under dim lighting.\n Communication and Collaboration\nApple now provides a lot of incentive for owing multiple iOS and even OS X devices. As I was testing the iPad Air, I was also looking at the new MacBook Pro 15-inch and setting up my own new iPhone 5S. With one Apple account I\u2019m able to receive iMessages on all three devices. These messages are often sent to my phone number via SMS, but as long as they\u2019re received on an iOS device, iMessage sends them to all devices. Similarly, I can communicate with any of my contacts through the iMessage platform on all of these devices.\nApple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google all offer excellent cloud-based services. Apple iCloud is great for backing up the iPad Air, storing and sharing work files and making sure all my photos and videos end up safely stored in the cloud \u2014 and away from fallible and losable local hardware. Unfortunately, Apple\u2019s base (free) iCloud offering of 5GB is kind of skimpy. Microsoft offers 200GB of free storage if you buy a Surface 2 or Surface Pro 2. Amazon offers unlimited storage for any content you buy from them, but only 5GB of free space for your files. \nI tested a 128GB iPad Air ($799 for Wi-Fi only) and for most people I recommend at least the 32GB model ($599 for Wi-Fi only) . How are you supposed to back that up to a 5GB space, especially if you won two or more iOS devices?\nBrowsing and Email\n\nEmail setup and usage is just as easy as ever on the iPad Air. iOS 7 has made the act of deleting mail incredibly quick. I like that.\nSafari got a significant makeover in iOS 7, but it's not consistent across mobile devices. For now, the iPad version lacks my favorite feature: the ability to view web pages in a card view and dismiss open tabs by flicking them away. It's still a very good browser and the Shared Links from those you follow on Twitter (under Bookmarks) is especially useful. \nBattery Life and Connectivity\nApple promised 10 hours of battery life on the iPad Air. My model, which came with Verizon 4G LTE, gave me more than a full day of usage that included movies, music, web browsing, email, action game-playing, video editing, photo editing, and more. At the end of the day, I still had roughly 50% power.\nLTE connectivity was strong and the iPad Air is available in virtually every other band you can think of and will be available on Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Sprint in the U.S.\nWi-Fi technology also got an upgrade. The iPad Air is using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antennas, a multi-antenna Wi-Fi technology that\u2019s actually more than a few years old, but can improve connectivity and throughput. In my tests, I did notice that, over Wi-Fi, HD movies downloaded significantly faster than they did on, for instance, an iPad 2 or even the more recent iPad Mini (first generation).\nWhy I Love It\nIs the Apple iPad Air a major innovation in tablets? No. Heck, it doesn\u2019t even have the cool, or oddball, Mayday 24/7 video-chat customer service found in the new Amazon Kindle Fire HDX devices. Time will tell if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.  For me, though, the question is not which tablet offers the most whiz-bang features. It\u2019s which one serves as the ultimate consumer device.\nYes, I know, tablets live and survive in the workplace. iPads started showing up in my meetings almost as soon as they were introduced more than three years ago. The iPad Air is up for the corporate challenge, and is, obviously, lighter than any Ultrabook (so it's easy to carry around the office). That said, it\u2019s also an excellent content-consumption, entertainment and connectivity device. So, too, is the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX. I like that tablet quite a bit, though I still think the iPad Air has the design edge over it and all other tablets on the market.\nYes, it\u2019s true, the iPad Air is essentially a larger iPad Mini Retina. For some, that\u2019s a disappointment. For me, the new iPad Air is close to everything a consumer tablet should be: Light, fast, fun, beautiful and a little bit like the future. \nThe Lowdown\nWhat's Good\n\nExcellent design\nHuge app library\nSparking performance\nFree iWork and iLife\n\nWhat's Bad\n\nMore expensive than competitors\nNo Touch ID fingerprint sensor\n\nBottom LineApple made tablets cool and still leads the pack when it comes to design, performance and overall desirability with the iPad Air.\nHave something to add to this story?

               </a>
               . In fact, if youve ever seen an iPad Mini, you know exactly what the iPad Air looks like: its essentially a larger clone.
              </p>

              <p>
               If youve never had the pleasure of touching or seeing an iPad Mini in person, the iPad Air is most easily described as an elegant slab. The back is almost entirely brushed aluminum (it comes in standard aluminum color and "space gray"  my test unit is the latter). The LTE model has a plastic bar at the top for the antenna, and theres a 5-megapixel iSight camera on the back.
              </p>
              <p>
               The lightly tapered edges house metal volume buttons and a rotation-lock/mute switch on one side, a power/sleep button and 3.5mm audio jack on top, and the Lighting port and speakers on the bottom edge.
              </p>
              <p>
               The front is very familiar-looking, a black or white face with a 9.7-inch screen, a 1.2MP (720p) FaceTime camera and the very familiar Home bottom near the bottom. Apple didn't include its new

               technology in the iPad Air. When I asked them about this, their explanation was vague, but equated to, We just added it in the iPhone 5s, so... For what its worth, Im so used to unlocking my 5S with my thumb that I truly missed this feature on the iPad Air.

               </a>
               (and really all other previous iPad editions) and this one: the iPad Air is almost three-quarters-of-an-inch narrower. Thats right, Apple managed to make the iPad Air thinner and smaller while maintaining the exact same screen size.

               , for example weighs 0.825 pounds. However, with an 8.9-inch screen, its actually a smaller tablet.
              </p>
              <p>
               The effect of the iPad Airs thin profile, largish 9.7 inch screen and now decreased bevel size is that you feel as if youre holding the screen, or rather, whats on the screen in your hand, and the rest, what there is of it, fades into the background. It's a trick no other consumer tablet effectively pulls off.

                A7 chip

               across the top tier of its mobile products line. Although the company assiduously avoids details about mobile CPU clock speeds, we know that the A7 is a 64-bit dual-core CPU that runs at roughly 1.3GHz. Amazon is currently packing Snapdragon 800 quad-core CPUs in its new line of Kindle Fire HDX tablets. I can tell you from experience that the new Kindle Fire is plenty fast. Even so, the Apple iPad Airs dual-core A7 felt just as powerful. No process or task ever lagged.

              <p>
               The A7 is paired with a M7 coprocessor. Its job is to monitor all the motion sensors in the iPad Air, essentially taking that task off the core CPUs hands. That may be part of the reason the A7 operates so efficiently. On the other hand, its hard to see exactly what the M7 is doing right now without a bunch third-party tools (hardware and software) to access it. Apple tells me theyre waiting for third-party companies to take advantage of the M7 (the same chip pair can be found in the

               The iPad Airs screen is not only exactly the same 2,048 x 1,536 resolution as the previous iPad, its the same resolution as the smaller-screen iPad Mini Retina. The funny thing about these Retina screens, which supposedly describe a resolution as fine as the eye can perceive, is that other tablet manufacturers are now offering even higher resolutions. The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and Googles Nexus 10 both offer 2,560 x 1,600 displays, though the former is a smaller screen and the latter is a larger one.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ive had some hands-on time with the 8.9-inch HDX (and reviewed the HDX 7-inch, which has more pixels per inch than the iPad Air), and I honestly cannot tell the difference between those screens and the iPad Airs retina display. They all look fantastic.

               Apples new mobile operating system, iOS 7, looks great on the iPad Air. The large screen offers plenty of room for sweeping up from just outside the screen to access the Control Center, where you can quickly adjust brightness, audio volume, the clock, the camera, airplane mode and more, and sweeping down to see your daily calendar and notifications. You can also place your finger on the home screen, in between your apps, pull down and access Spotlight search. Its one of my favorite iOS 7 features.
              </p>
              <p>
               If youre running multiple apps, as I always am, you can use four fingers to quickly gesture through them (which kind of reminds me of how on
               <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/10/21/microsoft-surface-2-review/">

               </a>
               you pull running apps into focus from just outside the screen).  A double press of the home button shows you which apps you're running in a sort of carousel view. A flick of the finger is all it takes to dismiss one.
              </p>
              <p>
               The base of the screen starts with four fixed apps: iMessage, Mail, Safari and Music. It can hold up to five apps and you can choose any five you like.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even though iOS 7 is the most radical redesign since iOSs inception in 2007, the platform is still very, very recognizable. If you like Apples ecosystem, you will not be disappointed. Personally, iOS remains my favorite mobile platform. I think its smart, super-navigable and rarely, if ever, makes you think youre using a computer. I cannot say the same thing about the confused Windows 8.1 RT (on the

               If you are looking for a tablet that will entertain you 24/7, the iPad Air fits the bill. There are roughly a half a million iPad Apps available and while you sometimes cant find the coolest games on competing platforms, you will always find them in the App Store. I have my personal favorites;
               <em>
                Asphalt 8
               </em>
               ,
               <em>
                Batman: Arkham Origins
               </em>
               ,
               <em>
                Limbo
               </em>
               , and
               <em>
                Infinity Blade III
               </em>
               . All but one are available on Android, but the latters absence is notable. Fears of content piracy, which may or may not still be well-founded have kept developers like Chair Entertainment, which makes
               <em>
                IBIII

              <p>
               Still, for my tests, I played

               because it's a rare 64-bit mobile game built from the ground up to take advantage of the A7. On the iPad Air, it loads super fast (as compared to previous iPads), and everything is rendered in exquisite detail. For platform comparison, I also played a game I can find on Android:
               <em>
                Asphalt 8
               </em>
               . This first-person racer offers intense driving action, beautifully rendered race cars and incredible environments. I raced through Nevada, Iceland, London and Tokyo on both the iPad Air and
               <a data-crackerjax="#post-slider" href="http://mashable.com/2013/10/02/kindle-fire-hdx-review/">
                Amazons Kindle Fire HDX 7
               </a>
               .  The game worked perfectly on both tablets, though I certainly prefer iPad Airs larger screen.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also played both while wearing headphones and using the built-in speakers. Audio quality on the HDX 7 was a bit louder than through the iPad Airs speakers, but otherwise the differences werent all that noticeable.

               As I mentioned, Music is one of the default home items on the iPad Air, which makes sense since Apple sort of made its mobile bones in music. Similarly, Amazons content-consumption-friendly Kindle Fire HDX, naturally, features books as one of its main menu items (Music is right after that).  Apple doesnt even include iBooks on the iPad  you need to download the app for free.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most of Apples content-consumption apps, like music, feature iOS 7s skeumorphic-free design. In fact, music is possibly a bit too austere and white for my tastes.  iBooks, oddly, still looks like a real book shelf.  Even Amazon has moved away from a realistic-looking shelf.

               Both Amazon and Apple have very rich movie libraries (for rental and purchase). Playback on either device looks fantastic. Overall, however, Amazon may have a bit of an edge here. If you pay $75 a year you gain access to Amazons expansive library of streaming content. To be fair, Netflix members need only download the app on their iPad Air to start enjoying streaming content.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX also includes X-Ray, an IMDb-powered database of information about the actors and trivia in many of the movies. There are similar X-Rays tools for books and music. The iPad has no such integrated, content-consumption-centric tools.

               At $499 for a 16 GB, Wi-Fi-only model, Apple is unapologetically charging at least $100 more than most comparable tablets. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, for example, costs $379 for a 16GB Wi-Fi model. In fairness to Apple, Amazon does force the user to accept sleep-state advertising and offers (or pay $394).
              </p>
              <p>
               With or without the ads, Amazons tablets, which offer equal levels of power, performance, and utility are simply cheaper. Apple doesnt really address the price issue, but it is finally offering more value  up front  for those who buy its newest technology.

Like most of Apples other new apps, this version drops the cheesy skeumorphism in favor of a multi-pane workspace that makes capturing and adding HD video a snap.

I shot and edited 1080p video, including trimming, reorganizing and even adjusting video speed, with nary a hiccup.

               Though many of Apples tools focus on photos and videos, Apple has not exactly advanced the state of the art in digital imagers. The iPad Air features Apples previous generation 5MP iSight camera. This means no panorama photo or slo-mo video options. The FaceTime camera, though, appears to have gotten the same update applied to the iPhone 5C: It has much better low-light performance. In FaceTime calls with my wife, she could clearly see my face, even under dim lighting.

               Apple promised 10 hours of battery life on the iPad Air. My model, which came with Verizon 4G LTE, gave me more than a full day of usage that included movies, music, web browsing, email, action game-playing, video editing, photo editing, and more. At the end of the day, I still had roughly 50% power.

               Wi-Fi technology also got an upgrade.

In my tests, I did notice that, over Wi-Fi, HD movies downloaded significantly faster than they did on, for instance, an iPad 2 or even the more recent iPad Mini (first generation).

               Yes, I know, tablets live and survive in the workplace. iPads started showing up in my meetings almost as soon as they were introduced more than three years ago. The iPad Air is up for the corporate challenge, and is, obviously, lighter than any Ultrabook (so it's easy to carry around the office). That said, its also an excellent content-consumption, entertainment and connectivity device. So, too, is the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX. I like that tablet quite a bit, though I still think the iPad Air has the design edge over it and all other tablets on the market.

               Yes, its true, the iPad Air is essentially a larger iPad Mini Retina. For some, thats a disappointment. For me, the new iPad Air is close to everything a consumer tablet should be: Light, fast, fun, beautiful and a little bit like the future.
