       Emergency Aircraft &amp; Equipment
      </h2>
      Air Medical Flight Services operates newer, safer, faster, more comfortable, more efficient aircraft.  Reliability is high.  Fuel burn efficiencies lower costs.  Our ETA's are accurate.  We'll be there in hours, not days.  From a patient care perspective the time en route should be minimized.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Operating fast jet aircraft allows Air Medical Flight Services to complete the mission quickly and stand ready for the next mission.  A fast aircraft reduces the patient's travel time en route.  Our Learjet aircraft accomplish both objectives.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      <h2>
       We go anywhere in the world
      </h2>
      We go anywhere in the US and Canada.  Our jet aircraft are new, fast, safe and equipped with state-of-the-art medical and support equipment.  We can arrange to have a physician on the flight or even arrange to have your doctor on board.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We own and operate the jet aircraft used for your air ambulance flight.  We employ the flight and medical staff that make your long-range air ambulance flight so comfortable.  We take the guesswork out of your difficult decision in selecting a qualified, experienced, dedicated long-range air ambulance to transport your loved one.  Our flight and medical teams and aircraft are dedicated 24/7 to emergency and non-emergent air ambulance flights.  Flights originate from 6 bases strategically located across the US.  Each air medical flight is staffed by a Pilot and Co-Pilot and a Flight Nurse and Flight Paramedic.  The aircraft are owned by Air Medical Flight Services and operated under our FAA Part 135 Air Carrier (operating) Certificate.

      <h2>
       State of the Art
      </h2>
      Our Learjet aircraft are state licensed as air ambulance vehicles, are pressurized, climate controlled, and are configured with a state-of-the-art LifePort reclining medical bed with built in oxygen, suction, air compressor, and inverter.  IAMS provides an ICU environment with cardiac monitoring, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, IV infusion pumps, pulse oximetry, emergency medication, defibrillation with pacing capabilities, and advanced airway management.  Our medical crewmembers are able to communicate directly with emergency room physicians at any point in the flight.

      <h2>
       Professional 'On-Call' Readiness
      </h2>
      Our flight and medical crews are at the pinnacle of their careers.  Our dispatch, maintenance staff, and flight crews are on-station at the airport, ready to go!  When dispatch receives a call there is no half-day, or full-day wait for things to come together.
      <br/>
      Air Medical Flight Services is alone in its 'on-call' readiness and short launch window.

     <h2>
      Comprehensive Air Ambulance Service
     </h2>
     Calls to 1-800 396-5583  are received in our on-airport Dispatch center.  Dispatchers are FAA Certified and trained as Emergency Medical Technicians enhancing the exchange of patient information.  Data is entered into a customized flight tracking and medical management program.  Dispatch notifies the air medical and flight crew of the mission.  Each medical crew consists of a flight RN and flight paramedic.  Each flight crew consists of a Captain and First Officer.  The Learjet is fully prepared for flight.  The flight crew checks weather and completes appropriate check-lists.  The air-medical crew assembles for a patient status and a pre-flight briefing.  Specialized equipment and drug packs are checked out and loaded aboard the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <h2>
      Within the hour the aircraft is taxiing for take-off
     </h2>
     During the flight to the foreign or servicing airport, the flight and medical crews coordinate with Dispatch to update the ETA, clarify or revise the patient's status, and communicate any other messages or data necessary for the safe transfer of the patient.  We work in concert with an ER team, thus minimizing our time at the hospital.  When the patient is stable for transport, he or she is loaded aboard a ground ambulance and transported to the airport.  The patient is placed on a comfortable, hospital-like bed aboard the airplane.  All aboard prepare for the flight.  The aircraft has all of the medical equipment of a small emergency room.  Our crews are the very best of the best.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <h2>
      At take-off the air medical crew keeps the patient stable and comfortable
     </h2>
     Family members and flight nursing staff cheer-up, or otherwise comfort the patient.  Flight-following is conducted by Dispatch which tracks the status of the aircraft continuously.  The receiving hospital is notified and a ground ambulance awaits the arrival of the aircraft at the receiving airport.  Communications with logistical and medical support are continuous.  At 49,000 feet and over 520 mph the aircraft speeds towards its destination, coordinated by air traffic control.  On landing, the medical crew members accompany the patient to the receiving hospital.  Upon completion of the transfer, the aircraft and crew return to IAMS' operating base.  Once there, the aircraft is fueled and prepared for its next mission.   The flight crew de-briefs and rests.  The medical crew de-briefs the Chief Flight Nurse who goes over documentation to ensure the medical record is complete.  Later, the Chief Flight Nurse will follow up on the patient's status.
     <br/>

     <h2>
