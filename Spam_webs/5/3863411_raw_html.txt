  <h3>
   Easy Ways to "Sniff" Foxes on Two Meters
  </h3>
  <p>
   There is no "standard" two-meter RDF setup for on-foot use by hams in the USA. Every ham who is experienced at it has his or her own idea of what
works best in a given situation. Try the various methods described below and
see which ones you like most.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h4>
   Handie-Talkie Tricks
  </h4>
  <p>
   If you are a typical ham radio operator, all you need to get started quickly and find foxes successfully is your VHF/UHF  handi-talkie (HT) or scanner and some simple accessories. The most
elementary way is called the "body fade" or "body
shield" technique. Hold your HT tight against your chest and turn around
slowly, looking for the direction at which your body blocks the signal most
effectively (the signal null). At this point, the signal is coming from behind
you. Walk in the direction of the null, taking bearings at regular intervals, and observe the signal strength get stronger.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the signal is so strong that you can't find the null, tune 5 or 10 KHz
off frequency to put the signal into the skirts of the receiver's IF passband. If your
hand-held is dual-band (144/440 MHz) and you are hunting on two meters, try
tuning to the much weaker third harmonic of the signal in the 70 cm band while
performing the "body shield."
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <img align="right" alt="Bob Miller Yagi" height="200" src="n6zhz3.jpg" width="255"/>
   Disconnecting the HT's "rubber duck" antenna will knock down the signal even more. Hearing the signal with antenna off is usually a "You are here!" indicator. Some foxtailers wrap aluminum foil around their HTs to attenuate the signal even more. If you do this, be sure to put insulating tape over the battery charging terminals on the bottom of the set first. You might damage the radio by shorting these terminals with the foil.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The "body fade" null, which is rather shallow to begin with, can be filled in by
signal reflections (multipath), nearby objects, etc. When using this method, stay away from large buildings,
chain-link fences, metal signs, and the like. If you do not get a good null,
move to a clearer location and try again.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h4>
   Using Directional Antennas
  </h4>
  <p>
   You'll get much more accurate bearings, plus more sensitivity when hunting weak signals, if you use an antenna with forward gain and directivity such as a yagi, cubical quad, or phased array. The technique is simple, just point the antenna toward the horizon and turn your body in a 360-degree circle to find the direction in which the signal is strongest, just as if you were turning a rooftop TV antenna for best picture. When signal strength is greatest, the high-gain antenna is "pointing" toward the signal source. You could remove and carry 
the 4-element yagi or quad that you normally use for mobile T-hunting, but it's
rather large and cumbersome. You don't need that much gain and pattern
sharpness --- two or three elements will do nicely.
  </p>
  <p>
   A good ready-to-hunt choice for two meters is the
   <a href="http://www.rdfantennas.com/bc-146-565.php" target="_blank">
    3-element yagi by Bob Miller Enterprises
   </a>
   (above right). Element rods fold along the boom for easy storage and transit. Each antenna is hand-built and tuned for best match by N6ZHZ.

    for May 1996. Elements are quarter-inch diameter aluminum rod in a PVC pipe frame. Element spacing is only four inches on the two meter band, but the directional characteristics are excellent. Its PVC handle makes it easy to hold for vertical polarization.
    <p>
     Another good sniffing antenna is the Shrunken Quad on pages 173-176 of the book
     <a href="THRDFSinfo.html">
      Transmitter Hunting--Radio Direction Finding Simplified (THRDFS)
     </a>
     . It is more compact than
a yagi or phased array and is safer because it does not have long pointed
elements. It is somewhat tricky to tune and has a narrow bandwidth (about 500
KHz), but it is an excellent choice if most of your hunts are on one frequency such as the southern California
coordinated transmitter hunt frequency (146.565 MHz).

     The directional pattern of WB2HOL's 3-element beam is pretty good, but users have noted that feedline signal pickup can make bearings unreliable by moving the maximum lobe off-axis. I recommend adding a "choke" balun in the coax line (photo at left) to minimize RF current on the exterior of the feedline. Wrap about 7 turns of the feedline (with jacket in place) around the boom behind the reflector. (It will not work as well if you put the turns between the driven element and the reflector.) Cover with duct tape or cloth tape to keep the turns in place. (Tape was partially removed for the photo.)
    </p>
    <p>
     <img align="right" alt="Plastic handle and holders" height="207" src="/miscpix/greenhandle3.jpg" width="300"/>
     The biggest problem with two-meter RDF yagis is how to hold onto them while beating the bushes for hidden transmitters. Grasping the middle of the boom is awkward and it introduces body capacitance that may affect antenna performance. Using the extension of the boom behind the reflector as a grip solves the hand-in-the-antenna problem, but it is even more awkward because the entire antenna pulls the hand down at the wrist. Most pre-teens cannot hold an antenna this way for more than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     A handle at the balance point of the boom keeps body parts out of the field of the beam and eliminates torque on the wrist.   
Julianne Walsh, KI6DYX and her husband Peter manufacture a clever plastic handle assembly that clamps to the boom of your measuring-tape yagi. Atop the handle is a compartment that is just the right size to hold an offset attenuator circuit board. They also make plastic rings that hold the elements securely in place to the boom, as well as a plastic platform to secure a handi-talkie or scanner behind the reflector by its belt clip. Several bright colors are available, as shown in the photo at right.

    <h3>
     Closing In
    </h3>
    <p>
     At the start point, you can usually use your handi-talkie's S-meter to take bearings with
your RDF antenna. When you get so close that the S-meter goes off scale,
you will need to reduce (attenuate) the signal into the receiver. Simple resistive RF attenuators that are commonly used
for mobile hunting are of limited use, because the signal will bypass the
attenuator and and go through the receiver case by the time you have put in a
few attenuation steps. To reduce direct pickup by the receiver, you can try aluminum foil shielding, as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have a dual-band hand-held, you get will the equivalent of 40 to 60 dB
attenuation by tuning it to the third harmonic of the hunt frequency. A small
UHF yagi or quad will give sharp bearings on the hidden T's third harmonic when
you are within a few dozen feet.

     <img align="left" alt="Offset Attenuator Photo" height="209" src="atten.jpg" width="140"/>
     <b>
      The favorite signal reduction device of on-foot foxhunters with beams is an "active," or "offset" attenuator. It converts a strong on-frequency signal into a weaker off-frequency signal, usually from 1 MHz to 5 MHz up or down the dial. To use it, tune your receiver to the offset signal, then adjust the attenuator for the needed
attenuation, from 20 dB to 100 dB or more. Signal leakage into the receiver case is not
a problem with this kind of attenuator.

     What ARDF Champions Use
    </h3>
    <p>
     You might think that all competitors in an international foxhunting championship should be required to use the same type of receiving equipment and that all sets
should give identical performance. But that's not practical. Equipment preferences and availability
vary greatly from country to country. The IARU rules for
championships instruct all entrants to bring their own gear.  Any type of RDF set
is allowed, so long as it can be carried by the contestant and does not radiate
any signals that would interfere with the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It's possible to do very well in multi-nation ARDF events with your HT or scanner, beam, and offset attenuator as described above. But the majority of experienced radio-orienteers eventually opt for a lightweight one-piece receiver/antenna set with added features such as tone-pitch signal-strength indicator. No such sets are commercially manufactured in the USA at this time, but they are available from foreign sources in kit or wired/tested form.

        ARDF championships in Europe and Asia use amplitude-modulated (AM) transmitters on two meters, unlike the USA where frequency modulation (FM) is more popular. On heavily modulated AM transmissions, the audio S-meter circuit in the Sniffer4 may not work well. Another set from Australia, the Ron Graham (VK4BRG) Electronics (RGE) RX-1 two-meter receiver (photo at right) may be better under these circumstances. It covers 2.5 MHz of the band with high sensitivity, good selectivity, smooth varactor tuning and AM detection. FM signals can be slope-detected, but the audio quality will not be good. There is a wide-range RF gain control (internal attenuator) and audio-pitch S-meter. The RX-1 is designed to mount on the RGE model VHF-144 two-element HB9CV-style two-element beam, which has steel-tape element ends covered with flexible tubing for ruggedness and safety.

         Most foxhunters in former Soviet Union countries use 80's-vintage RDF sets made
at the Barnaul Radio Factory in southern Siberia. The Russian Altai-145 is a
complete two-meter receiver/antenna unit in one piece. The AM receiver is
built into the boom of a 3-element yagi. The foxhunter holds it overhead and
orients the yagi for loudest signal in the earphones. For safety in the woods,
the yagi elements are made of curved steel tape.  The receiver is capacitor-tuned
(non-synthesized). There is no FM detector or BFO, but it has a quencher
circuit that interrupts the signal at an audio rate to create an audible tone
in the user's headphones. Slope detection of FM signals works OK. There is
no S-meter.  Sensitivity is low, approximately 7 microvolts threshold.

         Pre-owned Altai-145's are occasionally available at "street prices" of US$80 to US$100. They were used successfully in the 1993 Friendship Radiosport Games in
Victoria, Canada. However, they cover only 144-146 MHz as supplied, which is the two meter band
range in IARU Regions 1 and 3. Modification to move or increase the frequency range is possible, but frequency range shifts as the 9V battery discharges. A more severe problem is the Altai's lack of sufficient
IF-stage selectivity to perform reliably in the crowded band
conditions of a typical US city. Stations up to 50 KHz away can cause serious
QRM. Altais work much better in Russia, where two meter repeaters are less prevalent.

         In Japan, commercial foxhunt receiver/antenna units made by Mizuho are often used. The Model FRX-2001 features a synthesized receiver built into the boom of a
two-element HB9CV phased array beam, with selectable AM and FM detection. The spring-wire
phased array is smaller than an equivalent yagi, making it excellent for use in
the brush. Electronic attenuation and audible strength indication are
included, along with an S-meter. An audio-pitch signal strength circuit feeds
one channel of stereo headphones, with receiver audio in the other channel.
The FRX-2001 tunes 144-146 MHz, but can be changed to cover 146-148 MHz by a
modification of the synthesizer. This unit is not marketed in the USA
at this time, because Mizuho importers do not believe that the cost of FCC Part 15
certification will be recovered by the small number of projected sales at
strong-yen prices. Estimated retail cost in the USA would be at least $300.

        <p>
         The sensitivity of your two-meter ARDF equipment should be about the same as that of a handie-talkie. In an international championship foxhunt, the first transmitter will be at
least 3/4 of a kilometer from the starting point, running as little as 250
milliwatts. Tuned or untuned field strength meters (such as the Sniff-Amp on pages 173-176 of
         <a href="THRDFSinfo.html">
          THRDFS
         </a>
         ) and
commercial "bug detectors" do not have sufficient sensitivity to hunt at this
distance. However, such low-sensitivity units can be helpful when you are a few yards away
from a well-concealed transmitter and you can't get enough attenuation with
your sensitive equipment.

         is still popular with search
and rescue teams that hunt Emergency Locator Transmitters in the wilderness. It consists of a dual-dipole antenna set, switcher, and receiver with
attenuator and zero-center meter. It has two modes for RDF. The switched mode
gives a very sharp left-right indication on the meter, making it easy for the
user to walk the bearing line toward the transmitter. In the non-switched
mode, the antenna performs like a two-element phased array and the meter reads
signal strength; this is better for very weak signals.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The sharpness of the zero crossing indication in the switched mode makes
possible more precise bearings than those obtainable with a quad or yagi. Under ideal field conditions, bearing accuracy is within one
degree. Meter deflection tells the user which way to turn to zero the meter. For example, a negative (left) reading requires turning the antenna left. This
solves the 180 degree ambiguity caused by the two zero crossings in each
complete rotation of the antenna system.

          Dual-antenna add-on sets give sharp left-right indications similar to the

principle, which ignores amplitude variations in the signal. No attenuator is

           The SuperDF by BMG Engineering is no longer made, but you might find a pre-owned unit. The above sets all use left/right LED indicators or a zero-center meter to show deviation of the
signal from the bearing line. By contrast, the Handy Tracker by Joe Moell KOV is a simple TDOA set with
two audible null patterns to resolve the front/back ambiguity, instead of LEDs
or a meter. It uses only one IC and has a smaller antenna pair than the others. Complete plans were in

           Add-ons which provide only a tone null indicating the front/back bearing line, but do not resolve the 180-degree ambiguity, are also available. These sets are not recommended for radio-orienteering because they give you a 50/50
chance of going the wrong direction. However, there are modifications to improve their performance. For details, see

           Objects near the observer such as concrete/steel buildings, power lines, and
chain-link fences will distort the incoming TDOA wavefront and give directional errors. Even a dense grove of trees can have an adverse effect. It is always
best to take your bearings in locations which are as open and clear as possible, and
to take them from numerous positions for confirmation. Keep checking as you move along to "eyeball average" the readings. Some TDOA RDF
sets have a slow-response mode that aids the averaging process.

           Because most TDOA sets use relative phase information only and pay no attention to signal level, they make it difficult
to gauge distance to the signal source. It is not uncommon to see a TDOA-using foxhunter walk over
the top of a concealed transmitter and walk away, following the opposite 180
degree null, because there is no indication of "You are here!" signal strength. To avoid being fooled,
keep moving and take bearings very frequently, verifying that you are still
approaching by carefully observing the left/right indication.

           TDOA sets were were plagued by cross-modulation from out-of-band signals when
used with extended-range hand-helds in the 1991 Portland Friendship Games
foxhunt. This can be a serious problem if there are strong VHF-FM transmitters
nearby and the receiver's front end has very broad response.  The solution in this case was to use only handi-talkies with narrow-range front ends, such as the Icom IC-2AT, Tempo S1 and Radio Shack HTX-202.

           Switched-pattern and TDOA sets have vertical antenna elements.  They may not
perform well if the fox transmitters are horizontally polarized, depending on multipath
conditions at the site. IARU ARDF rules call for fox antennas to be
horizontal, and all are that way in Europe and Asia. But many clubs in the USA choose to use vertical whips on foxboxes for local hunts. It should be noted that experienced European foxhunters
claim that DFing vertically polarized signals in the woods is much more
difficult than DFing horizontal signals, because signal reflections are
more prominent with vertical polarization.
