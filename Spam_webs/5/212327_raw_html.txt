  <h2>
   Varieties of Left-Handed Writing
  </h2>
  <p>
   How do left-handed people write?  Here are some common methods, and some uncommon ones.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   First, for comparison purposes, here's a schematic showing how a right-handed person writes:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="leftdex.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   When a left-handed person tries to write like a right handed person, it doesn't work, because the action of their wrist makes the writing slant the wrong way:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="leftback.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
   This form of left-handed handwriting is usually called
   <b>
    backhand
   </b>
   ; it's main disadvantage is that it tends to be illegible (since it distorts the letter forms).  It also identifies the writer as left-handed, which some people prefer to conceal.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   To make their handwriting slant the right way, the majority of left-handed people twist their wrists clockwise, so they're writing from above:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="leftcrab.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
   This form of writing, known as
   <b>
    crabclaw
   </b>
   , leads to smeared ink (or smudged graphite), prevents the writer from seeing what's been written, and is uncomfortable.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   In school, left-handed children are sometimes encouraged to turn the paper slightly counter-clockwise, so that they won't have to twist their wrists so far:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="left45.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
   A full 90-degree counter-clockwise turn of the paper puts the wrist back in the position analogous to that used by a right-handed person:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="left90.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
   (but that's a little too radical for most elementary school teachers).
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   In a seldom-seen variant, the paper is turned 90 degrees
   <b>
    clockwise
   </b>
   , like this:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="left270.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
   What's remarkable about this form of writing is that it is
   <b>
    upside-down
   </b>
   from all the others: the stroke
   <b>
    away
   </b>
   from the body produces a
   <b>
    downward
   </b>
   stroke on the paper!  Because of this inversion, it is the hardest left-handed handwriting to learn (at least, the hardest to learn of those that produce readable writing -- see below for the one which doesn't).  In many other respects, however, it is superior to the previous methods.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   Leonardo da Vinci was left-handed; he solved the left handed writing problem by simply mirroring what a right-handed person does:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <center>
   <img src="leftleo.gif"/>
  </center>
  <p>
   Of course, this produces mirror handwriting, but if you're mainly writing notes (or notebooks) for yourself, that is not such a disadvantage!
