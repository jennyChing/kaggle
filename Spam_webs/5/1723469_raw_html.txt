      <span style="background-color: initial;">
       When the idea for National Adjunct Walkout Day was first floated last fall on social media, the plan was simple: Designate a single day of action, and stage events nationwide that would call attention to adjuncts often-low pay, lack of job security, and challenging working conditions. In contingent circles, the idea spread like wildfire.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      But there was an obvious challenge: Not everyone had the option of walking out. Many adjuncts on unionized campuses were prohibited from doing so by their collective bargaining agreements; other part-time professors felt that they simply couldnt afford to leave their classrooms.
     </p>
     <p>
      So instead, the event aimed to give adjuncts the freedom and flexibility to tailor events to their particular campuses and circumstances. The result?
      <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Today-Is-National-Adjunct/190339/" target="_blank">
       Its hard to estimate
      </a>
      just how many people actually took part in the national walkout, held Wednesday. But in addition to the part-time faculty members who left their classrooms, others led campus protests, organized teach-in events, and followed along on the Twitter hashtag #NAWD, among other actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heres a quick glimpse at some of what went on:
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Protests
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On some campuses, such as the University of Arizona and the University of California at Santa Cruz, part-time faculty, along with some full-time colleagues and students, took the walkout concept literally.
     </p>
     <p>
      At Arizona, a group of about 300 people gathered in the universitys Alumni Plaza, located near the administration building, to hear 12 speakers discuss academic labor and participate in call-and-response chants.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tone wasnt of victimization, hand-wringing, and woe is us, said Joel E.R. Smith, a lecturer in the English department who helped organize the event. The message was positive. We increased our visibility and showed how valuable our contributions are to the university.
     </p>
     <p>
      The crowd was diverse, he said, adding that he even saw one of the universitys vice provosts participating. A very exciting thing happened today, he said. It was electric.
     </p>
     <p>
      In California, a similar, albeit more colorful, effort transpired on campus. A group of about 150 faculty members and students marched around campus for an hour and a half, hoisting life-sized puppets depicting
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1059039590778756&amp;set=gm.893758597329036&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">
       Saint Precaria,
      </a>
      a fictional patron saint of adjuncts (some of whom have taken to referring to themselves as the precariat). The marchers handed out informational pamphlets and buttons on their route.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chris Hables Gray, a lecturer in the schools Crown College, said tenured faculty members and administrators joined in the pilgrimage, chanted, and sang songs. A TV crew followed us the whole way, so the general public will know, students know, theyll tell other students, he said. This is just another step forward. Its progress.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       The Teach-In
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Rather than cancel courses for the day, adjuncts elsewhere used classroom time to teach students and others about their circumstances. At George Mason University, adjunct professors organized a teach-in at which speakers addressed different aspects of labor issues in academia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Basak Durgun, a graduate teaching assistant in the cultural studies program, helped organize the event, which was held at the student center on the Fairfax, Va., campus and drew between 30 and 40 participants. The response, she said, was incredibly encouraging.
     </p>
     <p>
      It felt like the GMU community has been waiting for something like this to happen, Durgun said, so that we can air out our conversations and think collectively about possible solutions. The Wednesday event may have had a limited audience, but George Masons adjuncts used the event to generate some other local publicity: Durgun noted that the student newspaper published a full-page interview about the event, and the universitys provost announced that he would create a task force to address labor concerns.
     </p>
     <p>
      We think that this is a very positive development and receive it as our first victory on campus, Durgun said.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Individual Action
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On campuses where there were no formal events planned, some adjuncts took their own steps. At Butte College, in California, Sarah Klotz, an associate instructor of English, showed a documentary,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlmWBEz4bfo" target="_blank">
       <em>
        Con Job: Stories of Adjunct and Contingent Labor,
       </em>
      </a>
      to three sections of her critical-thinking course.
     </p>
     <p>
      Her decision to show the documentary instead of leaving the lecture hall, she said, was largely financial.
     </p>
     <p>
      I only get paid for credit hours I teach, so if I walk out on my two classes on Wednesday, I miss out on one-third of a weeks pay, she said in an interview Tuesday. Associate faculty are unionized at Butte College, but this is not a formal strike, so the employment protections of a sanctioned strike do not apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the movie she led a discussion about labor conditions at Butte and asked students to think about how they might propose to solve labor problems in academe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Students in her class were shocked, she said. They had no idea there were distinctions with professors, she said. They asked about a union, they said they wanted to write letters.
     </p>
     <p>
      And though Klotz made only a small contribution to the national day, she said, she believes it was effective in raising awareness.
     </p>
     <p>
      I think students, in general, look at teachers and see professionals that get paid $60,000 to $80,000, have nice cars, Klotz said. They are really not informed. Today was a first step.

         As a tenured professor I wrote the commentary below for our university newspaper. I also facilitated a conversation in all of my classes on/about the present status of part-time faculty.I encourage other tenured professors to do the same.

         I used the PBS Newshour report about adjuncting and a ppt provided on the #NAWD page to do a teach in for my Intro to Soc and Social Problems classes. We talked about the hierarchy of positions (which fit right in to our unit on bureaucracy), the lack of job security and whether or not the academy was a good career choice for my student looking that far ahead.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         I felt like they were with me, I had some ask what they could do, others were just alarmed, but I felt I got to do my part and reach about 70-80 students on my own.

         Headline:Shedding light on part-time and contingent faculty
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         ByJohn Kilbourne
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Guest columnist
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         This past week in my Foundations of the Human Movement Sciences course at Grand Valley State University, students have been learning about Adam Smith, capitalism and capitalisms relationship to modern games, sport and health.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         In class, I was reminded again that a critical part of capitalism is an informed and educated customer/buyer/consumer. For some reason, as I reflected on educated customers and buyers, I thought about our students and next weeks planned, National Adjunct Walkout Day onWednesday, Feb. 25.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         National Adjunct Walkout Day is a nationwide protest to shed light on the current status of part-time and contingent faculty. I wondered how many students at GVSU, in Michigan or even nationally were aware of the planned protest to raise awareness about part-time and contingent faculty.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Students, after all, are the customers and buyers of education at colleges and universities, and their collective voice and actions are important in terms of keeping the producers  being college and university boards and administration  accountable.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The facts as put forward in a 2014 report by the United States House of Representatives titled, The Just-In-Time Professor: A Staff Report Summarizing eForum Responses on the Working Conditions of Contingent Faculty in Higher Education said the following:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         There is a growing and visible trend of part-time and contingent faculty (75.5 percent of instructors at institutions granting two or four degrees held contingent jobs and/or were not on the track to tenure);
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The pay is low (medium pay for thestandard three-credit course is $2,700);
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The hours are long and often involve commutes from one job to another;
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         There is virtually no access to employer-provided benefits like healthcare and retirement;
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Job instability is high with unpredictable course loads; and,
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Despite that fact that part-time faculty are highly skilled (a vast majority have Masters degrees, 50 percent have Ph.D.s) there are problems with career advancement and professional support.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The report states that, In short, adjuncts and other contingent faculty likely make up the most highly educated and experienced workers on food stamps and other public assistance in the country (p. 26). For a full copy of the report go to:
         <a href="http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/sites/democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/files/documents/1.24.14-AdjunctEforumReport.pdf">
          http://1.usa.gov/1aPfZHF
         </a>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Students at GVSU and beyond should be aware of the facts regarding faculty who teach at colleges and universities. At present, I am not aware of any movement at GVSU for part-time or contingent faculty to participate in next Wednesdays protest. That is a decision that each part-time or contingent faculty will need to make on their own.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         I will say however that, being a tenured professor, I support the actions of ALL faculty to educate and inform our students about the current status of part-time and contingent faculty at GVSU and beyond. One channel to shedding more light on the above might be for students to ask their professors about their status  are they are satisfied with their current working conditions?

          Bentley University Adjunct Professors voted today for a union, 108-42!
         </strong>
         Success at last after our first campaign lost by 2 votes last year---It looks like New England's Adjunct Action is working, school by school! And thanks to Sydni Dunn for solid coverage all the way----

         As a Maryland community college adjunct, I have no legal right to collective bargaining. Our Coalition of Academic Labor, working with SEIU 500, is working now to have legislation enacted in Annapolis that will give us collective bargaining rights. Community college faculty from around the state,including my school, CCBC, will be testifying and attending state hearings on March 10. Yesterday, adjunctsset up a table in the library snack bar and distributed buttons and literature to students, faculty, and staff. More actions are planned by COA for next month.

         Excuse me for just a minute. The nonwalk out walk out demonstrates just how insidious the system is.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The purpose is to make a point aboi one's value to the insitution and to establish some manner of bargaining viability for better this or that -- one might start with respect, but that may be too high on the ladderto start. So if I understand this correctly:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         1. many couldn't walk out because thery were part of the same union as full time faculty which revents a walk out. Certainly I am not the only one who finds this curious.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         2. wouldn't walk out because thier classes were just so importan they couldn't miss a days class
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         3. dedicated to their students more precious than gold
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         First of of all to be beholden to a system that represents theprocess that abuses your time, talent, skill, dedication, love of teaching and students is self defeating. I take it this is the same union that uses adjuncts/contigency instructors as part of the bargaining process that benefits and protects full time instructors.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Your emotional, and heartfelt symbolic protest of solidarity with those who did walk out is noted but utterly worthless and lacks any sense of courage, or self respect, either that or you are quite content to live in the environemnt about which you whine constantly.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         I am not a fan unions for public services. They are notoriously management oriented and abusive of the public trust. adjuncts would be better off as independent contractors setting their own salary markers as well forgoing the boot licking in the hopes of obtaining full time employment for the benefit of getting a healthcare plan, which one now must have or befined -- peculiar in a free country. Wiser to fine people who engage in unhealthy lifestyles - anyway.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         No greater profession if astutely applied has more value than farming minds. But the farmer is worth his or her wages. And if the wage is not worth the risk, then don't bother making a stand, even symbolically. It is as nonsensical as the slave not leaving the plantation because he or she is afraid they may not get that evening's mutton. Good greif, stay, eat the mutton available and stop making idle threats. You just look silly.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         No guts no glory is the old cliche'
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Obviously I am not an english major.

         I did a Walk-in at Texas Wesleyan University, a small liberal arts school in Fort Worth, Texas. Wearing front-and-back poster board on which I listed my credentials (two Masters degrees and a Ph.D.), qualifications (two Fulbrights and trilingualism, for example), and the bottom line (salary &lt; $20,000) I engaged my two classes in a dialogue about the realities of adjunct professorships. Many were shocked at how little the Ph.D. actually bought. I was also able to attract a small crowd at our library with two education students trailing me with questions about the differences between teaching in public K-12 schools and universities. I also walked in to two full-time faculty offices, one of them belonging to the chair of her department, and asked them to take a moment to read my sign. I dont think anyone on campus had seen this sort of thing since the 1960s (if they were there). One person asked me, Are all of you doing this? but I was a lone ranger. Better a lone ranger than no ranger.
