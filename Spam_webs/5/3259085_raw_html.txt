         Unless youre one of those lucky people who lives in the middle of nowhere and never has to leave your house, chances are at some point youve had a mini-breakdown in a public place. It happens to us all! Normally its not anything earth-shattering that brings it on  perhaps youve had a particularly crappy day at work, or maybe youre feeling extra tired because you had one too many glasses of free wine at that happy hour thing last night and then stayed up until four in the morning worrying that youre going to spend the rest of your life alone? But sometimes it is actually a more serious/horrible thing, like your boyfriend tells you hes been cheating on you in the cereal aisle of a grocery store or the doctor calls you at the office and tells you to come in for some scary test.
        </p>
        <p>
         No matter what puts you in a fragile state, once youre there it doesnt take much to push you over the edge. One micromanage-y email from your boss or a funny look from a stranger on the street or the wrong song popping up on your iPod and the camels back is broken. It doesnt matter that youre standing in full view of 200 other commuters, your tears (or full-on wracking sobs) cannot be stopped. It feels terrible, but theres no shame in it! You just have to ride it out and do what you can to minimize the damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         First things first: When you find yourself on the brink of one of these emotional tornados, the best thing to do is the same thing you should do during an actual tornado: seek shelter. Never be shy about bolting from any kind of social situation if you feel tears welling up. Lie and say youve got an urgent phone call you have to take. Or, if youre in some kind of professional meeting, excuse yourself by saying you dont feel so well. I generally think its better for coworkers/clients to think youve got a stomach bug than to start guessing about what personal drama is making you cry. Wherever you are, dont worry about what people will think, just make something up and get out of there.
        </p>

         Obviously heading to the nearest bathroom is the tried and true solution, but depending on where you are this might not be an option, in which case, get creative. If youre at an office building or a hospital or other large corporate structure, go into the stairwell or duck into a supply closet. If youre at a store (and who among us does not want to cry while shopping for clothes), go into the dressing room. If youre in a restaurant or bar and the bathroom is taken, go out to the sidewalk and hide around the corner. If youre at work, crouch in a corner of your cubicle or under your desk  or run out to your car if you have to. Just get away from people as fast as possible so you can freak out in private.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, as youve probably experienced yourself at some point, there are many instances where hiding just isnt an option. If you cant get to a safe space in time, youll just have to ride out the storm in full view of everyone. At a certain point crying in public is a bit like throwing up, its going to happen whether you like it or not. So you can either fight it and make yourself even more miserable or you can go with it and politely do your best not to get it on anyone around you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here are the three basic steps to surviving full loss of tear duct control in public:
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1. Talk Yourself Down
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
         </strong>
         When you feel tears coming on and you have no escape path, its natural to panic. But in this case thats only going to make it worse. Youre going to have to channel your best supportive friend voice and walk yourself through it. (Inside your head; not out loud!) Start by reminding your brain that crying is natural. As they sang on Free to Be You and Me,
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Its all right to cry
          <br/>
          Crying gets the sad out of you
          <br/>
          Its all right to cry
          <br/>
          It might make you feel better
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         The sooner you can get it out of you, the faster youll be able to regain your dignity. So dont fight the tears, just let them roll out of you, and focus on breathing deeply. This will calm you down, and also its the best way to stop yourself from making those weird hee-hee-heeaving sounds that I find way more embarrassing than the actual tears themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you breathe in and out, you have to actively focus on not thinking about whats upset you to begin with. Instead of digging deeper into your pit of despair, go to your happy place, as those annoying self-help people always say. I dont care if you have to think about puppies licking your face, or put a cloyingly upbeat song on your iPod, or picture a deadly worm crawling into the ear of the person who has upset you, just do whatever it takes to distract yourself enough to stem the tide of tears. Now is not the time to deal with your emotions, thats better left for when you get home, where you can open your gaping wound back up and drink a glass of wine in the bathtub while you wallow in self pity and sob uncontrollablyyou know, like sensible people do.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2. Play Dumb
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, inside youre a hot mess and there is liquid shooting from your eyes, but theres no reason anyone else has to know. Managing your outward appearance requires some serious mental multitasking, but it will make it easier for you (it provides yet another distraction) and also make everyone around you a bit more comfortable and less likely to embarrass you by giving you an unsolicited hug. So basically, you need to turn on your inner theater geek and act like even though your eyes are leaking, everything is fine. The one exception here is if you are having a full-on Sobapalooza, in which case there is no way youre going to pull this off. Youll just have to do your best to hide your face in your hands while you weep and moan like a dying hyena. (Hey, sometimes you just have to go for broke!) But assuming youre having a run-of-the-mill woe-is-me moment, these are several ways to help yourself fake it til you make it.
        </p>
        <p>
         -Use props. Pretend like youre reading a magazine or listening to a sad song. Or youre all broken up because youre watching a wrenching drama on your tiny iPhone screen. Or youre on the phone. (You could actually call someone, but sometimes talking about why youre sad makes you even more teary, so do this at your own risk!) These things all make it look like theres a method to your madness, and people tend to ignore you more readily. Also, if youve just got a light teary eye, you can yawn a lot and rub your eyes in an effort to look like youre exhausted and/or have allergies.
        </p>
        <p>
         -Stone face. If you have nothing to read/watch/listen to, adopt the classic public space dead face. Lock your eyes onto an imaginary object in the middle distance, grit your teeth just a tiny bit to give the illusion of a tough attitude, and look as bored with life as you can manage. The less vulnerable you look, the better. Also, if you have sunglasses in your bag, put them on  even if it is the middle of the night. Better to look like a drunk badass than a soppy mess. If youre outside, start walking in any direction as fast and with as much purpose as you can. With any luck, youll eventually end up in front of a Starbucks and you can go in and use their bathroom. (It will probably be so gross that youll want to cry, but hey, too late, you already are!)
        </p>
        <p>
         -Keep interaction to a minimum. If a stranger (or even a well-meaning coworker) asks you whats wrong, keep your answer simple. Something like Eh, just a lousy day or I just have a terrible headache is perfect. Chances are theyre just asking to make sure you arent in some kind of real danger, and the last thing they want is a 20-minute long explanation of how your spouse is a manipulative narcissist. Also, there is a chance that the person who asks if youre okay is crazy or unpure of heart, and what you really dont need in your fragile state is to pour your heart out to them and then have them say, Shut up, you loser, or worse, Do you want to come back to my place? (No, you do not!) If some well-meaning person offers you a tissue, take it, say thanks, and then go back to being stoic.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3. Pull Yourself Together
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Eventually, hopefully after just a few minutes, your tears will subside.At that point, youll want to work on erasing all evidence of your breakdown. If youre one of those people who looks pretty when you cry (so unfair!), then youve got nothing to worry about  just dab your eyes and get on with your charmed life. But if youre like me, your eyes get all red and your face gets mottled-looking and you get congested and look like shit for at least half an hour after youre done crying. In that case, you should find the nearest bathroom ASAP, blow your nose, and splash some cold water on your face. Pressing a cold, wet paper towel against your eyes is soothing, and take some deep breaths too, because, though I have no scientific proof, I feel like doing that makes you look more sane and confident. Of course, sunglasses indoors can again be your friend. (Except if youre at work where its probably not worth looking like an idiot.) Stay in the bathroom (or wherever youve ducked into) as long as you need to regain your composure. If you find yourself feeling better because youve released your negative emotions, then by all means carry on with your plans for the day. But if youre still feeling raw or like another crying fit might be imminent, go right home and curl up in a ball if you can. If thats not an option, just go as easy as you can on yourself. Have some tea, call a friend, or spend a few hours watching cute cat videos online instead of working. You deserve it!
        </p>
        <p>
         No matter how severe your eye showers were, its very important that you not waste a second beating yourself up or feeling embarrassed about it. Sure, you lost it a little in front of some other people, but in the grand scheme of things its no big deal. Chances are youll never see any of them again, and even if you do they probably wont be judging you. I mean, youve seen people cry in public, and you didnt sit there thinking what an asshole, did you? No, you probably just felt bad for them for a second and then went back to thinking about your own depressing life. So, if its your day to be that guy who cries on the train, you just have to give yourself a little internal hug and move on. Of course, if youre really feeling pitiful or youre sad that the cute guy you just walked past saw you looking weepy, I suppose you can add the shame you feel to the list of things youll cry about later in the bathtub!
