       Identification.
      </i>
     </b>
     The name "Portugal" derives from a Roman or pre-Roman
      settlement called Portus Cale (the modern city of Porto) near the mouth of
      the Douro River. The Romans referred to this region as the province of
      Lusitania, and the prefix
     <i>
      Luso
     </i>
     (meaning "Portuguese") is still used in some contexts. In
      the ninth century, during the reconquest (7141140
     <small>
      C.E.
     </small>
     ), Christian forces dominated the area between the Minho River, which
      forms the border of modern Portugal in the north, and the Douro River, and
      the region became known as
     <i>
      Territorium Portucalense
     </i>
     . In 1095, the king of Castile and Leon granted Portucale (northern
      Portugal) to a Burgundian count. Despite the diversity of invading
      populations and distinct regional economies and ways of living, Portugal
      is a homogeneous nation with a single national cultural identity and no
      ethnolinguistic groups.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <i>
       Location and Geography.
      </i>
     </b>
     Continental Portugal at 35,516 square miles (91,986 square kilometers)
      occupies approximately a sixth of the Iberian peninsula. Since the
      majority of the population was rural until the 1960s, geography has been
      an important factor in cultural adaptations and worldview. The northwest
      (the province of Minho) is lush, green, densely populated, and the major
      source of emigrants. The northeast (the province of Trs-os-Montes)
      is more mountainous and is divided into a northern region (
     <i>
      terra fria
     </i>
     ) with long cold winters and a warmer region (
     <i>
      terra quente
     </i>
     ) to the south. The central part (including the provinces of Beira Alta,
      Beira Baixa, and Beira Litoral) varies from high and desolate mountain
      plateaus (the Serra da Estrela) to low coastal areas. The provinces of
      Ribatejo and Estemadura are low-lying regions near Lisbon and the Tagus
      River. Much industry is concentrated in this area. Southern Portugal,
      drier and more Mediterranean in climate, includes the provinces of the
      Alentejo and the Algarve. The Alentejo, an undulating plain with cork
      trees and wheat fields, was traditionally an important cash-crop area. The
      Algarve is semitropical with almond, fig, and citrus trees. It is also a
      region of tourism and fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Portuguese inhabit the Azores and Madeira in the Atlantic. As a result of
      colonial expansion and massive emigration in the nineteenth and twentieth

     In 1999, the population of continental and island Portugal was estimated
      at 9.9 million. The population increased until the 1960s, when it declined
      by more than 200,000 as a result of emigration to northern Europe. In the
      1970s, the population rose by more than a quarter million as
     <i>
      retornados
     </i>
     returned from Africa after decolonization. Portugal has been receiving
      immigrants, primarily from former overseas territories such as the Cape
      Verde Islands. This immigrant population, which has settled primarily in
      the greater Lisbon area, is estimated to be approximately 200,000.

     Portuguese is a Romance language with Latin roots, although some words

      under King Dinis (12791325). Dialects are found only in regions
      near the border with Spain and are disappearing. French was widely used by

       Symbolism.
      </i>
     </b>
     Many cultural symbols of national identity focus on the Age of Discovery
      and an imagined community that extends beyond the political frontiers of
      the nation. The national flag, adopted on 19 June 1911 during the First
      Portuguese Republic (19101926), includes an ancient astronomical
      device (the armillary sphere) used for maritime navigation and represents
      Portugal's role in global exploration. "
     <i>
      A Portuguesa
     </i>
     ," the national anthem, officially adopted in 1911, has as its
      central symbol a female figure modeled after "La
      Marseillaise" (the 
       Woman of Marseilles), the French symbol of republicanism. It expresses
      the nationalism that emerged in late nineteenth-century Anglo-Portuguese
      conflicts over African territory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nostalgia for the past and for the homeland is represented in the
      sentiments of
     <i>
      Sebastianismo
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      saudade
     </i>
     and in the lyrics of the
     <i>
      fado
     </i>
     . Sebastianismo is a messianic belief in the return of King Sebastian, who
      died in Morocco in 1578 or 1579. Sebastian was expected to drive out the
      Spaniards (who ruled from 1580 to 1640) and restore the nation to glory.
      Until recently, 1 December was a national holiday commemorating the
      overthrow of the Spaniards in 1640. Sebastianism is present in a worldview
      that expresses a hope that what one wants will happen and a feeling that
      it will never happen. Saudade refers to a melancholic and hopeful
      nostalgia for a homeland that is far away. The fado, derived from the
      Latin word for "fate," is a popular urban song form that
      generally expresses sadness, longing, and regret. The fado is thought to
      date back to the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century and to
      combine Moorish, African, and indigenous elements.

       Emergence of the Nation.
      </i>
     </b>
     Portugal has been inhabited since Paleolithic times. Various peoples
      settled in the region, though the modern Portuguese trace their descent to
      the Lusitanians, who spread over the peninsula in the third millennium
     <small>

     Roman armies invaded the peninsula in 212
     <small>
      B.C.E.
     </small>
     and established towns at the present-day sites of Braga, Porto, Beja, and
      Lisbon. Successive invasions of Germanic tribes in the fifth and sixth
      centuries
     <small>
      C.E.
     </small>
     and Moors in the eighth century
     <small>
      C.E.
     </small>
     added new elements to the population, particularly in the south. Portugal
      emerged as an independent kingdom in 1140 with its capital in the northern
      city of Guimares. Early statehood, the expulsion of the Moors, and
      the expulsion or conversion of the Jews laid the foundation for a unified
      national culture.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the fifteenth century, the Portuguese inaugurated the Age of Discovery
      and for three centuries built and expanded a seaborne empire. This
      imperial enterprise gave the nation a reputation for racial tolerance that
      is still invoked as the foundation of Portugal's comfort with
      cross-cultural diversity despite homogeneity at home. The loss of Brazil
      in 1822 and a series of economic and political crises led to a decline in
      the world position of the nation in the nineteenth century. The monarchy
      was eliminated in 1910 with the establishment of the First Portuguese
      Republic, which was replaced by the authoritarian dictatorship of
      Antnio Salazar in 1926. Salazar formed his New State (
     <i>
      Estado Novo
     </i>
     ) in 1932 on a corporatist political model and emphasized God, family, and
      work as the central values of the national culture. He limited access to
      higher education and, in emphasizing the Catholic faith, promoted
      humility, routine, and respect for authority as guiding principles of
      social life. He also celebrated the rural way of life by sponsoring a
      national competition in 1938 for the most Portuguese village.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Salazarist regime survived until 1974, when it was overthrown by
      military men frustrated by the hopelessness of the colonial wars in
      Africa. The African colonial system was dismantled after 1974. In the late
      1980s, Portugal became a member of the European Community, and in 1994,
      Lisbon served as the European cultural capital.

      <i>
       National Identity.
      </i>
     </b>
     The population of Portugal, the first unified national-state in Western
      Europe, has been extremely homogeneous for most of its history. A single
      religion and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and
      national unity. Portugal was the last western European nation to give up
      its colonies and overseas territories, turning over the administration of
      Macau to China as recently as 1999. Its colonial history has been
      fundamental to national identity, as has its geographic position at the
      margin of Europe looking out to the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      <i>
       Ethnic Relations.
      </i>
     </b>
     Portugal has retained linguistic and other cultural ties with former
      colonies, including Brazil. In 1996 the Community of Portuguese-speaking
      Countries was created. A recently-arrived population of immigrants, most
      from former colonies in Africa and Asia, has introduced some ethnic
      diversity, particularly in the Lisbon metropolitan area. These populations
      are residentially segregated in neighborhoods with poor housing and a
      general absence of public amenities. They are subjected to a form of
      subtle racism within a society that views itself as anti-racist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Portugal's gypsy population, estimated at about 100,000, offers
      another element of ethnic diversity. The gypsies live apart, and primarily
      in the south. They can often be found at rural markets selling clothing
      and handicrafts. Portugal also has small Protestant and Jewish
      communities, largely composed of foreigners.

    <h2>
     Urbanism, Architecture, and the Use of Space
    </h2>
    <p>
     In 1930, 80 percent of the population lived in rural villages, and thirty
      years later, 77 percent of the population was still rural. Since 1960,
      urbanization has been fueled by extensive internal migration from the
      countryside to the cities, but only 35.8 of the population was defined as
      urban in 1996. The two large cities of Lisbon and Porto are both on the
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hallmark of Portuguese architecture are
     <i>
      azulejos
     </i>
     , glazed ceramic tiles that cover the facades and interiors of churches,
      government buildings, and private homes. Azulejos were introduced by the
      Moors. Both geometric and representational patterns are used, the latter
      often depicting historical events or religious scenes. The azulejos style
      was taken to colonial Brazil and to India, and has been adopted by
      returned emigrants who have built new houses across the landscape of
      northern and central Portugal as social statements of their success
      abroad. Akin to azulejos are the mosaics used on the sidewalks of major
      walking avenues in Lisbon and Porto as well as in provincial towns. These
      avenues, lined with cafs and teahouses, are important public spaces
      where people stroll and converse. Stucco in various pastels is used on
      buildings, including the main government buildings in Lisbon. The other
      distinctive style of architecture is known as Manueline, after King Manuel
      I. It is a form of ornamentation that mixes elements of Christianity with
      ropes, shells, and other aquatic imagery, reflecting the nation's
      seafaring past.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vernacular buildings in rural areas use local materials. In the north,
      traditional peasant houses, often with two stories and a red tubular clay
      tile roof, were built with thick granite walls. Animals were kept on the
      ground floor, which also was used for storage. Many of these houses had
      verandas. All had a big hearth in the kitchen with an overhanging chimney
      used to smoke hams and sausage as well as to cook and heat. The kitchen is
      the center of private family space; these houses often also contain a
      parlor (
     <i>
      sala
     </i>
     ) for receiving guests. In the south one-story, whitewashed, flat-roofed
      houses with blue trim around the windows and doorways are common. This
      form of architecture evokes the Moorish past. These houses, which are
      built to keep out the summer heat, have huge chimneys and hearths. Since
      the 1970s, new housing and large apartment complexes have been built to
      accommodate the growing urban population.

     , a kale and potato soup generally flavored with a slice of
     <i>

      bread, especially in the northwest, is
     <i>
      broa
     </i>
     , a grainy corn bread with a thick crust. In Minho, the traditional wine
      is
     <i>
      vinho verde
     </i>
     , a young wine made from grapes that grow on arbors that often serve as
      property markers. In the northeastern region of Trs-os-Montes, fresh
      and cured pork, is used in a number of dishes. A stew of mixed meats and
      vegetables called
     <i>
      cozida a` portuguesa
     </i>
     originated in this region and has become a national dish. In central
      Portugal, cheeses are more common because of pasturing in the Serra da
      Estrela and fish (including octupus, squid, and eel) is abundant. In the
      south, the most popular soup is a form of
     <i>
      gazpacho
     </i>
     with bread and smoked pork. A pork and clam stew cooked in a
     <i>
      cataplana
     </i>
     (a tightly sealed steamer) is the regional dish of the Alentejo. Olive
      oil (

     ) is used throughout the country.

     <i>
      Bacalhau

      Portuguese began fishing off the coast of Newfoundland.
     <i>
      Pastis de bacalhau

     (codfish croquettes) are a popular appetizer. An important seasoning is
      cumin; equally important is
     <i>
      piri-piri

     , a hot red chili often used to season barbecued chicken. Cinnamon is a

     ).

     According to 1998 estimates agriculture constitutes 4 percent of the
      gross domestic product, industry 36 percent, and services 60 percent.
      Twelve percent of the population works in agriculture (compared with 40
      percent in 1960), 32 percent in industry (32 percent in 1960), and 56
      percent in services, commerce, and government (28 percent in 1960).
      Tourism is an important component of the service sector. Few families are
      wholly subsistence farmers, having relied traditionally on cash from the
      sale of surplus produce or from emigration of family members. Remittances
      from workers abroad are important to the economy, as are European Union
      transfers. Competition in the context of the European Union is changing

       Land Tenure and Property.
      </i>
     </b>
     Patterns of land tenure vary by region. In the Algarve, landholdings are
      small and are cultivated by owners, tenants, or sharecroppers. The
      Alentejo has traditionally been a region of low population density,
      latifundia that originated in the Roman estate system, and landless day
      laborers. Before 1974, approximately five hundred absentee landlords owned
      the bulk of the land. After 1974, the agrarian reform movement altered the
      system of land tenure in this region, although some of the early
      "revolutionary" expropriations have been restored to their
      original owners. The north has a much higher population density, land
      fragmentation,
     <i>
      minifndia
     </i>
     that originated with the system brought by the Germanic invaders of the
      fifth and sixth centuries, and subsistence farming. These peasants (
     <i>
      lavradores
     </i>
     ) own, rent, and/or sharecrop several fields scattered throughout a
      village as well as neighboring villages. Although not as numerous as in
      the south, there is a population of landless day laborers (
     <i>
      jornaleiros
     </i>
     ) in northern Portugal, many of whom are women. Jornaleiros provide
      supplemental labor to the peasant household. In the much less densely
      populated northeastern region, a form of communal property ownership 
       and communal farming survived into the twentieth century.

    <p>
     <b>
      <i>
       Commercial Activities.
      </i>
     </b>
     Commercial activities vary regionally. The peasants in the north
      cultivate corn (rye in the northeast), potatoes, wine grapes, and
      vegetables to sell at regional markets. Many also raise milk cattle, and
      the milk is sold to local cooperatives. Along the coastline, populations
      engage in fishing. Fish canning is an important export industry. The local
      economies in the north have been supplemented by centuries of emigration,
      and as a result, men have developed artisanal skills as masons and
      carpenters. Around Braga, Porto, and Guimares there is a population
      of worker-peasants employed in the textile industry. The people of the
      Algarve engage in agriculture, fishing, and tourism. Cash-crop agriculture
      (wheat, olives, cork) predominates in the Alentejo. In central continental
      Portugal, a variety of irrigated grains (wheat, corn, and rice) are
      cultivated on medium-sized family farms for commercial sale. The Azores
      are largely agricultural, with some islands depending primarily on dairy
      and meat production and others on a combination of cattle raising,
      whaling, fishing, and small-scale agriculture (sugar beets, tea, tobacco,
      and vegetables). Madeira relies on agriculture (wine, bananas, sugarcane),
      fishing, and whaling in addition to small-scale cottage industry and
      tourism. The embroidery industry is a major employer of female workers.

      shipbuilding, iron production, transport equipment, electrical machinery)
      and the bulk of the industrial working class are concentrated in the
      Lisbon-Setubal region in the south. In recent years, the construction

     At the end of World War II, Portugal had a small upper class, a small
      middle class, a small urban working class, and a mass of rural peasants.
      The upper class included leaders of industry, financiers, top military
      personnel, the Catholic episcopate, the large landholders of the Alentejo,
      some professionals, and some government officials. The middle class
      included smaller rural landowners, secondary-level military officers,
      small business operators and shopkeepers, civil servants, and
      schoolteachers. The lower class (
     <i>
      o povo
     </i>
     ) consisted of the urban and rural working poor. There was little social
      mobility, and a distinction was made between those who worked with their
      hands and those who did not. Social status was ascribed and sustained by
      class endogamy. Before 1974, the State was based on corporative bodies
      representing different interest groups (the military, the Church,
      landholders, workers' syndicates, etc.). In theory, the Corporate
      State channeled class interests but in practice these were often
      circumvented by personal contacts.

      Communist Party and class consciousness in the south after the 1974
      "revolution." Social stratification in the villages of the
      north was more fluid. Exposure to the very wealthy elites was also more
      limited. The 1976 constitution defined Portugal as a republic engaged in
      the formation of a classless society. While the Marxist tones of the
      constitution have largely been eradicated, Portugal is less socially rigid
      than in the past and education, which is more widely accessible as the
      country moves toward a service-oriented economy, is an avenue to social
      mobility. The middle class has grown and the peasant population has
      declined, but the distance separating the social, economic, and political
      elites from the bulk of the population remains.

     Portugal has moved from an authoritarian regime, to a provisional
      military government, to a parliamentary democracy. The president,
      representing the executive branch, is elected by universal suffrage for a
      five-year term and appoints the prime minister. In 1982, a constitutional
      revision put the military under civilian control, with the president as
      the commander in chief. A unicameral Assembly of the Republic, with two
      hundred thirty members elected by universal suffrage for four-year terms,
      constitutes the legislative branch. Center-right leadership predominated
      between 1985 and 1995 and the Socialist Party assumed leadership in 1995.

     Before 1974 local people were not engaged with the political process but
      since then public debate and voting have both increased dramatically. In
      some rural communities, particularly in the south, a system of patronage
      prevailed, but this also changed after the 1974 revolution. Cultural

     The three military branches are the Army, Navy, and the Air Force. In
      1997 military expenditures were 2.6 percent of the GDP. The military age
      is 20. The Portuguese military was heavily involved in the Colonial Wars
      in Africa and by 1974, 80 percent of Portugal's military forces
      were committed to that region. Military service was extended to as long as
      four years during the 1960s, a phenomenon that resulted in a sharp
      increase in clandestine emigration to France during that decade. The
      military, under the title of the Armed Forces Movement (Movimento das

     Prior to the twentieth century, the Roman Catholic Church and other
      charitable institutions such as the Santa Casa de Misericrdia were
      the primary mechanisms of social welfare in Portugal. During the Salazar
      regime, a system of Casas do Povo were established in local places,
      primarily to regulate the Corporate State, but also to take care of
      individual needs. Their impact was limited. State-operated systems of
      welfare did not emerge until the 1960s and they have improved with the
      growth of parliamentary democracy and greater economic stability and
      prosperity. Even so, in the early 1990s welfare benefits, financed through
      employee and employer contributions, were low by comparison with other
      European nations. Welfare programs include benefits for the ill and
      disabled, old-age pensions, maternity leaves, and small family allowances.
      After 1975 Portugal introduced a national health care system that paid all
      medical and pharmaceutical expenses.

     The Church is the major nongovernmental association that organizes social

      confraternities (
     <i>
      confrarias

      confraternities were important mutual aid societies, sources of loans and

      has also been an important increase in folkloric dance groups (
     <i>
      ranchos

      traditions. 
       These ranchos are under the auspices of the national Federation for
      Portuguese Folklore. Portuguese people participate in a variety of other
      urban and national associations, many of them professionally based.
      Recently new associations for particular social groups, for example the

     Labor force statistics frequently underestimate the participation of
      women, particularly in the rural economy of the north. Some
      anthropologists view these activities as the basis of the significant
      economic and political power of peasant women. Middle- and upper-class
      women were at one time restricted to the domestic sphere, but this has
      changed as women have received advanced education and professional
      training, and full legal equality. Factors such as an interventionist
      state, low wages, flexibility in the allocation of labor resources of
      family members, a rigid social structure, and incipient economic and
      technological development explain the low rate of labor market segregation
      by gender.

    <p>
     Since the 1960s, women have outpaced men in higher education, although
      class factors are ultimately more important in shaping these trends.
      Portugal has had one woman serve as president. Local attitudes are more
      conservative, and women have been slower to win political positions in
      municipal elections.

    <p>
     Women still perform the major domestic chores, although men are involved

     The marriage rate rose in the twentieth century. People generally marry
      later in the north than in the south, though the differences are
      disappearing. In the south, consensual unions have been common, and the
      north has had high rates of permanent spinsterhood. Although it has
      declined since 1930, illegitimacy was high in rural northern Portugal and
      remains high. Marriage has generally been class endogamous, and there is a
      tendency for villages to be endogamous.

     Households in the north tend to be complex, many of them composed of a
      three-generation stem family. Some villagers in the northeast follow a
      custom of natalocal residence for many years after marriage. In the south,
      households are simpler, generally composed of a nuclear family.
      Obligations between friends are sometimes felt to be more important than
      those between kin. Headship of the household is held jointly by a married
      couple, who in the rural north are referred to as
     <i>
      o patro
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      a patroa

       Inheritance.

     The Civil Code of 1867 called for partible inheritance, but parents can
      dispose freely of a third share (
     <i>
      tero
     </i>
     ) of their property, and women have the right to receive and bestow
      property. Among the peasants of the north, where inheritance is generally
      postmortem, parents use the promise of the tero as a form of old age
      security by marrying a child into the household. At their death, that
      child becomes the owner of the house (
     <i>
      casa
     </i>
     ); the rest of the property is divided equally among all heirs.
     <i>
      Partilhas
     </i>
     can cause friction between siblings since land is variable in quality.
      Some peasants hold land under long-term lease agreements that
      traditionally was passed on in one piece to one heir. The 1867 Civil Code
      eliminated the system of entailed estates (
     <i>
      vnculos
     </i>
     ) that made it possible for wealthier classes to pass on property to a
      single heir, usually by male primogeniture. Wealthier landowners have been
      able to keep property intact by having one heir buy out the siblings.

     Kinship is reckoned bilaterally, but the structure of domestic groups and
      the kinship links that are emphasized vary by region and social class. In

      In this region, there is a preference for uxorilocality and
      uxorivicinality, both of which can be linked to male emigration. Spiritual

      been a decline in the number of clergy. Religiosity is generally weaker in

      the message that a neighbor (

     ) has passed away. In some areas, the gates and doors of the dead
      person's house are opened to allow anyone to enter and relatives
      begin to wail around a body prepared for viewing. Burial is in local
      cemeteries, and family graves are well tended. Each village has several
      burial societies (confrarias). All Saints Day is an occasion for reverence
      for those who have departed. Mourning is signified by the wearing of
      black; a widow generally will wear black for the rest of her life, while
      other kin remain in mourning for varying lengths of time. Portugal has
      various cults of death. Such beliefs are not confined to rural areas; in

      causes of death are malignant neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory and
      respiratory systems, and death from injuries and poisons. Portugal has a
      low suicide rate but high motor accident fatalities. Folk medical
      practices are still prevalent in some parts. Curers use a combination of

      the twentieth century with the short stories of rural life by Manuel
      Torga, the novels of Aquilino Ribeiro, and epic tales such as Ferreira de
      Castro's
     <i>
      Emigrantes
     </i>
     . Perhaps the greatest Portuguese modernist is Fernando Pessoa. Modernism
      attacked the values of the middle classes of the liberal period.
      Contemporary realists include Lobo Antunes and Jos Saramago, who won
      the Nobel Prize in 1998.

     The greatest art forms are architecture and ceramics. Painting has not
      been particularly important. Folk arts are well developed, and
      craftspeople are found throughout the country. Rugs made in Arraiolas are
      well-known internationally. Women in the north and the island of Madeira
      produce embroidered goods that are sold to tourists. Pottery varies in
      style according to geographic region. Artistic expression is also evident
      in the items produced for decorating the floats carried in religious
      processions and in the filigree jewelry made in the Porto region, which
      also is worn at festivals.

     The fado is one of the most important performing traditions.

     (folkloric dance groups) are being revived, supported by the tourist
      industry. Dancers dress in traditional regional costumes and perform
      dances that have historical and regional origins. Bull-fighting is also an
      important performance art.

    <p>
     Since 1974, the social sciences have emerged strongly, with programs in
      most universities. Of importance are the Institute of Social Sciences of
      the University of Lisbon and the Instituto Superior de Cincias
      Sociais in Lisbon. Portugal publishes two major journals of social
      science.

       Hey John,
       <br/>
       <br/>
       read this, especially the demographic section, which clearly says, that the gypsy population of Portugal is 100.000, and we're not talking about the 'others' yet.
       <br/>
       8-10 percent of population of Hungary means the same quantity, but we're working on it mate!!!

       Hi There,
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am a Proto-Turkish researchist and i would like to inform you that the name of Portugal-ia comes from completely different root: In Proto-Turkish, Port means harbour.UG means water. AL/EL means people and IA means Land. So basically it means "The Land of People of Water. 13000 years ago Proto-Turks went to today's Portugal and settled down there bringing their own language and alphabet

       They don't wear much tradional clothing nowadays but in rural are and traditional festivities they do sometimes. It's more a matter of national pride and cultural identity, it also varies a bit from region to region but is overall similar. And indeed it would be good to add.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As for the proto-turk theory...I am sorry but that's just a coincidence. The most proto-turkish people that Portugal got was the Alans, and they were absorbed into the local population abandoning their language in favor of Vulgar Latin of the region, intermarrying and converting to Arian Chritianity, the modern day name came from the Latin as in above and the language came from a dialect of galician plus latin and other influences.

       Hi, My name is Hunter. I am a student from bondurant, Iowa in the Bondurant middle school. I am currently doing a project for my geography class on the country of Portugal! I was hoping you might be able to give me some information about this country.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was curious to know more about what it is like there and about more human interactions. I have been having trouble finding information about human interactions: occupations, Architecture, games, clothing adaptions to habitat, government, and religons. If there is anything else that you feel I should know about your country please feel free to tell as much as possible. Thank you for your help with my project! (:
       <br/>

       Sincerely,
