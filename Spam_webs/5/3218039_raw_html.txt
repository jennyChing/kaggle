            What Healthcare Needs to Prepare for in the New Year

          <p>
           2014 is almost here and with a new year comes changes. This New Year in particular is going to bring a lot of changes and new regulations to the healthcare industry. A few of these changes and how to handle them include:
          </p>
          <h4>
           <a href="http://www.smartloca.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ny.png">
            <img alt="What Healthcare Needs to Prepare for in the New Year" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90" height="950" src="http://wp.smartloca.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ny.png" width="734"/>
           </a>
          </h4>
          <h4>
          </h4>
          <h4>
           Consumer Empowerment
          </h4>
          <p>
           In the new terrain that healthcare is moving to, people will have much more control over how they access their options. Mobile apps and availability is going to be the key for healthcare brands to reach the most consumers possible. Those that can come up with creative and personally engaging ways to connect with patients will definitely have an extreme leg-up on the competition.
          </p>
          <h4>
           The war between hospitals and insurance companies is over.
          </h4>
          <p>
           They have now merged to create a more streamlined business on both ends. It is very important that marketers or marketing teams get people on board and communicate to patients how this new partnership will benefit them.
          </p>
          <h4>
           The Affordable Care Act  like it or not, Obamacare will be implemented in 2014.
          </h4>
          <p>
           As the bottom lines of every healthcare related business are working hard and quickly to make their organizations compliable with the new law, marketers need to find a way for healthcare organizations to communicate with patients as to how this new law will affect their healthcare.
          </p>
          <h4>
           Retail healthcare is popping up everywhere.
          </h4>
          <p>
           Pharmacy type retailers as well as some grocery stores, are offering in store clinics, vaccinations and kiosks, in addition to their pharmacy services, all with no appointment and often at a cheaper price. This is going to be a big deal for small clinics that offer these types of services.
          </p>
          <h4>
           Prevention and awareness of chronic illnesses is becoming more focused upon.
          </h4>
          <p>
           The effort to do so is to help reduce chronic illnesses and the cost of the healthcare incurred by those illnesses. Marketers or marketing teams are joining forces with wellness companies and their products to educate and promote awareness in consumers, to sell the preventative products and to bring loyalty to both of the companies.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we ring in 2014, the healthcare industry will also be ringing in some very big changes. The transition should be pretty flawless if you have a great, fore-thinking and creative marketer or marketing team and you insure your entire staff is on the same page as far as understanding the new law and are able to explain to patients clearly, what has changed and how that affects them.

          <h3>
           The common bugs on websites.
          </h3>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Website does not work correctly
           </li>
           <li>
            Duplicate content
           </li>
           <li>
            Too many domains competing for search engine rank
           </li>
           <li>
            Poor structure of the sites URL
           </li>
           <li>
            Meta descriptions and title tags are incorrect or missing
           </li>
           <li>
            Not enough information provided
           </li>
           <li>
            If a page has a video on it, search engines cannot recognize the content in the video in order to bring it up, so it is crucial that when posting a video you include text that goes with it.
           </li>
           <li>
            The content contains not enough or no keywords.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
           Another reason some of these facilities are so successful?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Their internal communication is solid. Only when a team is united, will success be attainable. Some important things a team should do to help achieve success not only digitally but also within the facility would be:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Everyone agreeing on the facilities purpose, culture, short and long term goals.
           </li>
           <li>
            Finding a way to help physicians get to know other physicians, to encourage internal referrals of patients.
           </li>
           <li>
            Using electronic medical records helps facilities to better keep track of information, billing and finances while helping to keeping workflow smooth and at a good pace.
           </li>
           <li>
            Departments should always share their successes with each other. This will encourage each department to stay motivated to be successful.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Patients dont want to come to a facility and fill out a pile of registration forms or take time out of their day to call a facility, taking the chance of being put on hold. They want to do this from their phone, laptop, PC or tablet, from where ever they are. Facilities that understand this demand have features on their website to assist with:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Scheduling appointments
           </li>
           <li>
            Giving explanations of options for treatments
           </li>
           <li>
            Giving patients access to online bill pay
           </li>
           <li>
            Patient forms either by printing or by filling them out directly on the site
           </li>
           <li>
            Questions regarding insurance and provide a comprehensive list of those that are accepted.
           </li>
           <li>
            Giving the patient the ability to research something they may have been told to do while in the clinic and cannot remember and can then, avoid a call to the facility
           </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
           Successful websites should include:
          </h3>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Relevant patient education with text, images, and videos
           </li>
           <li>
            Content should outline causes, risks, and symptoms
           </li>
           <li>
            Treatment options.
           </li>
           <li>
            SEO words, as people looking for it will look for this information by searching for it in a web browser.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The world is becoming digitized and facilities that understand and embrace that will be very successful at how they market their brand online.

          <h4>
           <b>
            1. Poor Content
           </b>
          </h4>
          <p>
           Putting incomplete or information that is just plain uninteresting on your social media sites or website is the best way to turn patients off. If your posts, no matter on what site, are unprofessional, grammatically incorrect, or just too messy or difficult to understand, this can actually ruin a practices standing in their community. Written information, when done well, can generate a lot of word of mouth referrals, but it must be structured professionally with the patient in mind.
          </p>
          <h4>
           <b>
            2. Not Knowing the Difference Between Marketing and Advertising
           </b>
          </h4>
          <p>
           Marketing is more strategy, while advertisement is more the actual work done to achieve the marketing goals. Once you understand the difference between these two terms, you will be able to be much more successful at getting your message out. If you research and follow the six fundamentals of marketing in healthcare you should see success. These fundamentals, for your success are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Branding
           </li>
           <li>
            External, Internal and Internet marketing
           </li>
           <li>
            Professional referral marketing
           </li>
           <li>
            Public relations
           </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
           <b>
            3. Being too aggressive
           </b>
          </h4>
          <p>
           Forcing an idea or overly lecturing a patient happens too often in marketing and is one of the best ways to fail. Patients come to healthcare facilities to get help with their conditions and to feel cared for, not to be lectured and bombarded with information. This route may be perceived very negatively by patients. A practice should concentrate less on promotional marketing, instead engaging in a campaign geared toward gentle patient education.
          </p>
          <h4>
           <b>
            4. Not tracking the success of your different marketing platforms
           </b>
          </h4>
          <p>
           Implementing a way for staff to track what platform your new patient heard about you at their first call. This will show you what platforms are beneficial and which ones you probably dont need. It is recommended that these statistics be reviewed at least quarterly.
          </p>
          <h4>
           <b>
            5. Not having an anchor
           </b>
          </h4>
          <p>
           When a healthcare provider or practices only plan is to bring in more patients, do they want to bring in patients that are loyal to their practice? Do they want to build relationships with other healthcare professionals that may refer patients to them for services when necessary? If patients come to your practice and have a good experience from the time they walk in until the time they leave, they are going to give you excellent word of mouth referrals and that has been proven to be the best and cheapest way to advertise.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hopefully, by learning about some very typical mistakes and seeing how they can be avoided, your attempt at medical marketing will be a success.

            Why You Should Respond to Your Practices Online Reviews

         <div class="entry-content clearfix">
          <p>
           According to a study by Pew Internet Research, about
           <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Commentary/2011/November/Pew-Internet-Health.aspx">
            72% of internet users
           </a>
           searched online for health related information and about 30% of the users relied on online reviews of health care services. This means one thing  a lot of people now rely on the internet for information.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the increase in use of the internet and the World Wide Web as a source of information by most consumers, a new challenge for business owners has arisen  that of undesirable online reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lack of control over online reviews by business owners is what has made them a challenge. As a physician, you have zero control over what people say about your medical practice and services. Clients, both satisfied and dissatisfied, can freely post reviews of your practice on forums, social media sites, and other review sites.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a physician, online reviews should not keep you bothered; instead, try to make use of the reviews (both positive and negative) to gauge the services of your practice.
          </p>
          <h5>
           How you can use online reviews to improve your medical practice
          </h5>
          <p>
           Always monitor the internet for reviews about your practice. You can simply conduct a Google search of your business name or visit websites specializing in medical practice reviews. Also, you can monitor social mentions on Facebook, twitter, Google+, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Once you see a review of your practice, respond to it promptly. When responding, do not be defensive; just be as open-minded as possible. After you respond to the reviews, the next step should be to use the reviews to improve your practice.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can handle the reviews personally, or have a member of staff committed to responding to online reviews.
          </p>
          <h5>
           Respond Vs. Ignore
          </h5>
          <p>
           For your brand to succeed in the internet era, you have no option but handle online reviews whether positive or negative.
          </p>
          <p>
           Failure to respond to negative reviews will make online users deem the review as a fact. A response to your business review helps you clear the air about an issue. If, according to a review, a patient was dissatisfied with your service, reassure them of your commitment to satisfying them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember, the response is not for the review writer only, but for the entire internet community who will have access to the review. You are not responding to an individual, but to the whole online world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Responding to a review gives you a nice platform to clear cases of misinformation. Since more and more patients are relying on the internet for information, clearing any misinformation goes a long way towards improving your practices image in the eyes of potential clients.
          </p>
          <p>
           In case of completely wrong and inflammatory comments and reviews, contact the review site for a resolution. Although drawing into public arguments with your past patients, can lead to increased publicity and exposure, it is not good for your practice.

           LinkedIn, a social networking site for professionals, is one of the best places to generate business leads for your medical practice business. You generate the leads by building valuable relationships with new and existing patients. With a LinkedIn company page, you are able to strengthen existing patient relationships and generate valuable leads by sharing valuable content through status updates.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although maintaining your personal LinkedIn page is necessary, your medical practice business ought to have its own company page. Besides enhancing business relationships with new and existing patients, a company page brings out the professionalism in you.
          </p>
          <h3>
           <b>
            How to Create a New LinkedIn Company Page
           </b>
          </h3>
          <p>
           To create a LinkedIn company page for your medical practice, visit
           <a href="http://marketing.linkedin.com/company-pages/">
            http://marketing.linkedin.com/company-pages/
           </a>
           and click on the Get Started button. This should take you to a page where you can add your company info. Here, fill in the simple sign up form.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the sign up form, fill in your company name and email address. You must have a company email address bearing your own domain name, e.g. name@company.com (you cant sign up using your hotmail, Gmail, yahoo mail domains etc).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Tip
           </strong>
           : If you dont have a private email domain name, consider creating a group.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Note
           </strong>
           : A LinkedIn group is not as effective and professional as a company page.
          </p>
          <p>
           After filling in the details, click on the checkbox to verify that you are the official representative of the company and are authorized to act on its behalf. After that, click on the Continue button. This will make a LinkedIn company page for your medical practice business.
          </p>
          <p>
           After the company page is up, you need to do the following to make it more effective:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            On the About section (found at the bottom of the home page), write a compelling summary about your medical practice business. Remember, it is about your business, not you.
           </li>
           <li>
            On the products and services tab, share the services your medical practice business offers. This is perfect place to sell/market your medical services. Remember to list your most important service first.
           </li>
           <li>
            Include a professional photo that captures attention. The photo should be as contextual as possible. Since the about section is at the bottom of the page, include a simple, but catchy message on the cover photo.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you plan to recruit, include a careers page to your LinkedIn company page (to add this page, you have to pay). The careers page will help you get the right professionals for your business needs.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you have any employees (who have LinkedIn profiles), tell them to connect to your company page.
           </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
           To make you page appear useful, regularly post useful and meaningful content  content that your followers will read and recommend. The content should be as engaging as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           The company page shouldnt be a place to show off your medical expertise. Use a language and terms your potential patients will understand. Remember, your patients are not doctors, but regular people working in other fields.
          </p>
          <p>
           Your patients should get value from the updates you post on the page. Go ahead and give free health tips to your followers. This will help you attract more and more followers. The more followers you garner, the higher the chances of increasing your patient base.

           With the emergence of social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, etc, building closer relationships with your patients is now as easy as ABC.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a doctor, Facebook is one of the best social networks where you can create personal relationships with your patients. Besides your personal Facebook page, you need a business page. A Facebook business page is able to sell your professional image more than a personal page can. Your Facebook business page provides a combination of professionalism and personal relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unlike a website, a Facebook page lets your patients feel closer to you than ever before. This is very important for your business success.

           Acquiring patients is becoming more and more difficult as consumers become savvier. Paying for advertising is extremely competitive, very expensive, low producing, or all three! Getting your medical clinics website ranked in a search engine can take months with an expensive, risky contractor who may not even produce.
          </p>
          <p>
           But following this one easy step will not only get your practice in front of patients for free, the patients who will see your advertisement are desperate to give you their business. As an added bonus this also passively increases your websites ranking in search engines, which allows more patients to find your practice at no extra cost.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.smartloca.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/24.jpg">
            <img alt="24" class="size-medium wp-image-18 aligncenter" height="300" src="http://wp.smartloca.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/24-300x300.jpg" width="300"/>

          </p>
          <p>
           Submitting your business to online business directories may not seem like such a big deal, but consider this; there are literally thousands of directories available  thats thousands of potential advertisements for your practice at absolutely zero cost to you. If you would pay to be in your local phone book, why wouldnt you want the online equivalent for no charge? Business directories do exactly the same thing, except they make it convenient and easy for users to search for services they need.
          </p>
          <p>
           These directories are doing all of the hard work of getting clients searching through their listings. These directories are sending thousands of people in your area who are looking for a service. They are positioning people who are desperately searching for what you provide. In other words, when people see that your office is listed in their area, they are more likely to follow through and make an appointment, because the reason they even looked at your listing is to fix some problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           But even if a directory doesnt send a single patient your waywhich is extremely unlikelyit is still passively increasing the search engine ranking of your website. When you list your services, youre also able to list one or two links back to your service website for potential patients to browse. With every link you post on a website that has been indexed by a search engine, like Google, you are increasing the weight of your website. It works like this;
          </p>
          <p>
           You create a website and have it indexed by a search engine like Google.
           <br/>
           Google sends a spider robot to collect your URL, as well as any links on your website
           <br/>
           Every time a spider crawls a website, it remembers all the links it saw on that website
           <br/>
           Every time a spider sees your link on another website, it likes your website a little bit more
           <br/>
           If you have your practice on thousands of directories, Google likes your website a thousand times more
           <br/>
           Now you show up higher in the search engine results when consumers search for your website
          </p>
          <p>
           You really cant afford not to start listing your practice right away.
