           Agency  Backtracks on Attempt to Exclude Wolf Experts From Review of Delisting Proposal
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          WASHINGTON The U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service today announced that it will put on hold the  scientific peer review of its proposal to remove protections for gray wolves  across the country while it reviews its own actions leading to the  disqualification of three scientists from the review panel.
         </p>
         <p>
          Last week it was revealed  that three scientists were excluded from the peer review because they signed a
          <a href="/campaigns/gray_wolves/pdfs/scientists_letter_on_delisting_rule.pdf">
           letter
          </a>
          calling into question some of the science behind the proposal to delist the  gray wolf. While the Service initially claimed that it had not asked for the  three scientists to be removed, emails between the contractor supervising the  peer review process and the scientists themselves confirmed that the Service  had in fact done exactly that.
         </p>
         <p>
          Were glad to see the Fish and Wildlife Service  admit this mistake and hope this means there will be a true independent review  of this deeply flawed proposal to remove protections for gray wolves, said  Brett Hartl, endangered species policy director with the Center for Biological  Diversity. Unfortunately, this is but one example of how the Fish and Wildlife  Service has been twisting the scientific process to get the desired political  result of no more protections for wolves.
         </p>
         <p>
          Peer review, a step required  by the Endangered Species Act, is critical in ensuring that federal protections  are not lifted before a species is fully recovered. In the case of the wolves,  the Fish and Wildlife Service is contracting with a private company to conduct  the peer review. Recognizing their scientific expertise, the private contractor  hired for the review contacted several of the signers to the letter to  participate in the review, including Dr. John Vucetich, Dr. Robert Wayne and  Dr. Roland Kays. As part of its  contract, the outside contractor was required to submit the
          <em>
           rsum
          </em>
          s  of each peer reviewer to the Service with the names redacted. However, because  each of these scientists has published hundreds of articles, it was easy for  the Service to deduce who the contractor had selected. The Service then sent  the contractor a copy of the letter asking that any signers be removed.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Service should take a moment to reflect on why  it felt it was necessary to go to such lengths to control the peer review  process of this proposal, said Hartl. Perhaps its because the decision to  delist the gray wolf is based on politics, not solely on the best available  science.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is the first time the Fish and Wildlife Service  has imposed
          <a href="/campaigns/gray_wolves/pdfs/Wolf_Delisting_RFP_Statement_of_Work.pdf">
           restrictions
          </a>
          at the outset for whether scientists could be involved in peer review based on  what it termed an affiliation with an advocacy position. In contrast, during  the review of the 2012 proposal to designate critical habitat for the northern  spotted owl, the agency invited 40 scientists to participate, a number of whom  had spoken out for stronger protections for the owl, to review the proposal and  none were preemptively disqualified from the review. In what was a clear  attempt to limit meaningful scientific comment, the peer review process was put  in jeopardy.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Service also appears to have circumvented proper  scientific channels in concluding that there are two different wolf species in  the United States, the gray wolf (
          <i>
           Canis  lupus
          </i>
          ) and the eastern wolf (
          <i>
           Canis  lycaon
          </i>
          ), a determination that formed a primary basis for removing  protections. Rather than attempting to publish their taxonomic findings in an independent,  outside journal subject to normal peer review processes, the Service revived
          <i>
           North American Fauna
          </i>
          , an internal agency  publication that had been dormant for more than 20 years, just to publish this  one taxonomic proposal on wolves.
         </p>
         <p>
          The letter from the scientists and
          <a href="/campaigns/gray_wolves/pdfs/ASM-2013-Wolf-Delisting-letter.pdf">
           another
          </a>
          from the American Society of Mammalogists raised a number of scientific  questions about the agencys proposal to remove protections for wolves, which  today survive in just 5 percent of their historic range in the lower 48. In  particular, they questioned how wolves could be considered recovered when the  species is absent from significant portions its range, and a determination by  the Service that there are two species of wolves in the United States, the gray  wolf (
          <i>
           Canis lupus
          </i>
          ) and the eastern  wolf (
          <i>
           Canis lycaon
          </i>
          ). These are  important questions that should be thoroughly vetted.

           Background  on Scientists Excluded from Review:
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          The following scientists were excluded based on the  Services new restrictions on peer reviewers:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Dr. John  Vucetich of Michigan Technological University. Vucetich has been studying the  wolves of Isle Royale National Park for the past 20 years and is one of  nations leading wolf researchers. Vucetich was a member of the Mexican wolf  recovery team and in 2011 participated as a peer reviewer of the Services  decision to drop federal protections for the gray wolf in Wyoming.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Dr. Robert Wayne  of the University of California, Los Angeles. Wayne is a leading wildlife  geneticist and has studied the evolutionary and ecological relationship between  wolves and other canine species in the United States and around the world.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Dr. Roland Kays  of North Carolina State University. Kays is a zoologist whose research focuses  on the ecology and conservation of mammals. Kays research has focused on the  genetic relationship and evolution of wolves and coyotes in North America.
