          mericans are a fearful bunch. Our swagger is unmatched when it comes to bragging about our nations wealth and power, but when it comes down to a more personal level, were afraid ofof what?
         </p>
         <p>
          In 1995 and 1996, my wife Claire and I rode a tandem bicycle 14,000 miles around America. We wanted to experience an adventure andto discover what our fellow Americans were really like. During our travels we met hundreds of caring, sharing people who made us proud to be Americans.
         </p>
         <p>
          We also discovered that many of them are fearful and sometimes, because of that fear, they dislike each other. Fear seems to breed antipathy, even hate.
         </p>
         <p>
          People thought we were either brave or stupid to try to undertake such a journey. We figured it was a little of both  but it was our choice. As Americans we are blessed to have the freedom to do with our lives as we please. After nearly forty thousand miles of pedaling around the world, weve learned that many others are not so fortunate. They do not have the freedom to even learn about their own culture, let alone travel the world and learn about other lifestyles.
         </p>
         <p>
          Asthousands of milespassed under our wheels, we were driven by our increasingly powerful muscles and sharper, more questioning minds and we wondered why so many Americans seemed so afraid. What was causing their fear?
         </p>
         <p>
          In rural Washington state we passed a sign on a driveway that said, WARNING: Dont Come Around Here After Dark, Or Youll Be Found Here In The Morning. We realized that locking ones door is not necessarily being fearful, just prudent.But what was it that wouldmotivate someone to threaten everyone passing his house?
         </p>
         <p>
          Aretired fighter pilot in Texas, an Hispanic trucker in Nevada, a pickup-driving cowboy in Montana, a Cajun sheriffs deputy along with many other folks of all colors with their ownpolitical and religious persuasions  all asked us: What do you carry for protection?
         </p>
         <p>
          We settled on a vague answer: We dont talk about that.Our response seemed to satisfy most everyoneexcept the Cajun deputy sheriff who insisted I take his heavy-duty pepper spray.
         </p>
         <p>
          We were invited for dinner and a bed by a wonderful couple we metin Indiana. Theywere curiousas towhy we would do such a dangerous thing as riding a bicycle around America.
          <a href="http://justoneopinion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/couple-afraid.jpg">
           <img alt="Our hosts - a couple afraid" class="left size-medium wp-image-1847" height="300" src="http://justoneopinion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/couple-afraid-225x300.jpg" title="couple-afraid" width="225"/>

          They were followers of a preacher who told them Armageddon would come in the year 2000. They owned weapons and their house had bars on the windows and several locks on the doors. They couldnt explain to us how any of this would help them during the great conflagration that we are told will come with Armageddon.
         </p>
         <p>
          I respect others religious beliefs as long as they respect my lack thereof. But I found it to be strange that their god did not give them comfort, but fear. We explained tothem that we had no fear because we were living our dream; if something were to happen to us, we would have fulfilled our lives. I hope our positive attitude about the dangers of our trip made them question their own excessive fears.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mind you, none of these people had everbeen attacked by anyone or had even personally knownsomeone who had been attacked  but they stillfelt the need for protection. This wasyears before 9/11; our government had not yet created withinus the constant fear of terrorists and violent crimes were actually declining throughout most of the country.

           <img alt="A lady shooting a .45 pistol" class="right size-full wp-image-1848" height="300" src="http://justoneopinion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/lady-shooting.jpg" title="A lady shooting a .45 pistol" width="248"/>
          </a>
         </p>
         <p>
          I can only conclude that we Americans are fearful because it is in someones interest to keep us that way. Gun and ammunition manufacturers certainly gain, as do locksmiths and home security companies. But what about psychologists and ministers? And Hollywood movies and TV shows?
         </p>
         <p>
          Im not suggesting that these particular entities,or anyother businesses or individuals, are engaged in a conspiracy to make us all fearful. But where are the voices speaking out for the opposing viewpoint, that we really have very little to fear in this country?
         </p>
         <p>
          The obvious answer is that theres noprofit in helping Americans tofeel secure, but plenty ofmoney to be made by making us afraid.
         </p>
         <p>
          The big downside is this: Fear breeds a distrust for those who are not like us, and that fact could eventually lead to the breakdown of our cohesiveness as a nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Isnt that exactly what our enemies want  forAmericans to be afraid? Could our fearfulness really be our worst enemy?

            What a great tale. How cool that you and your lady could have the energy, money and time to  travel by bycicle across America. I wonder how you did it! I looked at your story on your web pages and it looks very good. Why dont you write a book or may be you already have? I see you wrote that book Nomber 44 but that isnt about your trip is it? Anyway I think you and your Claire must be really great people to do such a thing. How did you get so many people to talk to you and share their home with you? Its to bad that they believe in the end of the World is coming and are fearful. I see the bycicles in the picture with the lady with the gun, is that your wife? It doesnt look like her on the other web pages, so I guess not, but it looks like she could do a lot of damage with that gun. I think I would want to carry one with me if I was out by myself or just with my wife on the road alone. You guys are really brave I think. I guess I must be one of those people who is afraid like you said.

            It would, I think, be perhaps more interesting to see if there is a correlation between religious faith and fearfulness.  Its been my limited observation that those of us without religious faith are less afraid of dying than are our religious brethern.

            Nice story Bob.  Unfortunately, I believe the fear that many Americans feel is simply a reaction to the reality that surrounds usa reality that is all too visible in a world that inundates us with media images of the horrors and random acts of violence that are happening all over America.  We didnt get bombarded in the same way years ago when you and Claire made your marvelous trip, but it was still there on the evening news every day.  The current spate of senseless killings that range from groups of policemen to rooms full of immigrants sends the message to everyone that they need to be prepared, because it can happen to anyone at any time.  All of that makes it obvious to me why people who are less adventurous than you and Claire would believe that you are vulnerable on a bicycle trip like you took.

            I doubt there is a direct correlation. I wasnt talking about gun nuts, as you say, just people who thought we should have a gun. Having a gun is not always the answer to threats, or perceived threats. A police officer once told me he wont ready his gun unless he is prepared to take a life. That is a sobering thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with you that religious people seem more afraid of death. It doesnt make sense considering the promise of afterlife that is central to most faiths.

            Indeed, heavy media coverage of violent acts helps create the perceived reality of America as a very dangerous place. There has always been violence, and recent senseless killings are nothing new. As for the argument that we all should be armed: The next time you go out in public, look at the people around you and imagine each of them having a semi-automatic on their person. Are you a quick draw? The next time you accidently cut someone off on the highway, would you rather a middle finger, or a 45 slug come at you? It doesnt seem to be a practical answer.
           </p>

            I think it is our seeming vulnerability that may protect us. We pose no threat, and little opportunity for the bad guys. How many bicycle jackings have you heard of? They want your valuable car and the gun in the glove box, not our sleeping bag and tent. And dont discount the kindness of strangers: In Turkey, in the middle of the Iraq war, I saw people calm a yelling young man who did seem to hate America. The others knew that a man and a woman on a tandem bicycle did not hate them, or we would not have made ourselves so vulnerable to them. Jesus got it right. It was the establishment who killed him, not random violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, I support the Second Amendment. I do believe the First Amendment is more powerful, and better represents America to the world.

            I have to agree with the majority of the above comments that religion does seem to play a part in how people handle fear and anticipate danger around them. When I lived in Texas between 1985 and 1994, I worked with many people of all faiths. The big gun owners tended to be Baptists or members of the more evangelical Protestant religions. I did not know of one Jewish person or any belonging to the more orthodox faiths that owned a gun, other than perhaps a hunting rifle.

            Owning a gun does not really offer you any more safety from the typical criminal than not having one. Are you going to drive around with a pistol in your lap  just in case you might be car-jacked? Are you going to carry one into the local Walgreens  in anticipation of a possible raid by whacked out druggies? Are you going to take one to your childs school, just in case a kidnapper or pervert happens to be roaming the schoolyard? Would you carry one in a holster or in your pocket all day in your own home, just in case the postman (you know their history) or pizza delivery guy (mostly ex-cons and crazy teenagers) decide to ring your bell and then bust through your door?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the Constitutional right to bear arms has been settled. We have that right to own a gun  for any valid personal purpose and self-protection. On the other hand, I see no reason at all why AK-47s and M-16s are being sold over-the-counter at gun shops and flea markets. Why would any citizen not involved with law enforcement or the military need armor piercing bullets?  If I owned any of these weapons I would be in constant FEAR that someone WOULD break into my house to steal my guns or that one of my grandchildren would come for visit and decide to go target shooting in the backyard.  Or even worse  what if I really pissed off my wife?

            Lets face it: Having a gun was no advantage to anyone during the 9/11 attacks. There were armed guards and military police on duty at the Pentagon when it was hit. They had no advantage over their unarmed co-workers. More often than not, 7-11 clerks who are armed get shot more often during a robbery than those who arent.

            It is true that when the state of Florida modified their concealed weapon laws to allow average citizens to carry guns, certain types of crimes did go down. But criminals are a smart bunch, so they simply changed their approach to their job of robbing homes or mugging people. So crime went back up again almost immediately  but now the poor and elderly were the prime targets. The states drug dealers, most of who already carried guns  license or no  continued to die at a growing rate.

            And bars on windows? Any determined burglar can get past them, but in case of a fire, homeowners and their children cant. But they do serve one good purpose: Doors and windows with bars will drive down property values faster than any recession can.

            A Couple of Thoughts on Fear and Guns for You to Ponder
           </p>
           <p>
            A friend of my wifes was at our house the other day and the topic of conversation shifted from the the normal women BS to the concerns of what the current administration was planning to do about our gun laws.  The friend asked me if I had a gun in our house to which I said, I certainly do! Several as a matter of fact. She asked me if they were loaded.  I said of course theyre loaded, they cant work unless there loaded.with bullets. She then asked if I was afraid if someone was going to break into our house.  I said no I wasnt afraid of that happening, no more than Im afraid of my house burning down but I keep a loaded fire extinguisher in the house too, just in case.
           </p>
           <p>
            She then said you know guns kill people.  I then said is that so? and I quoted something I once heard along time ago that has stuck with me for years.  I replied,  If guns kill people then pencils misspell words, cars make people drive drunk and spoons made Rosie ODonnell fat! She sulled up like an opossum and dropped the subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeeze,  Ive had guns around forever.  I got my first one when I was 8 years old for Christmas and too this day I have not pointed them at anybody but, if i need too I will for the protection of my family or my possessions. It works alot better than pointing my finger and saying stop or Ill crap my pants!
           </p>
           <p>
            To me guns are a sporting tool just like a baseball bat or a football.  Its kind of hard to enjoy the sport if your not properly outfitted for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bob, this is another excellent post. Keep up the thought provoking work!

            Good responses, but dont assume I dont have a gun in my home. I would rather criminals not know than to advertise that I do, and have them break in to get my gun(s). A lot of B&amp;Es here in AZ are to steal guns and amo, so they are less traceable. So my opinion is that its best to leave em guessing. The fire extinguisher is an interesting analogy, but a criminal cant kill you with your own fire extinguisher.

            There are issues with guns: do you lock them up, and risk not being able to get to them in time, but also risk a young or stupid visitor playing with them and shooting somebody, or criminal getting to them before you do A gun sport, and gun activist, friend of mine was shot accidentialy by his son at a firing range; a seemingly safe situation (it was small cal. and single shot and he healed)  Familiarity is important with guns, but when does familiarity lead to lack of safety?  What is the protocol for gun use? Does the woman know how to shoot, would she? Would the teen borrow your guns, and who would he try to impress? All these are questions that need to be answered, and Im not sure everyone who owns guns want to think about all this. They should.

            John Hoyle wrote Lets face it: Having a gun was no advantage to anyone during the 9/11 attacks. There were armed guards and military police on duty at the Pentagon when it was hit. They had no advantage over their unarmed co-workers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that is ridiculous, John. I doubt you will find a single person anywhere who feels a weapon suitable for concealed carry is suitable for defense against planes or bombs. Firearms are also not useful against fires, automobile crashes and sinking ships. Firearms ARE useful for self defense. According to the best study available, in the US they are suitable for that about two million times a year.

            John also wrote:  More often than not, 7-11 clerks who are armed get shot more often during a robbery than those who arent.
           </p>
           <p>
            OK, lets see your source for that sound bite. Did you know that 7-11 forbids their employees bringing weapons to work?
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who fear firearms often make up facts because the real facts oppose their ideas. For example, you mentioned Florida. Florida has just enjoyed the lowest crime rate it has had since records have been kept.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dont mind if you oppose firearms. It is your choice. Just dont try to make it MY choice.
