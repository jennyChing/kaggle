           Excerpted from the Bureau of Justice Statistics:
          </p>
          <p>
           "Violent crime rates in the nation's public and private schools in 2003 remain unchanged and continued at about half those recorded in 1992, according to a joint study published today by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. The study examined a variety of school crime and safety indicators, including self-reported victimization data gathered from students aged 12-18 years old who were attending public and private schools. The study, "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2005," was written by staff members of the US Department of Education, the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, and MPR Associates, Inc.
          </p>
          <p>
           The publication it can be found at: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/iscs05.htm.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is the eighth in an annual series and is organized as a series of indicators, with each indicator presenting data on a different aspect of school crime and safety.  Additional information about BJS statistical reports and programs is available from the BJS website at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs."
          </p>
          <p>
           Does anyone have similar information to share regarding school violence rates overseas?

          </h3>
          <p>
           Crime victim compensation programs have become a significant resource to victims of violent crime and their families as they recover from the devastating impact of crime. The programs provide desperately needed financial assistance that helps victims pay for some crime-related costs such as medical treatment, mental health counseling, lost wages, and funeral and burial expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet international crime victim compensation programs are not a panacea because they rarely cover all of the victim's loss. However,  U.S. state compensation programs in conjunction with foreign programs may create effective partnerships that better address the needs of American citizens who are victimized overseas.
          </p>
          <p>
           For additional information, see the Office for Victims of Crime 2004-2005 updates to the International Crime Victim Compensation Program Directory (now called the Directory of International Crime Victim Compensation Programs), available at http://www.ovc.gov/publications/infores/intdir2005/welcome.html.

           New Crime Stats Shows Continuing Drop in US Murder Rates
          </h3>
          <p>
           Major news outlets are reporting on the drop in violent crime rates as announced in the FBI's annual Crime in the United States Report.  Although not as precipitous as those experienced over the past decade, some experts are attributing the decline to targeted law enforcement efforts against such areas as gang violence.  Southern states experienced the greatest drop in violent crime rates, despite still accounting for 43% of the nation's murders.
          </p>
          <p>
           Taken from information pulled from the FBI's Unified Crime Reporting (UCR) program, the report also includes information on annual rates of violent crime, property crime, hate crime, arson, arrests, and the number of police officers and civilian law enforcement personnel who combat these crimes.  This report also includes specialized studies on arrests of juveniles for drug abuse violations and infants as victims of crime.
          </p>
          <p>

           Stop Anti-Drug Ads to Pay for Katrina
          </h3>
          <p>
           The Republican Study Committee, a group of over 100 US House Republicans, released a report today staying that the longstanding US Anti-Drug shows "no solid evidence that media campaigns are effective in either preventing or reducing the use of illegal drugs."  The committee headed by Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind, states ending the campaign could save the government $1.3 billion over 10 years.  They suggest this money be routed towards programs to pay for Katrina clean-up.
          </p>
          <p>
           ONDCP is obviously supporting the initiative.  However, recent campaigns have received harsh creative criticism.  Several years ago, consumers and the industry alike universally panned one ad run during the Super Bowl.
          </p>
          <p>
           The new "Above the Influence" campaign, by New York advertising agency, Foote Cone &amp; Belding is scheduled to launch this fall.  The US Senate recently voted to cut the campaigns budget from the current $120 million to $95 million.

           The lawlessness in the storm and flood plagued city of New Orleans this week made us wonder a bit about the sociology of looting.  We looked through our WJIN database and didn't find anything of particular interest.  A web search turned up a large number of newspaper articles, and one research study surrounding thepredictors of neighborhood looting using the 1977 New York City blackout as a backdrop.

           While this article is enlightening, we thought this would be an opportunity to do our first call for existing research.  We wonder if anyone in the WJIN community has produced research on the topic. If so, please feel free to add a comment to this post and let us all know about your findings.   Give us a link to the material if it is online, or summarize in the comments.  This sort of exchange is what WJIN is all about.

           Google Maps and Crime
          </h3>
          <p>
           I think everyone agrees, Google's new mapping product is one of the most interesting and useful tools on the web.  With an open architecture, map ethusiasts from around the world are creating "mash-ups" or a combination of some sort of data with the google maps infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mapsexoffenders.com has mapped sex offenders in 36 states, with the aim of going national within the near future.  Chicago and Richmond, Virginia have both listed current crime scenes on a google powered mapping system.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Washington Post seems to be getting on board with Google Maps mashups in a big way as well.  They recently hired 23 year old ChicagoCrime.org creator, Adrian Holvaty and even created a new job category for him, according to Google Maps Mania, a blog about all things Google Map related.

           14th Annual World Congress of Criminology
          </h3>
          <p>
           An entry by Jen Hanley from the 14th World Congress of Criminology
          </p>
          <p>
           This week, criminal justice researchers from 65 countries arrived in Philadelphia (USA) for the 14th World Congress of Criminology.  This symposium, which meets every 2 to 5 years, brings together some of the leading international experts in such areas as restorative justice, violence &amp; victimization, policing, and transnational organized crime.
          </p>
          <p>
           With this gathering of researchers from such divergent backgrounds and disciplines, discussions have been provocative.  We take this opportunity to invite feedback from all our new WJIN readers to share their views on the information presented at this event, and to discuss ongoing work and opinions on the field of criminology.
