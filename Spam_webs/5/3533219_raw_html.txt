    <h3>
     Tom O Bedlams
    </h3>
    <p>
     T
     <small>
      HE
     </small>
     history of a race of singular mendicants, known by the name of
     <i>
      Tom o Bedlams,
     </i>
     connects itself with that of our poetry. Not only will they live with our language, since Shakespeare has perpetuated their existence, but they themselves appear to have been the occasion of creating a species of wild fantastic poetry, peculiar to our nation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bethlem Hospital formed, in its original institution, a contracted and penurious charity; its governors soon discovered that the metropolis furnished them with more lunatics than they had calculated on; they also required from the friends of the patients a weekly stipend, besides clothing. It is a melancholy fact to record in the history of human nature, that when one of their original regulations prescribed that persons who put in patients should provide their clothes, it was soon observed that the poor lunatics were frequently perishing by the omission of this slight duty from those former friends; so soon forgotten were they whom none found an interest to recollect. They were obliged to open contributions to provide a wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
     In consequence of the limited resources of the Hospital, they relieved the establishment by frequently discharging patients whose cure might be very equivocal. Harmless lunatics thrown thus into the world, often without a single friend, wandered about the country, chanting wild ditties, and wearing a fantastical dress to attract the notice of the charitable, on whose alms they lived. They had a kind of costume, which I find described by Randle Holme in a curious and extraordinary work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bedlam has a long staff, and a cow or ox-horn by his side; his cloathing fantastic and ridiculous; for being a madman, he is madly decked and dressed all over with robins (ribands), feathers, cuttings of cloth, and what not, to make him seem a madman, or one distracted, when he is no other than a wandering and dissembling knave. This writer here points out one of the grievances resulting from licensing even harmless lunatics to roam about the country; for a set of pretended madmen, called Abram men, a cant term for certain sturdy rogues, concealed themselves in their
     <i>
      costume,
     </i>
     covered the country, and pleaded the privileged denomination when detected in their depredations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir Walter Scott first obligingly suggested to me that these roving lunatics were out-door pensioners of Bedlam, sent about to live as well as they could with the pittance granted by the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fullest account that I have obtained of these singular persons is drawn from a manuscript note transcribed from some of Aubreys papers, which I have not seen printed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Till the breaking out of the civil wars,
     <i>
      Tom o Bedlams
     </i>
     did travel about the country; they had been poor distracted men, that had been put into Bedlam, where recovering some soberness, they were licentiated to go a begging;
     <i>
      i.e.
     </i>
     they had on their left arm an armilla, an iron ring for the arm, about four inches long, as printed in some works.
     <sup>
      4
     </sup>
     They could not get it off; they wore about their necks a great horn of an ox in a string or bawdry, which, when they came to a house, they did wind, and they put the drink given to them into this horn, whereto they put a stopple. Since the wars I do not remember to have seen any one of them. The civil wars, probably, cleared the country of all sorts of vagabonds; but among the royalists or the parliamentarians, we did not know that in their rank and file they had so many Tom o Bedlams.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have now to explain something in the character of E
     <small>
      DGAR
     </small>
     in L
     <small>
      EAR
     </small>
     , on which the commentators seem to have ingeniously blundered, from an imperfect knowledge of the character which E
     <small>
      DGAR
     </small>
     personates.
    </p>
    <p>
     E
     <small>
      DGAR
     </small>
     , in wandering about the country for a safe disguise, assumes the character of these
     <i>
      Tom o Bedlams;
     </i>
     he thus closes one of his distracted speeches, Poor Tom,
     <i>
      Thy horn is dry!
     </i>
      On this Johnson is content to inform us, that men that begged under pretence of lunacy used formerly to carry a horn and blow it through the streets. This is no explanation of Edgars allusion to the
     <i>
      dryness
     </i>
     of his horn. Steevens adds a fanciful note, that Edgar alludes to a proverbial expression
     <i>
      Thy horn is dry,
     </i>
     designed to express that a man had said all he could say; and, further, Steevens supposes that Edgar speaks these words aside; as if he had been quite weary of
     <i>
      Tom o Bedlams part,
     </i>
     and could not keep it up any longer. The reasons of all this conjectural criticism are a curious illustration of perverse ingenuity. Aubreys manuscript note has shown us that the Bedlams horn was also a
     <i>
      drinking-horn,
     </i>
     and Edgar closes his speech in the perfection of the assumed character, and not as one who had grown weary of it, by making the mendicant lunatic desirous of departing from a heath, to march, as he cries, to wakes, and fairs, and market-townsPoor Tom! thy horn is dry! as more likely places to solicit alms; and he is thinking of his
     <i>
      drink-money,
     </i>
     when he cries that 
     <i>
      his horn is dry
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     An itinerant lunatic, chanting wild ditties, fancifully attired, gay with the simplicity of childhood, yet often moaning with the sorrows of a troubled man, a mixture of character at once grotesque and plaintive, became an interesting object to poetical minds. It is probable that the character of Edgar, in the Lear of Shakespeare, first introduced the hazardous conception into the poetical world. Poems composed in the character of a Tom o Bedlam appear to have formed a fashionable class of poetry among the wits; they seem to have held together poetical contests, and some of these writers became celebrated for their successful efforts, for old Isaac Walton mentions a Mr. William Basse as one who has made the choice songs of the Hunter in his career, and of Tom o Bedlam, and many other of note. Bishop Percy, in his Reliques of ancient English Poetry, has preserved six of what he calls Mad Songs, expressing his surprise that the English should have more songs and ballads on the subject of madness than any of their neighbours, for such are not found in the collections of songs of the French, Italian, &amp;c., and nearly insinuates, for their cause, that we are perhaps more liable to the calamity of madness than other nations. This superfluous criticism had been spared had that elegant collector been more aware of the circumstance which had produced this class of poems, and recollected the more ancient original in the Edgar of Shakespeare. Some of the Mad Songs which the Bishop has preserved are of too modern a date to suit the title of this work; being written by Tom DUrfey, for his comedies of Don Quixote. I shall preserve one of more ancient date, fraught with all the wild spirit of this peculiar character.

     This poem must not be read without a perpetual reference to the personated character. Delirious and fantastic, strokes of sublime imagination are mixed with familiar comic humour, and even degraded by the cant language; for the gipsy habits of life of these Tom o Bedlams had confounded them with the progging Abram men. These luckless beings are described by Decker as sometimes exceeding merry, and could do nothing but sing songs fashioned out of their own brains; now they danced, now they would do nothing but laugh and weep, or were dogged and sullen both in look and speech. All they did, all they sung, was alike unconnected; indicative of the desultory and rambling wits of the chanter.

     In that curious source of our domestic history, the English Villanies of Decker, we find a lively description of the Abram Cove, or Abram man, the impostor who personated a Tom oBedlam. He was terribly disguised with his grotesque rags, his staff, his knotted hair, and with the more disgusting contrivances to excite pity, still practised among a class of our mendicants, who, in their cant language are still said to sham Abraham. This impostor was, therefore, as suited his purpose and the place, capable of working on the sympathy, by uttering a silly
     <i>
      maunding,
     </i>
     or demanding of charity, or terrifying the easy fears of women, children, and domestics, as he wandered up and down the country: they refused nothing to a being who was as terrific to them as Robin Goodfellow, or Raw-head and bloody-bones. Thus, as Edgar expresses it, sometimes with lunatic bans, sometimes with prayers, the gestures of this impostor were a counterfeit puppet-play: they came with a hollow noise, whooping, leaping, gambolling, wildly dancing, with a fierce or distracted look. These sturdy mendicants were called Tom of Bedlams band of madcaps, or Poor Toms flock of wild geese. Decker has preserved their Maund, or beggingGood worship master, bestow your reward on a poor man that hath been in Bedlam without Bishopsgate, three years, four months, and nine days, and bestow one piece of small silver towards his fees, which he is indebted there, Of 3

Such is a history drawn from the very archives of mendicity and imposture; and written perhaps as far back as the reign of James I.; but which prevailed in that of Elizabeth, as Shakspeare has so finely shown in his E

They described themselves as cruelly treated in Bedlam, and nearly in the words of Shakspeares Edgar.
