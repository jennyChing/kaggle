Whether by choice or medical necessity, many of our staffers have opted to cut the wheat out of their diets and have nothing but praises to sing for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nAccording to nutrition expert &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.drfranklipman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Dr. Frank Lipman&lt;\/a&gt;, they've got the right idea. Gluten is a hard-to-digest protein that can be found in many grains such as wheat, barley, rye, couscous, bulgur, and spelt. Says Lipman, the grain with the highest gluten content and the one we eat the most of, by far, is wheat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAnd what, pray tell, is so bad about gluten? In moderation, it's perfectly acceptable for the average person, but many people either eat too much of it, or have an underlying sensitivity to it. \"The majority of patients who are intolerant to these grains have a non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\" says Lipman. \"The reaction to gluten creates inflammation throughout the body, with wide-ranging effects across all organ systems including your brain, heart, joints, digestive tract, and more. &lt;strong&gt;The majority of people who have a gluten sensitivity suffer chronically from a vague unwellness, which doctors don\u2019t diagnose&lt;\/strong&gt;.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nDr. Lipman also says that &lt;strong&gt;gluten sensitivity has been linked to a wide range of health woes&lt;\/strong&gt;, including fatigue, aches and pains, weight gain, recurrent canker sores, neurological symptoms, nausea, bloating, constipation, rashes, and even infertility. Upon cutting out gluten, Lipman says many of his patients' issues gradually cleared up and they lost that vague feeling of unwellness that plagued many of them for most of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; \n\nWorth noting: One downside to cutting out gluten is that you may see a dip in your fiber intake, but he says it's easy to supplement that loss by adding other fiber-rich foods to your diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nSo, how do you tell if you're one of those (not-so) lucky individuals with a gluten sensitivity? Lipman says you have to cut it out first in order to discover if you've got issues. \"After eliminating gluten, if you eat it again, you may have a more pronounced initial response,\" he says. \"This can be helpful information because you will be able to see if you're sensitive to gluten. The spectrum of sensitivity really varies from person to person \u2014 it's not all-or-nothing. Don't get stressed about the decision.

I have Celiac disease, so I need to be pretty vigilant with reading labels and ensuring there are no wheat products in the food that I eat. Gluten-free for life, baby.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to go\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Sophomore year of college, I remember feeling super-lethargic all the time with an overall lack of energy. I went to the doctor, who then discovered that I had a strong gluten-intolerance bordering on Celiac disease. I was never a huge bread and pasta person, so to me it didn't feel like a drastic change \u2014 just more of a lifestyle change\nand commitment to my health.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Breakfast is coffee and a yogurt with gluten-free granola. Lunch is salad with some form of protein like chicken or tuna. For a snack, I have a Lara Bar, potato chips, nuts, or fruit. Dinner is sushi with gluten-free tamari sauce or gluten-free pasta.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; \n\"Drunk food and hangover food. Who doesn't want to chow down on a greasy slice of pizza after a night of imbibing, or soothe a throbbing hangover with a big \u2018ol toasted bagel and cream cheese.\u00a0Luckily, I've found some decent substitutions.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u00a0\n\"How my body feels \u2013 a lot more refreshed and rejuvenated. It\u2019s also quite the conversation starter and a nice common thread when you discover someone else is gluten-free! All of a sudden you have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;\/em&gt; much to talk about.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt; \"Yes! I have so much more energy, and feel a lot less tired and heavy. It\u2019s definitely improved my overall physical and mental health.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever cheat?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Not intentionally. I'm usually pretty careful about checking labels, but occasionally I'll forget, and then discover later that something totally random had gluten in it. Note to all Celiacs out there: Wasabi peas? Pizza Pringles? Haribo Gummies? All have gluten. Now, how would anyone have known that!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What gluten food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I love baking, so I do miss sweets and pastries. Luckily, one of my best friends, Julia, also has Celiac disease and makes a killer gluten-free pineapple upside-down cake. It has become the default birthday cake for our entire circle of friends and always receives rave reviews, even from the gluten eaters!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of advice would you offer to anyone who is considering gluten-\nfree?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; \n\"Do it for the right reasons. Don't do it to lose weight, or because you want to try the new 'fad-diet' \u2014 you likely won\u2019t shrink down to a size two. In fact, often times gluten-free alternatives have more calories. Obviously, in my case, I had no choice, but if it is a conscious decision I would encourage people to commit to it. I see so many people who claim to be 'gluten-free' and then when no one is looking, will sneak a slice of birthday cake or a big bite of a hamburger.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite\u00a0gluten-free brands\/foods?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/udisglutenfree.com\/product-category\/bagels\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Udi's Bagels&lt;\/a&gt; are the best! I also love Udi's and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakeryonmain.com\/Products\/Store\/tabid\/135\/categoryid\/5\/glutenfreegranola\/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bakery on Main granola&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bionaturae.com\/gluten-free-pasta.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bionaturae&lt;\/a&gt; makes the best gluten-free pasta. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.larabar.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Lara Bars&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.glutino.com\/our-products\/snacks\/pretzels\/pretzels-twists-8oz-us\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Glutino Pretzels&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.tatesbakeshop.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tate\u2019s Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies&lt;\/a&gt; are the best snacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are some of your favorite places to eat gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/risotteria.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Risotteria&lt;\/a&gt; in the West Village and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.palapizza.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pala Pizza&lt;\/a&gt; in Soho. Both of these places have separate ovens and utensils for all of the gluten-free food, which definitely puts me at ease as far as cross contamination goes. If you go to Pala Pizza order the Zucca. Butternut squash puree on a pizza may sound weird, but it\nis the most delicious thing ever! And the Limonata cocktail is the perfect summer drink to pair with it.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you offer some advice about eating out at restaurants when you are\ngluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"I always dread asking waiters at restaurants if there\nis wheat in this item or what dishes are guaranteed gluten free. I feel like it makes me sound so high-maintenance. It\u2019s obviously easier to go to gluten-free restaurants, or places that have a separate gluten-free menu. But, if you\u2019re at a regular restaurant, ask for hamburger without the bun or an egg sandwich without the bread (sounds weird, but I've definitely done it). Do be cautious though as oftentimes chefs use flour to thicken up sauces or salad dressing, so I always try and check.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your tried-and-true gluten-free recipes?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Pineapple-Upside Down Cake (makes one 9x13 cake)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n- 2 bags of Pamela\u2019s classic vanilla cake mix (follow recipe on package but substitutepineapple juice from the can instead of water)&lt;br&gt;\n- 1 stick of butter&lt;br&gt;\n- \u00be - 1 cup of brown sugar&lt;br&gt;\n- 1 can of whole ring canned pineapple (in juice, not heavy syrup)\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Melt butter over the stove and pour into 9x13 pan.  Evenly distribute brown sugar over melted butter and stir until it becomes a sugar paste. Drain the canned pineapple (save the juice for the cake batter) and place the pineapple\nrings on top of the brown sugar mixture. Prepare cake batter per the instructions on the bag and pour the batter on top of the pineapples and brown sugar. Bake as directed on the package. Once the cake is done, immediately flip the cake over to cool on a pan. Serve warm with a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Yes this recipe uses a cake mix, but it is so damn good! I swear it tastes like it\u2019s\nmade from scratch and saves you the hassle of buying all of the specialty gluten-free baking ingredients.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"For me, a gluten-free lifestyle is not a choice and I would be doing damage to my body by living any other way. Obviously, any diet taken to the extreme can be detrimental to your health, but I know several people who have ridden the gluten-free wave and immediately felt like a new person! Living a holistically healthy life should be top priority.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","credit":null,"impressiontracker":"","preview_image":{"src":"\/\/s2.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/b9f\/x\/528324\/image.jpg","original_width_px":600,"original_height_px":400},"is_pinnable":true,"is_facebook_shareable":true,"clicktracker":"","products":[]}},{"type":"image:jpg","content":{"entry_asset_id":"153692","resource":"\/\/s1.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/cc7\/x\/528323\/image.jpg","alignment":"left","description":"&lt;strong&gt;Gluten-free since:&lt;\/strong&gt; March 2012&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you completely\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Pretty much. I won't freak out if I eat a stray breadcrumb, but I prefer to steer clear of it completely.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to go\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"My best girlfriend was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, and she inspired me to read more about nutrition related to cancer and other diseases. Everything I had been reading about how wheat has been genetically modified over the years and how your body has a hard time recognizing what it is, which, in turn, causes inflammation, really freaked me out. I tried it as an experiment, and so far, so good.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"For breakfast, I generally have fruit or a rice-based cereal or toast. Sometimes an organic egg, too. For lunch, it's usually some kind of vegetable concoction (salad or otherwise), with plant-based proteins like lentils, chick peas, or quinoa. I eat dairy so hard cheese is a daily staple, too. Dinner is generally some kind of saut\u00e9ed vegetable with tempeh or brown rice, and if I'm eating out, I'll have a good piece of wild salmon. There are (dangerously) loads of\u00a0gluten-free sweets out there, so I like Udi chocolate-chip cookies with coconut-milk ice cream as a treat.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Eating out. Pasta haunts me.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I never, ever feel bloated. Since I gave it up, I rarely feel tired during the day, and just recently, I've noticed my skin has a luminous glow to it. People have commented on it, too, so I know it can't just be me.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt;\n\"Yes, things in my body just work better now. I feel like wheat was slowing everything down, and now it just runs more smoothly.\"\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever cheat?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"No. Even though I don't have a\u00a0gluten\u00a0allergy, I just don't want to eat it anymore. A good slice of pizza is another story though\u2026\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u00a0gluten\u00a0food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u00a0\"Pizza and pasta.

I'm strict about not eating\u00a0gluten\u00a0during the day, especially before and during work hours, but I'll have pasta or bread maybe once or twice a week for dinner. I'm about 95 percent\u00a0gluten-free.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to go\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I noticed when I started working full-time here at Refinery29 that I would get exhausted in the middle of the day. I'm not talking about\u00a0 the mid-day slump that everyone gets \u2014 I could barely keep my eyes open by 4 p.m. So, I started playing around with my diet and found out that when I cut out\u00a0gluten, I stayed alert all day long. From then on, I stopped eating\u00a0gluten\u00a0before and during my work day.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"For breakfast I eat Greek yogurt with a granola mix I made from\u00a0gluten-free oats. Lunch is typically a bowl of black beans with half of an avocado, butternut squash soup, or whatever I have left over from last night. Dinner varies a lot, but it's usually something like turkey meatballs and a salad, or eggplant slices stuffed with spinach and feta cheese.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I like that it forced me to be more creative with what I eat and helped me realize that fruits and vegetables had to be more at the forefront of my diet.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt;\"Yes, being mostly\u00a0gluten-free has helped me have much, much more energy during the day. The difference has been like night and day \u2014 it's so nice not to be tired all of the time!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever cheat?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Yes, but not too much. I'll have pasta once or twice a week or so for dinner, and I like to have whole-grain bread for breakfast on the weekends. Also, once every few weeks we get bagels for breakfast here at the office, and I just can't resist having one (the\u00a0gluten-free ones just aren't the same!).\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u00a0gluten\u00a0food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Anything bread related. They say that man can't live on bread alone, but seriously, give me a glass of water and a good baguette and I'll be happy forever.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of advice would you offer to anyone who is considering\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Just give it a try \u2014 maybe it'll make a big difference in your overall health like it did for me, or maybe it won't do anything for you. Still, I think a lot of us eat more\u00a0gluten products than we're conscious of, so I think cutting back worth a try for everyone.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite\u00a0gluten-free brands\/foods?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobsredmill.com\/Gluten-Free\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bob's Red Mill &lt;\/a&gt;makes a lot of great\u00a0gluten-free flours and oats. They can be a bit expensive and I'm sure there are other brands out there, but this is what my local supermarket carries and I'm happy to have these options readily on hand when I cook.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are some of your favorite places to eat\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I don't eat out much, but when I do, I'm not so concerned with whether or not it's\u00a0gluten-free, since it's a treat for me. However, on the days when I don't bring lunch to work, I'm always happy to indulge in an arepa from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.caracasarepabar.com\/index_2.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Caracas Arepa Bar&lt;\/a&gt;. The base is a cornmeal cake stuffed with all sorts of amazing fillings (try the La Del Gato, it will change your life), so I get that feeling of having a sandwich without having to worry about bread and conking out in an hour.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your tried-and-true gluten-free recipes?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I actually have a hard time cooking\u00a0gluten-free, at least when I'm trying to turn something that usually has\u00a0gluten\u00a0in it into something\u00a0gluten-free (steering clear of\u00a0gluten altogether is easier). A lot of recipes call for nut flours, and nuts give me canker sores, and I hate the taste of anything made with chickpea flour. I do, however, love &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/smittenkitchen.com\/2007\/10\/gluten-free-chocolate-financiers\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Smitten Kitchen's recipe for Chocolate Financiers&lt;\/a&gt;. Their cake-like texture is so wonderful and comforting, and they're just the perfect little sweet for whenever I get a chocolate craving. Even though they're made with almond flour, to me they're totally worth getting a sore or two \u2014 they're that good.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I don't want to make anybody's decisions for them. For me, I was just experimenting with my diet and finding out that going mostly\u00a0gluten-free made\u00a0 a huge difference in my health.

Usually I have a\u00a0Blueprint Cleanse Juice\u00a0on my way to the train. At lunch, I eat sushi religiously every day. I venture out mid-day for a chai latte as a pick me up and to just walk around. \u00a0At dinner when eating out I like to keep to seafoods, veggies, salads, and I love ordering a mass assortment of small plates at restaurants. \u00a0If I cook at home, it's rice and fish, or pureed veggie soups or stews over rice.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"The most difficult part is\u00a0my penchant for croissants and cupcakes. \u00a0Thankfully marcarons are naturally\u00a0gluten-free so I can curb my cravings at\u00a0Ladur\u00e9e,\u00a0my favorite place in the world.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"It really makes me feel better and frankly, I.

I had been speaking with Dr. Frank Lipman for a prior story and he mentioned something called the Elimination Diet \u2014 cutting out dairy, caffeine, sugar, red meat, gluten, and soy for a month, then reintroducing them into your diet one at a time to see if you had a reaction. I found my body reacted poorly to wheat and dairy, so ever since then I've been trying my hardest to minimize my consumption.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Against the advice of every nutritionist I've ever spoken with, I'm not a big breakfast person.

I'm pretty sure I spend half my paycheck there, but frankly the food is so good that I'm willing to go bankrupt for it. Dinner is a little tougher since my husband is the kind of guy who can eat everything and anything. My willpower is weak, so if he suggests pasta or pizza, I usually cave.  Most of the time I try to make food that I can easily add gluten-free substitutes, like burgers with sprouted-grain buns and soy cheese. For snacks, I'm a devoted acolyte of kale chips.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Being around people who aren't gluten-free. When I go out with friends, I can't just go to any old restaurant \u2014 I have to make sure the place we are going has gluten-free options. I'm also the most hated person at my friend's monthly potluck dinners as no one seems to share my devotion to sweet potatoes and quinoa.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I've never been a 'healthy' eater, so there's a smug sense of satisfaction I get from being a good eater for once in my life. Selfish and self-involved, but true.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt;\n\"I haven't felt this healthy in years. Usually when I eat a big meal, I feel weighed down and uncomfortably full. When I eat gluten-free, I feel satiated without feeling puffed up or gross. It's also had a great effect on my weight \u2014 I used to be about 15 lbs. heavier, but after cutting out gluten and dairy and reducing my sugar intake, I've lost all the stubborn weight that I never seemed able to shake before. As a long-time migraine sufferer, I definitely see a difference in the frequency of my headaches. They're not gone, but they're definitely not occurring as much as they used to. I notice the difference most whenever I 'accidentally' eat wheat \u2014 I wind up feeling bloated, heavy, and all-around yuck.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever cheat?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Yes, at least once or twice a week. As I said, my willpower is weak, so if someone tempts me with gluten foods, I usually end up caving. That's why I try to remove myself from those situations, so I don't set myself up for failure.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u00a0gluten\u00a0food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Pizza and pie. Pizza has everything that's bad for my system \u2014 gluten, dairy, and grease \u2014 but the very thought of a slice of pepperoni is making me drool as I type this. And I have never turned down a slice of raspberry pie in my 29 years of existence, nor do I ever intend on doing so. If you deprive yourself of what makes you happy and take the joy out of food, how can you ever feel good about your choices?\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of advice would you offer to anyone who is considering\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDefinitely try it first before you say it's not for you. Only after cutting it out did I realize that there were some health issues I was having that I didn't even know about. And don't berate yourself if you slip up now and then. You have to be realistic about the fact that this is a major life change and there will be the occasional cheat.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite\u00a0gluten-free brands\/foods?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Macaroni and cheese is pretty much one of my major food groups, so &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amys.com\/products\/product-detail\/entrees\/000043\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Amy's Organic Rice Macaroni and Dairy-Free Cheeze&lt;\/a&gt; is a weekly treat for me.

Never be afraid to ask your waiter if something is okay for you to eat as most places train their staff on how to deal with gluten-free requests. Remember: You're not being difficult or high-maintenance; you have a dietary restriction and that should never be a problem for a restaurant to accommodate.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"People tend to get very defensive when you talk about gluten-free and I really don't know why. Don't take other people's health choices so personally. If you're not down with gluten-free, that's fine, but don't tell people they are wrong for making a life choice that they think is right for them. You need to do what's healthy and right for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;\/em&gt; body and let other people decide what's right for them.

Lunch is anything from a homemade\u00a0gluten-free pasta salad with chicken, beans, and veggies to a frozen meal from Amy's \u2014 I go for their brown rice and veggies and their\u00a0gluten-free mac and cheese is YUM. For dinner, I usually have an omelet with feta cheese and broccoli and sometimes I'll add in a slice of millet bread. In between (I'm a snacker!), I eat a lot of fruit and, depending on the day, I'll munch on almonds, those little Babybel cheeses, carrots and hummus, or hardboiled eggs.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"The hardest thing is definitely eating with friends \u2014 either at restaurants or at dinner parties \u2014 because it's never fun to be that girl who has to ask the waiter fifty-seven questions about each item on the menu, and when someone prepares a meal for you, it feels really rude to ask a ton of questions or have to refuse the meal because it has\u00a0gluten\u00a0in it.

Honestly, I cheat more with sugar than I do with\u00a0gluten\u00a0because I've found so many\u00a0gluten-free substitutes for the foods I love, but when I do, it's usually with a piece of bread at a restaurant or a tempting dessert.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u00a0gluten\u00a0food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Crusty-on-the-outside, soft-and-chewy-on-the-inside fresh-baked bread. I've found really good\u00a0gluten-free substitutes for pretty much everything else I love, but no matter how much I enjoy millet bread (and I really do), it's a totally different consistency than the kind of fresh-from-the-oven bread that is just heaven on its own.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of advice would you offer to anyone who is considering\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I would say that it's important to understand what\u00a0gluten\u00a0is first, so you have a general idea of foods it would likely be in and those it wouldn't \u2014 that makes food shopping oh-so-much easier. Definitely stock up on food since eating out is a bit of a crap shoot. Then, try it for two weeks and see how it goes. If you like how you feel, you'll be motivated to stick to it.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite\u00a0gluten-free brands\/foods?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"I really like Food For Life Millet Bread \u2014 again with the millet bread, I know, but it's really far-and-beyond the best\u00a0gluten-, dairy-, and egg-free bread I've had. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.naturespath.com\/products\/vegetarian\/crunchy-vanilla-sunrise\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nature's Path&lt;\/a&gt; has delish cereals; Glutino pretzels are almost as good as the real thing, and you can always count on Amy's for a good\u00a0gluten-free frozen meal. Other than that, it's all about the whole foods!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are some of your favorite places to eat\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Tu-Lu's Bakery and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lulassweetapothecary.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Lula's Sweet Apothecary&lt;\/a&gt; \u2014 obviously not great for the whole sugar-free thing, but they're really delicious and both have vegan options as well. Also, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.piebythepound.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pie&lt;\/a&gt; makes really tasty\u00a0gluten-free pizza and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.caravanofdreams.net\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Caravan of Dreams&lt;\/a&gt; has a super creative menu that's also vegetarian. I'd go to all four places even if I wasn't\u00a0gluten-free!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you offer some advice about eating out at restaurants when you are\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I don't like to be high-maintenance, so trying to order\u00a0gluten-free at restaurants is not my favorite thing. That said, it's obviously important to know what you're putting in your body, so it's a necessary evil. First, I try to weed out what I already know has\u00a0gluten\u00a0in it from the menu \u2014 again, this is why it's helpful to know what\u00a0gluten\u00a0is and the kinds of things it's in. Then, don't assume that your waiter (or even the chef) knows what\u00a0gluten\u00a0is and whether or not it's in a dish. If your waiter clearly doesn't know, just ask how something is prepared or ask if there is any flour, soy, breadcrumbs (more familiar ingredients) involved in the meal. A lot of times,\u00a0gluten\u00a0can pop up in salad dressings, seasonings, and other foods you wouldn't necessarily expect, so you can always just ask for oil and vinegar or ask that your meal is simply prepared without seasonings if the waiter is unsure what the ingredients are.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your tried-and-true gluten-free recipes?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"When I discovered the blog\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/glutenfreegoddess.blogspot.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Gluten\u00a0Free Goddess&lt;\/a&gt;, I pretty much became an addict, so this recipe comes from her genius mind \u2014 both tested and approved by unsuspecting non-GF friends.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Sweet Potato Turkey Enchiladas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n-2 cups of your favorite salsa \u2014 spicy or mild&lt;br&gt;\n-4 cups of cooked free-range organic turkey or chicken, hand torn or shredded&lt;br&gt;\nJuice from 2 fresh limes&lt;br&gt;\nSea salt and ground pepper&lt;br&gt;\n2 cups cooked sweet potato&lt;br&gt;\nPinch of cumin&lt;br&gt;\n2 4-oz. cans chopped roasted green chiles, drained&lt;br&gt;\nLight olive oil, as needed&lt;br&gt;\n12 corn tortillas&lt;br&gt;\n1 cup diced pineapple \u2014 no juice&lt;br&gt;\n1-2 cups shredded Jalape\u00f1o Jack cheese or vegan cheese for non-dairy&lt;br&gt;\nHot red pepper flakes, to taste\"&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Preheat oven to 350\u00baF. Pour about a half cup of salsa into the bottom a large, lightly-oiled 10x13\" baking dish, or use two smaller pans for six enchiladas each.

Add in 1 can of the roasted green chiles; mix. Add sea salt and pepper if it needs it. Heat a dash of olive oil in a skillet, and heat one corn tortilla until softened, turning it over once to coat with oil. Place the tortilla into the sauced baking dish. Add a spoonful of sweet potato down the center. Sprinkle with 1\/12 of the turkey. Roll up the enchilada, seam side down, and place it at the far end of the dish. Repeat for the remaining tortillas, adding more oil, if needed to soften them. Pour the remaining salsa over the rolled tortillas. Top with the diced pineapple and the second can of roasted green chiles. Sprinkle with cheese and red pepper flakes. Bake in a 350\u00baF. oven until the enchiladas are bubbling and heated through, about 30 minutes.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I think the important thing to remember in all of this is that everyone's body is different, and we all have different needs. You have to do what works for you. I've never been a proponent of completely cutting out certain foods, but if not eating\u00a0gluten\u00a0makes you feel better, then I say go for it. It's the same thing with meat, sugar, carbs, oregano...whatever! Obviously, you want to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need, but other than that, just listen to your body.\"","credit":null,"impressiontracker":"","preview_image":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/624\/x\/528330\/image.jpg","original_width_px":600,"original_height_px":400},"is_pinnable":true,"is_facebook_shareable":true,"clicktracker":"","products":[]}},{"type":"image:jpg","content":{"entry_asset_id":"153699","resource":"\/\/s1.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/95e\/x\/528331\/image.jpg","alignment":"left","description":"&lt;strong&gt;Gluten-free since:&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0April 2010\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you completely\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2028\"Completely!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to go\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I've got a\u00a0gluten\u00a0intolerance, so I didn't really have too much of a choice.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"It's almost like I'm on a permanent no-carb diet.\u00a0 For breakfast, eggs or yogurt, lunch is usually a salad or quinoa, and dinner is something along the same lines.

Both of these places have separate ovens and utensils for all of the gluten-free food, which definitely puts me at ease as far as cross contamination goes. If you go to Pala Pizza order the Zucca. Butternut squash puree on a pizza may sound weird, but it\nis the most delicious thing ever! And the Limonata cocktail is the perfect summer drink to pair with it.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you offer some advice about eating out at restaurants when you are\ngluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"I always dread asking waiters at restaurants if there\nis wheat in this item or what dishes are guaranteed gluten free. I feel like it makes me sound so high-maintenance. It\u2019s obviously easier to go to gluten-free restaurants, or places that have a separate gluten-free menu. But, if you\u2019re at a regular restaurant, ask for hamburger without the bun or an egg sandwich without the bread (sounds weird, but I've definitely done it). Do be cautious though as oftentimes chefs use flour to thicken up sauces or salad dressing, so I always try and check.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your tried-and-true gluten-free recipes?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Pineapple-Upside Down Cake (makes one 9x13 cake)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n- 2 bags of Pamela\u2019s classic vanilla cake mix (follow recipe on package but substitutepineapple juice from the can instead of water)&lt;br&gt;\n- 1 stick of butter&lt;br&gt;\n- \u00be - 1 cup of brown sugar&lt;br&gt;\n- 1 can of whole ring canned pineapple (in juice, not heavy syrup)\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Melt butter over the stove and pour into 9x13 pan.  Evenly distribute brown sugar over melted butter and stir until it becomes a sugar paste. Drain the canned pineapple (save the juice for the cake batter) and place the pineapple\nrings on top of the brown sugar mixture. Prepare cake batter per the instructions on the bag and pour the batter on top of the pineapples and brown sugar. Bake as directed on the package. Once the cake is done, immediately flip the cake over to cool on a pan. Serve warm with a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Yes this recipe uses a cake mix, but it is so damn good! I swear it tastes like it\u2019s\nmade from scratch and saves you the hassle of buying all of the specialty gluten-free baking ingredients.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"For me, a gluten-free lifestyle is not a choice and I would be doing damage to my body by living any other way. Obviously, any diet taken to the extreme can be detrimental to your health, but I know several people who have ridden the gluten-free wave and immediately felt like a new person! Living a holistically healthy life should be top priority.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","credit":null,"clicktracker":"","impressiontracker":"","products":[],"no_pin_it":"0","no_facebook":"0","sizes":{"50x":{"src":"\/\/s2.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/9bb\/50x\/528324\/image.jpg"},"75x":{"src":"\/\/s1.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/edc\/75x\/528324\/image.jpg"},"100x":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/a3c\/100x\/528324\/image.jpg"},"150x":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/33a\/150x\/528324\/image.jpg"},"400x400bm":{"src":"\/\/s2.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/bc8\/400x400bm\/528324\/image.jpg"},"720x389":{"src":"\/\/s1.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/b5b\/720x389\/528324\/image.jpg"},"x":{"src":"\/\/s2.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/b9f\/x\/528324\/image.jpg"}}},{"type":"image","description":"&lt;strong&gt;Gluten-free since:&lt;\/strong&gt; March 2012&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you completely\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Pretty much.

Everything I had been reading about how wheat has been genetically modified over the years and how your body has a hard time recognizing what it is, which, in turn, causes inflammation, really freaked me out.

Sometimes an organic egg, too. For lunch, it's usually some kind of vegetable concoction (salad or otherwise), with plant-based proteins like lentils, chick peas, or quinoa. I eat dairy so hard cheese is a daily staple, too. Dinner is generally some kind of saut\u00e9ed vegetable with tempeh or brown rice, and if I'm eating out, I'll have a good piece of wild salmon. There are (dangerously) loads of\u00a0gluten-free sweets out there, so I like Udi chocolate-chip cookies with coconut-milk ice cream as a treat.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Eating out. Pasta haunts me.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I never, ever feel bloated. Since I gave it up, I rarely feel tired during the day, and just recently, I've noticed my skin has a luminous glow to it.

I'm strict about not eating\u00a0gluten\u00a0during the day, especially before and during work hours, but I'll have pasta or bread maybe once or twice a week for dinner. I'm about 95 percent\u00a0gluten-free.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to go\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I noticed when I started working full-time here at Refinery29 that I would get exhausted in the middle of the day. I'm not talking about\u00a0 the mid-day slump that everyone gets \u2014 I could barely keep my eyes open by 4 p.m. So, I started playing around with my diet and found out that when I cut out\u00a0gluten, I stayed alert all day long.

Lunch is typically a bowl of black beans with half of an avocado, butternut squash soup, or whatever I have left over from last night. Dinner varies a lot, but it's usually something like turkey meatballs and a salad, or eggplant slices stuffed with spinach and feta cheese.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I like that it forced me to be more creative with what I eat and helped me realize that fruits and vegetables had to be more at the forefront of my diet.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt;\"Yes, being mostly\u00a0gluten-free has helped me have much, much more energy during the day.

They can be a bit expensive and I'm sure there are other brands out there, but this is what my local supermarket carries and I'm happy to have these options readily on hand when I cook.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are some of your favorite places to eat\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I don't eat out much, but when I do, I'm not so concerned with whether or not it's\u00a0gluten-free, since it's a treat for me. However, on the days when I don't bring lunch to work, I'm always happy to indulge in an arepa from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.caracasarepabar.com\/index_2.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Caracas Arepa Bar&lt;\/a&gt;. The base is a cornmeal cake stuffed with all sorts of amazing fillings (try the La Del Gato, it will change your life), so I get that feeling of having a sandwich without having to worry about bread and conking out in an hour.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your tried-and-true gluten-free recipes?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I actually have a hard time cooking\u00a0gluten-free, at least when I'm trying to turn something that usually has\u00a0gluten\u00a0in it into something\u00a0gluten-free (steering clear of\u00a0gluten altogether is easier). A lot of recipes call for nut flours, and nuts give me canker sores, and I hate the taste of anything made with chickpea flour. I do, however, love &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/smittenkitchen.com\/2007\/10\/gluten-free-chocolate-financiers\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Smitten Kitchen's recipe for Chocolate Financiers&lt;\/a&gt;. Their cake-like texture is so wonderful and comforting, and they're just the perfect little sweet for whenever I get a chocolate craving.

For me, I was just experimenting with my diet and finding out that going mostly\u00a0gluten-free made\u00a0 a huge difference in my health. I think I have a very well-rounded diet now, and I feel a lot healthier and more energetic than I did before.

I venture out mid-day for a chai latte as a pick me up and to just walk around. \u00a0At dinner when eating out I like to keep to seafoods, veggies, salads, and I love ordering a mass assortment of small plates at restaurants. \u00a0If I cook at home, it's rice and fish, or pureed veggie soups or stews over rice.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"The most difficult part is\u00a0my penchant for croissants and cupcakes. \u00a0Thankfully marcarons are naturally\u00a0gluten-free so I can curb my cravings at\u00a0Ladur\u00e9e,\u00a0my favorite place in the world.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"It really makes me feel better and frankly, I.

I had been speaking with Dr. Frank Lipman for a prior story and he mentioned something called the Elimination Diet \u2014 cutting out dairy, caffeine, sugar, red meat, gluten, and soy for a month, then reintroducing them into your diet one at a time to see if you had a reaction. I found my body reacted poorly to wheat and dairy, so ever since then I've been trying my hardest to minimize my consumption.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Against the advice of every nutritionist I've ever spoken with, I'm not a big breakfast person.

I'm pretty sure I spend half my paycheck there, but frankly the food is so good that I'm willing to go bankrupt for it. Dinner is a little tougher since my husband is the kind of guy who can eat everything and anything. My willpower is weak, so if he suggests pasta or pizza, I usually cave.  Most of the time I try to make food that I can easily add gluten-free substitutes, like burgers with sprouted-grain buns and soy cheese. For snacks, I'm a devoted acolyte of kale chips.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Being around people who aren't gluten-free. When I go out with friends, I can't just go to any old restaurant \u2014 I have to make sure the place we are going has gluten-free options. I'm also the most hated person at my friend's monthly potluck dinners as no one seems to share my devotion to sweet potatoes and quinoa.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I've never been a 'healthy' eater, so there's a smug sense of satisfaction I get from being a good eater for once in my life. Selfish and self-involved, but true.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt;\n\"I haven't felt this healthy in years. Usually when I eat a big meal, I feel weighed down and uncomfortably full. When I eat gluten-free, I feel satiated without feeling puffed up or gross. It's also had a great effect on my weight \u2014 I used to be about 15 lbs. heavier, but after cutting out gluten and dairy and reducing my sugar intake, I've lost all the stubborn weight that I never seemed able to shake before. As a long-time migraine sufferer, I definitely see a difference in the frequency of my headaches. They're not gone, but they're definitely not occurring as much as they used to. I notice the difference most whenever I 'accidentally' eat wheat \u2014 I wind up feeling bloated, heavy, and all-around yuck.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever cheat?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Yes, at least once or twice a week. As I said, my willpower is weak, so if someone tempts me with gluten foods, I usually end up caving. That's why I try to remove myself from those situations, so I don't set myself up for failure.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u00a0gluten\u00a0food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Pizza and pie. Pizza has everything that's bad for my system \u2014 gluten, dairy, and grease \u2014 but the very thought of a slice of pepperoni is making me drool as I type this. And I have never turned down a slice of raspberry pie in my 29 years of existence, nor do I ever intend on doing so. If you deprive yourself of what makes you happy and take the joy out of food, how can you ever feel good about your choices?\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of advice would you offer to anyone who is considering\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDefinitely try it first before you say it's not for you. Only after cutting it out did I realize that there were some health issues I was having that I didn't even know about. And don't berate yourself if you slip up now and then. You have to be realistic about the fact that this is a major life change and there will be the occasional cheat.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your favorite\u00a0gluten-free brands\/foods?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Macaroni and cheese is pretty much one of my major food groups, so &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amys.com\/products\/product-detail\/entrees\/000043\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Amy's Organic Rice Macaroni and Dairy-Free Cheeze&lt;\/a&gt; is a weekly treat for me.

Never be afraid to ask your waiter if something is okay for you to eat as most places train their staff on how to deal with gluten-free requests. Remember: You're not being difficult or high-maintenance; you have a dietary restriction and that should never be a problem for a restaurant to accommodate.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"People tend to get very defensive when you talk about gluten-free and I really don't know why. Don't take other people's health choices so personally. If you're not down with gluten-free, that's fine, but don't tell people they are wrong for making a life choice that they think is right for them. You need to do what's healthy and right for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;\/em&gt; body and let other people decide what's right for them.

Dinner is whatever I have in my fridge. I don't use many\u00a0gluten-free substitutes \u2014 I typically just eat things that naturally don't have\u00a0gluten.

After seeing what felt like a hundred different doctors, the only solution I was hearing was to go on daily (and pretty intense) medication. I'm a total pill-phobe (taking Advil is a big deal for me), so I decided to go the homeopathic route and see if changing my diet would make a difference.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"For breakfast, I'll have\u00a0gluten-free cereal (corn flakes or Nature's Path Crunch Vanilla Sunrise) and milk or peanut butter on toasted millet bread (you\u00a0have\u00a0to toast it!). Lunch is anything from a homemade\u00a0gluten-free pasta salad with chicken, beans, and veggies to a frozen meal from Amy's \u2014 I go for their brown rice and veggies and their\u00a0gluten-free mac and cheese is YUM. For dinner, I usually have an omelet with feta cheese and broccoli and sometimes I'll add in a slice of millet bread. In between (I'm a snacker!), I eat a lot of fruit and, depending on the day, I'll munch on almonds, those little Babybel cheeses, carrots and hummus, or hardboiled eggs.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the hardest thing about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"The hardest thing is definitely eating with friends \u2014 either at restaurants or at dinner parties \u2014 because it's never fun to be that girl who has to ask the waiter fifty-seven questions about each item on the menu, and when someone prepares a meal for you, it feels really rude to ask a ton of questions or have to refuse the meal because it has\u00a0gluten\u00a0in it. Whomp.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you like about being\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I like that it sort of forces you to eat healthier. Now, I tend to gravitate more towards whole foods like veggies, fruit, beans, meat, etc. and foods with recognizable ingredients because I don't have to worry that\u00a0gluten\u00a0is hiding in there somewhere.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed a difference in your health or the way you feel since going\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;br&gt;\n\"Funnily enough, when I went\u00a0gluten-free for nine months, it did not help my migraines. It turns out that sugar is my biggest trigger, but because most things with\u00a0gluten also have sugar, I end up being\u00a0gluten-free by default. And, like I said earlier, I think it forces me to eat healthier, which is always a good thing.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever cheat?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"I do in fact cheat, thank you for asking! Honestly, I cheat more with sugar than I do with\u00a0gluten\u00a0because I've found so many\u00a0gluten-free substitutes for the foods I love, but when I do, it's usually with a piece of bread at a restaurant or a tempting dessert.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u00a0gluten\u00a0food do you miss the most?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"Crusty-on-the-outside, soft-and-chewy-on-the-inside fresh-baked bread. I've found really good\u00a0gluten-free substitutes for pretty much everything else I love, but no matter how much I enjoy millet bread (and I really do), it's a totally different consistency than the kind of fresh-from-the-oven bread that is just heaven on its own.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of advice would you offer to anyone who is considering\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I would say that it's important to understand what\u00a0gluten\u00a0is first, so you have a general idea of foods it would likely be in and those it wouldn't \u2014 that makes food shopping oh-so-much easier. Definitely stock up on food since eating out is a bit of a crap shoot. Then, try it for two weeks and see how it goes.

That said, it's obviously important to know what you're putting in your body, so it's a necessary evil. First, I try to weed out what I already know has\u00a0gluten\u00a0in it from the menu \u2014 again, this is why it's helpful to know what\u00a0gluten\u00a0is and the kinds of things it's in. Then, don't assume that your waiter (or even the chef) knows what\u00a0gluten\u00a0is and whether or not it's in a dish. If your waiter clearly doesn't know, just ask how something is prepared or ask if there is any flour, soy, breadcrumbs (more familiar ingredients) involved in the meal. A lot of times,\u00a0gluten\u00a0can pop up in salad dressings, seasonings, and other foods you wouldn't necessarily expect, so you can always just ask for oil and vinegar or ask that your meal is simply prepared without seasonings if the waiter is unsure what the ingredients are.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your tried-and-true gluten-free recipes?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"When I discovered the blog\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/glutenfreegoddess.blogspot.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Gluten\u00a0Free Goddess&lt;\/a&gt;, I pretty much became an addict, so this recipe comes from her genius mind \u2014 both tested and approved by unsuspecting non-GF friends.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Sweet Potato Turkey Enchiladas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n-2 cups of your favorite salsa \u2014 spicy or mild&lt;br&gt;\n-4 cups of cooked free-range organic turkey or chicken, hand torn or shredded&lt;br&gt;\nJuice from 2 fresh limes&lt;br&gt;\nSea salt and ground pepper&lt;br&gt;\n2 cups cooked sweet potato&lt;br&gt;\nPinch of cumin&lt;br&gt;\n2 4-oz. cans chopped roasted green chiles, drained&lt;br&gt;\nLight olive oil, as needed&lt;br&gt;\n12 corn tortillas&lt;br&gt;\n1 cup diced pineapple \u2014 no juice&lt;br&gt;\n1-2 cups shredded Jalape\u00f1o Jack cheese or vegan cheese for non-dairy&lt;br&gt;\nHot red pepper flakes, to taste\"&lt;br&gt;\n\n\"Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.

Top with the diced pineapple and the second can of roasted green chiles. Sprinkle with cheese and red pepper flakes. Bake in a 350\u00baF. oven until the enchiladas are bubbling and heated through, about 30 minutes.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a lot of controversy around the idea that gluten-free is not a healthy lifestyle. What do you have to say about that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I think the important thing to remember in all of this is that everyone's body is different, and we all have different needs. You have to do what works for you. I've never been a proponent of completely cutting out certain foods, but if not eating\u00a0gluten\u00a0makes you feel better, then I say go for it. It's the same thing with meat, sugar, carbs, oregano...whatever! Obviously, you want to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need, but other than that, just listen to your body.\"","credit":null,"clicktracker":"","impressiontracker":"","products":[],"no_pin_it":"0","no_facebook":"0","sizes":{"50x":{"src":"\/\/s2.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/81d\/50x\/528330\/image.jpg"},"75x":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/715\/75x\/528330\/image.jpg"},"100x":{"src":"\/\/s2.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/520\/100x\/528330\/image.jpg"},"150x":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/2a5\/150x\/528330\/image.jpg"},"400x400bm":{"src":"\/\/s1.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/84f\/400x400bm\/528330\/image.jpg"},"720x389":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/9dc\/720x389\/528330\/image.jpg"},"x":{"src":"\/\/s3.r29static.com\/\/bin\/entry\/624\/x\/528330\/image.jpg"}}},{"type":"image","description":"&lt;strong&gt;Gluten-free since:&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0April 2010\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you completely\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2028\"Completely!\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to go\u00a0gluten-free?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"I've got a\u00a0gluten\u00a0intolerance, so I didn't really have too much of a choice.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through a typical day of meals for you on a\u00a0gluten-free diet.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"It's almost like I'm on a permanent no-carb diet.\u00a0 For breakfast, eggs or yogurt, lunch is usually a salad or quinoa, and dinner is something along the same lines.

        While were not ones for fad food trends (sorry, Cookie Diet), theres one popular health-food craze thats taken the R29 offices by storm:
        <strong>
         going gluten-free
        </strong>
        . Whether by choice or medical necessity, many of our staffers have opted to cut the wheat out of their diets and have nothing but praises to sing for it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        According to nutrition expert
        <a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
         Dr. Frank Lipman
        </a>
        , they've got the right idea. Gluten is a hard-to-digest protein that can be found in many grains such as wheat, barley, rye, couscous, bulgur, and spelt. Says Lipman, the grain with the highest gluten content and the one we eat the most of, by far, is wheat.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And what, pray tell, is so bad about gluten? In moderation, it's perfectly acceptable for the average person, but many people either eat too much of it, or have an underlying sensitivity to it. "The majority of patients who are intolerant to these grains have a non-celiac gluten sensitivity," says Lipman. "The reaction to gluten creates inflammation throughout the body, with wide-ranging effects across all organ systems including your brain, heart, joints, digestive tract, and more.
        <strong>
         The majority of people who have a gluten sensitivity suffer chronically from a vague unwellness, which doctors dont diagnose
        </strong>
        ."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Dr. Lipman also says that
        <strong>
         gluten sensitivity has been linked to a wide range of health woes
        </strong>
        , including fatigue, aches and pains, weight gain, recurrent canker sores, neurological symptoms, nausea, bloating, constipation, rashes, and even infertility. Upon cutting out gluten, Lipman says many of his patients' issues gradually cleared up and they lost that vague feeling of unwellness that plagued many of them for most of their lives.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Worth noting: One downside to cutting out gluten is that you may see a dip in your fiber intake, but he says it's easy to supplement that loss by adding other fiber-rich foods to your diet.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So, how do you tell if you're one of those (not-so) lucky individuals with a gluten sensitivity? Lipman says you have to cut it out first in order to discover if you've got issues. "After eliminating gluten, if you eat it again, you may have a more pronounced initial response," he says. "This can be helpful information because you will be able to see if you're sensitive to gluten. The spectrum of sensitivity really varies from person to person  it's not all-or-nothing. Don't get stressed about the decision. Treat this as an experiment for two weeks, and if you feel much better you can stick with it for longer."
