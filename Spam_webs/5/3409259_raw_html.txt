         DYSGRAPHIA (PROBLEMS 

              WITH WRITING)
        </h1>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         Dysgraphia is a difficulty writing coherently, 

              if at all, regardless of ability to read. People with dysgraphia 

              often can write, and may have a higher than average IQ, but lack 

              co-ordination, and may find other fine motor tasks such as tying 

              shoes difficult, although it often does not affect all fine motor 

              skills. They can also lack basic spelling skills (having difficulties 

              with p,q,b,d), and often will write the wrong word when trying to 

              formulate thoughts (on paper).
        </p>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         <br/>
         In children, the disorder generally emerges when they are first 

              introduced to writing. They make inappropriately sized and spaced 

              letters, or write wrong or misspelled words despite thorough instruction. 

              Children with the disorder may have other learning disabilities; 

              however, they usually have no social or other academic problems. 

              Cases of dysgraphia in adults generally occur after some neurological 

              trauma or it might be diagnosed in a person with autism, Aspergers 

              Syndrome,

        <p class="bodycopy">
         <br/>
         The DSM IV identifies dysgraphia as a Disorder of Written Expression 

              as writing skills (that) ...are substantially below those expected 

              given the persons ...age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate 

              education.

         Dyslexic dysgraphia

        <p class="bodycopy">
         With dyslexic dysgraphia, spontaneously written 

              work is illegible, copied work is fairly good, and spelling is bad. 

              Finger tapping speed (a method for identifying fine motor problems) 

              is normal, indicating the deficit does not likely stem from cerebellar 

              damage. A Dyslexic Dysgraphic does not necessarily have

        <h3>
         Motor dysgraphia
        </h3>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         Dysgraphia is due to deficient fine motor skills, 

              poor dexterity, poor muscle tone, and/or unspecified motor clumsiness. 

              Generally, written work is poor to illegible, even if copied by 

              sight from another document. Letter formation may be acceptable 

              in very short samples of writing, but this requires extreme effort 

              and an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish, and cannot be 

              sustained for a significant length of time. Spelling skills are 

              not impaired. Finger tapping speed results are below normal.

              of space has illegible spontaneously written work, illegible copied 

              work, normal spelling, but normal tapping speed.

         Some children may have a combination of any two or all three of 

              these. Symptoms in actuality may vary in presentation from what

        <h2>
         Symptoms of dysgraphia
        </h2>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         A mixture of upper/lower case letters, irregular 

              letter sizes and shapes, unfinished letters, struggle to use writing 

              as a communications tool, odd writing grip, many spelling mistakes 

              (sometimes), pain when writing, decreased or increased speed of 

              writing and copying, talks to self while writing, and general illegibility. 

              Reluctance or refusal to complete writing tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         <br/>
         Many people who are dysgraphic will experience pain while writing. 

              The pain usually starts in the center of the forearm and then spreads 

              along the nervous system to the entire body. This pain can get worse 

              or even appear when a dysgraphic is stressed. Few people who do 

              not have dysgraphia know about this, because many with dysgraphia 

              will not mention it to anyone. This may be because they think pain 

              in normal when writing, or that people wont believe them.

        <h2>
         Treatment of dysgraphia
        </h2>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         Treatment for dysgraphia varies and may include 

              treatment for motor disorders to help control writing movements. 

              Other treatments may address impaired memory or other neurological 

              problems. Some physicians recommend that individuals with dysgraphia 

              use computers to avoid the problems of handwriting.
        </p>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         <br/>
         Occupational therapy should be considered to correct an inefficient 

              pencil grasp, strengthen muscle tone, improve dexterity, and evaluate 

              eye-hand coordination. Dysgraphic children should also be evaluated 

              for ambidexterity, which can delay fine motor skills in early childhood.

        <h2>
         Vision therapy
        </h2>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         People who struggle with symptoms of dysgraphia 

              usually benefit from vision therapy. Seventy percent of what a child 

              learns in school is processed through the visual system. Even a 

              minor visual processing problem will interfere with a child or adult 

              performing to their potential and could cause symptoms of dysgraphia.
        </p>
        <p class="bodycopy">
        </p>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         Symptoms of vision problems include:
         <br/>
          Avoidance of near work
         <br/>
          Frequent loss of place
         <br/>
          Omission, insertion, or rereading of letters and words
         <br/>
          Confusion with similar looking words
         <br/>
          Failure to recognize the same word in the next sentence.
        </p>
        <p class="bodycopy">
         <br/>
         Any struggling student should have a complete evaluation by a behavioral 

              optometrist. Testing should be done at distance and nearpoint to 

              assure that both eyes are working together as a team. Vision is 

              more than clarity, and is a complex combination of learned skills, 

              including tracking, fixation, focus change, binocular fusion and 

              visualization. When all of these are well developed, children and 

              adults can sustain attention, read and write without careless errors, 

              give meaning to what they hear and see, and rely less on movement 

              to stay alert.
