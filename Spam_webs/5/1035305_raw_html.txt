      Jess Holzworth
     </b>
     s work might best be described as Folk Metal - it is a visual study on rebellion. With a mythical punk aesthetic and a magical vision, Holzworth's collages evoke the innocent optimism of free love and high times. Freedom, censorship, and humor exist outside of convention and float freely through lines, dots, and squares of day-glow fluorescent colors.

As the founder of Angelblood, the artist recorded three experimental albums, two released by Captain Trip Records in Japan and one by Thurston Moores label Ecstatic Peace. In 2000, the artist collaborated with Lizzi Bougatsos on an eclectic series of video, photography and collage in an installation entitled "Boug &amp; Worth, Fuck All Our Art Heroes/Assholes" and "Boug &amp; Worth II", both exhibited at Colin DeLand's legendary American Fine Arts, Co. in Soho. Most recently, the artist has directed music videos for Beck's Gamma Ray, Basement Jaxx's, "Raindrops", Imaad Wasif's, "Redeemer", and The Slits, "Lazy Slam.

      Wes Lang
     </b>
     professes a sometimes veiled reverence for life through his tattoo-inspired imagery. Combining the same deft maneuvers of brush as he has long-employed with the skin-artists needle, Lang translates masculine tattoo templates and works from within the confines of stylized graphics of flash art. With the keenest eye toward our ephemeral fringe  Lang champions human faults, celebrating the patterns in our rapaciousness  a familiar vernacular comfort becomes the voice of longing for a world without anchor. Dancing through the bone-yard of Americas tattered narrative, Lang embraces both the darkness visible in gallows humor and the risky taunting of viewers in the face of their own taboos.

     Concerned with the contemporary American landscape and the role "language" plays, explicit and implicit, within this contextual framework,
     <b>
      Michael Phelan
     </b>
     's work critically investigates how historically specific models and cultural traditions have been absorbed, co-opted, and repurposed to fit the needs of the popular (Western and Global) commercial marketplace. Employing art historical and mass media references, his work re-contextualizes/positions mundane and disparate icons of consumer culture with an eye towards both art history and the legacy of Middle America "life-styling" within a postmodern aestheticized landscape. Re-positioned and repurposed, these historical/cultural models call into question how "history", once unhinged from its original contexts, can be reconstituted, redistributed and reabsorbed into the American landscape.

      Aaron Spangler's
     </b>
     carved wood bas-relief sculpture To The Valley Below celebrates the peace, beauty, idealism, and magic of the undomesticated life off the grid, which has often become the destination of many in the hippie movement following wartime. A prominent Barn Owl, which is known to actively hunt for prey only under the cover of darkness, seems to beckon the viewer back to the land and its groves in search of a simpler way of living.
