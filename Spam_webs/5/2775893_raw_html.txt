      What is E

     </h1>
     There actually are 4 different but related things called E

     <p>
      E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      is first of all the largest exceptional 
root system, which is
a set of vectors in an 8-dimensional real vector space satisfying
certain properties.
Root systems were classified by Wilhelm Killing in the 1890s. He 
found 4 infinite classes of Lie algebras, labelled

      , and D
      <sub>
       n
      </sub>
      , where n=1,2,3....
He also found 5 more
      <em>
       exceptional
      </em>
      ones: 
G

      , F

      , E

      </sub>
      , E
      <sub>

      , and
E
      <sub>

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      root system consists of all vectors (called roots)
(a

      </sub>
      ,a
      <sub>

      )
where all a
      <sub>
       i
      </sub>
      are integers or all   a
      <sub>
       i
      </sub>
      are integers plus 1/2, 
the sum is an even integer, and 
sum of the squares is 2. An example with all integers is (-1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0) (there are 112
of these) and an example with half-integers is (1/2,1/2,-1/2,-1/2,-1/2,1/2,1/2,-1/2) (there are 128 of
these). E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      has 240 roots. The 8 refers to the fact that
there are 8 coordinates.
See
      <a href="mcmullen.html">
       a picture of the E
       <sub>
        8
       </sub>
       root system
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Secondly E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      refers to the
      <em>
       root lattice
      </em>
      obtained by
taking all sums (with integral coefficients) of the vectors in the
root system. It consists of all vectors above with all a
      <sub>
       i
      </sub>
      integers, or all a
      <sub>
       i
      </sub>
      integers plus 1/2, and whose sum is
even.
The integers of squared length 2 are precisely the roots.
This lattice, sometimes called the "8-dimensional diamond lattice",
has a number of remarkable properties. It
gives most efficient sphere-packing in 8 dimensions, and is also the
unique
      <em>
       even, unimodular
      </em>
      lattice in 8 dimensions. This latter
property makes it important in

      Next E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      is a semisimple Lie algebra.
A Lie algebra is a vector space, equipped with an operation called the
Lie bracket. A simple example is the set of all 2 by 2 matrices. This
is a 4-dimensional vector space. The Lie bracket operation is
[X,Y]=XY-YX.
     </p>
     <p>
      E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      is a 248-dimensional Lie algebra. Start with the 8
coordinates above, and add a coordinate for each of the 240 roots of
the E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      root system. This vector space has an operation on
it, called the
      <em>
       Lie bracket
      </em>
      : if X,Y are in the Lie algebra so
is the Lie bracket [X,Y]. This is like multiplication, except that it
is not commutative. Unlike the example of 2 x 2 matrices,
it is very hard to write down the formula for the
Lie bracket on E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      This is a complex Lie algebra, i.e. the coordinates are complex numbers.
Associated to this Lie algebra is a (complex) Lie group, also called
E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      . This complex group has (complex) dimension 248.
The E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      Lie algebra and group were
studied by Elie Cartan in 1894.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      is one of three real forms of the the complex
Lie group E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      . Each of these three real forms has
      <em>
       real
      </em>
      dimension 248. 
The group which we are referring to in this web site is
the split real form of E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
      .

      Geometric description of the split real form of
E
      <sub>
       8
      </sub>
     </h3>
     Consider 16x16 real matrices X satisfying two conditions. First of all 
X is a rotation matrix, i.e. its rows and columns are
orthonormal. Secondly assume X
     <sup>
      2
     </sup>
     =-I. The set of all such
matrices V
     <sub>
      0
     </sub>
     is a geometric object (a "real algebraic variety"), and it is
56-dimensional. There is a natural way to add a single circle to this
to make a 57-dimensional variety V. (V=Spin(16)/SU(8), and is circle
bundle over V
     <sub>
      0
     </sub>
     , to anyone  keeping score).  Finally E
     <sub>
      8
     </sub>
     is a
group of symmetries ofV.
