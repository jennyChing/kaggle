        <p>
         In a press release issued on November 12, 2013, the human rights organization Peoples Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) stated that between September and October 2013, eight infants had died and many more had been seriously injured after they had received the pentavalent (5-in-1) vaccination.
        </p>
        <p>
         PUDR reported that the pentavalent vaccine, given to infants to protect them from diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, pneumonia-meningitis (Hib) and hepatitis B, had been introduced to Jammu and Kashmir, in India, as part of the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) in February 2013.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Why This Vaccine Should Have Never Been Administered
        </h3>
        <p>
         Their press release stated that immediately following the childrens deaths, a team from the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare in Delhi, headed by Dr. N. K. Arora of INCLEN (International Clinical Epidemiology Network), had visited the village of Srinagar to investigate what had happened. PUDR said that:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         
         <em>
          While the final report of this team is awaited, their preliminary report has already stated that the children have died from causes like septicemia and pneumonia, and are unrelated to the vaccine. This conclusion fails to explain why or how the babies were administered the vaccine in the first place if they were seriously ill at the time of immunization
         </em>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In other words, PUDR had uncovered that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had given their conclusions as to how these children had died before the final reports had even been issued.
        </p>
        <p>
         Disgusted by their discoveries, PUDR decided to investigate for themselves exactly what had happened to these infants. They described with horror what they had uncovered:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          It was in this context that the PUDR, Delhi (Peoples Union for Democratic Rights), put together a team comprising public health experts, including clinicians, to look into these incidents. The team which was in Srinagar between 8th to 10th November, visited some of the affected families and conducted a verbal autopsy of the infant deaths to look for antecedent illnesses as well as enquire about other adverse events (as per the Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI ) guidelines.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          This team came across infants who had developed serious adverse events after the immunization and had been admitted in the childrens hospital in Srinagar.
          <strong>
           It was found that the FIR (First Information Report by a doctor or health worker for reporting AEFI) had been recorded only in the cases of death and not in cases of those infants who survived; in other words FIR was prepared after death of the child and not on admission.
          </strong>
         </em>
         (emphasis added)
        </p>
        <p>
         During their investigations, they discovered that it had taken one family over two hours to reach the hospital and by the time the exhausted family had arrived, their baby had died en route. However, instead of reporting this case as another possible vaccine death, the hospital reported that child had been dead on arrival.
        </p>
        <p>
         PUDR learned that although the FDA does not license the pentavalent vaccine for use in the USA, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), and the Gates Foundation heavily promotes its use in the developing world. [1]

         Ties Discovered to Gates Foundation
        </h3>
        <p>
         So, why is the WHO promoting a dangerous vaccine that is killing children? Maybe it is because the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are funding them to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gates Foundation recently announced that they will be giving the sum of $750 million over five years to help ensure that children in developing countries are immunized against major killer diseases in the new millennium.
        </p>
        <p>
         They said in a press release:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          The fund will work closely with a new international coalition called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), a partnership of international development and finance organizations, philanthropic groups, the pharmaceutical industry and others.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          The GAVI partners, which include the World Health Organization, UNICEF, The World Bank, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Childrens Vaccine Program will use the money for a sustained global vaccination effort to address the challenges facing vaccine development and delivery in developing countries.

        <h3>
         Are These Vaccines Saving Children Or Killing Them?
        </h3>
        <p>
         For many years our governments and mainstream media have led us to believe that organizations such as the WHO, GAVI and the Gates Foundation promote vaccines such as the pentavalent vaccine for use in developing countries to save the lives of millions of children. But are they?
        </p>
        <p>
         Apparently not, according to Truthstream Media, who has recently written an article tiled
         <em>
          Pediatrician Says 5-in-1 Vaccine Pushed by Bill Gates GAVI, WHO Will Kill 3,125 Babies.
         </em>
         The 5-in-1 vaccine, promoted by the Gates Foundation, GAVI, the WHO and UNICEF, has already killed at least 70 children across five developing nations and is on target to kill thousands more. They wrote that:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          According to a recently published editorial in the
         </em>
         Indian Journal of Medical Ethics
         <em>
          by St. Stephens Hospital Head Pediatrician Dr. Jacob Puliyel, thousands more babies are expected to perish for what will be a negligible impact in the supposed campaign to stop disease.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         They stated in their report that Dr. Puliyel had accused WHO of promoting the 5-in-1 vaccination by FALSELY stating that NO adverse event following immunization had ever been reported. [3]
        </p>
        <h3>
         Vaccine Death is Not SIDS
        </h3>
        <p>
         I decided to find out exactly what else Dr. Puliyel had written in his report.
        </p>
        <p>
         I found that his report revealed that several infants had died, soon after vaccination, in every area where the vaccine had been introduced. To cover up this fact, the WHO had come up with various elaborate excuses.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, Dr. Jacob Puliyel had written that none of their excuses were sufficient alternative causes and revealed that whenever a childs death could not be explained, the WHO diagnosed the child as having died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
        </p>
        <p>
         He wrote:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          All sudden deaths in infancy are not cases of SIDS. SIDS by definition is the death of an infant that is not predicted by the medical history, and which is unexplained after a thorough forensic autopsy and detailed investigation of the death scene. There are certain features common to all the deaths discussed in this editorial: the children had received the pentavalent vaccine which in most cases, was followed by a high fever and excessive crying and in some, convulsions before the child died. The use of the term SIDS in a generic manor to describe deaths following vaccination, when the autopsy has suggested hypersensitivity and shock, is misleading and unfortunate.
         </em>
         [4]
        </p>
        <p>
         This is true and it will be very interesting to see how the WHO tries to wriggle out of this factual information.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
         Again, we have strong evidence to suggest that an unlicensed and unsafe vaccination is being given to millions of children in the developing world. Rather than saving their lives, as we have been led to believe that they are, the WHO, GAVI and the Gates Foundation have killed possibly hundreds if not thousands of these vulnerable children with dangerous and unnecessary vaccination programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of these children are already weak and ill. What they need is a clean and safe water supply, better nutrition and a better environment. Why are the Gates Foundation, the WHO and GAVI spending billions of dollars on vaccination programs, when they could provide them with what they really need at a fraction of the cost?

             How upsetting! After all the work of developing the baby for 9 months then all the work to deliver the baby only to have their precious rewards life cut short needlessly. It breaks my heart. Its despicable spending so much money on useless vaccines when clean water nutritious foods would be much more effective. Just think how much water and food could be bought with all those millions that bill and Linda gate will give over the next five years. I think we could then also afford shoes and clothing.

             This story is so sad it makes me sick. The crimes against humanity are now extreme, using these bio-weapons of mass destruction. World Eugenists Organization and Company need to be prosecuted and executed for their crimes starting with the epitome of evil, Bill and Melinda Gates. How do they all get away with impunity for human rights violations is my question.

             Anybody who is still in doubt about vaccines should read Dr Suzanne Humphreys book, Dissolving Illusions, to learn the truth about the real history of vaccines, and how improved living conditions and quality of life are primarily responsible for the decline in infectious diseases, NOT vaccines.

             I say someone needs to tie Bill and Melinda Gates down and inject them with the same vaccines they are forcing on these innocent children.  See what happens to them when they are jabbed with 5 vaccines in one.  Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.

             Dr. Andrew Wakefields message 15 years ago re the MMR was one of simple caution:  until more is known, it might be best to give the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately.  (Also the Urabe scandalUrabe strain of mumps vaccine did injure childrens brains by causing aseptic meningitishad to be hushed up and he was the scapegoat.  Read his book, Callous Disregard, Autism and Vaccines  the Truth Behind a Tragedy (Skyhorse Publishing:  NY 2010)).  And the necessary safety studies have still not been done on the giving of multiple vaccinations at once. (E.g., see Cochrane Review 2012 on MMR:  inadequate safety studies.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Pharma in conjunction with bought-out government agencies, including the CDC in the US, push for multiple vaccines given at one time for efficiency of administration.  For them, Safety is not a higher priority than efficiency.  And with all that scientists are still learning about how the immune system really works, with the involvement of human gut bacteria and their connection to the brain, isnt it time this mad rush to vaccinate all children slowed downuntil more is known, as Dr. Wakefield suggested?  He is, of course, not the only one saying it.

             Allergies and asthma in children are way up.  Vaccines are known to cause allergies and auto-immune diseases.  In fact, the word allergy was first coined to describe adverse effects to vaccination by Clemens von Pirquet. (From Wikipedia:  In 1906 he noticed that patients who had previously received injections of horse serum or smallpox vaccine had quicker, more severe reactions to a second injection. He, along with Bela Schick, coined the word allergy (from the Greek allos meaning other and ergon meaning reaction) to describe this hypersensitivity reaction.

            <p>
             Today, latex allergy is so common, a Home Depot clerk told me they have actually stopped making latex paint. Yet latex is still in many stoppers to vaccine bottles.  Are they testing little babies before vaccinating to rule out latex allergy? That is only one known allergen children are exposed to with vaccines.

             Yes but the stark truth is that the real object of these vaccines is not to make the poor childrens life better; it is to make their lives SHORTER and MUCH less fertile.

             I think there is more to the story. it does say developing countries therefore many babies are dying and do die there needs to be a comparison between the amount of deaths in the years before vaccine introduced and the years after vaccine was introduced and also how many deaths of older children vaccinated compared to non vaccinated. It is vary dangerous to scare parents against vaccines because many of our children have been saved because of them.

             How strange to live in a world where the mainstream is so brainwashed to actually believe vaccines are safe and necessary for good health when evidence of the complete opposite has been mounting body by body, day by day since they were first introduced, its never been clearer or easier to research

             Seriously? Nonsense? Im not an industry shill and I found this comment to be perfectly reasonable .. More so in fact than the article, which makes a whole lot of claims and doesnt provide a whole lot of evidence. My gut reaction to your comment sounds a bit like your comment: only an anti-vax airhead could write this nonsense.

             Bill Gates father, a know eugenics was a past president of Planned Parenthood who origins are nefarious and sinister.  Bill Gates states he doesnt feel the same way his father did but just look at the activities hes engaged in.  Hes doing the exactly same thing the Rockefeller Foundation who ha been funding this sort of activities for decades.  The Rockefellers also funded the Nazis.  Even though the Eugenics movement began in the US the Germans took it to a whole new level because the US was moving too slow in their opinion.

             Many doctors wont admit it, but while they tell you you need to vaccinate your child, they themselves do not vaccinate their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             They officially tell you that there is no evidence that vaccination causes any harm, because they refuse to take into account the thousands of instances of anecdotal evidence that is available.   What WE AS PARENTS know happened to our child/ren after vaccination was not proven in a clinical study, and apparently we dont count :(

             It is very dangerous to scare parents against vaccines ?.. many of our children have been saved because of them?
            </p>
            <p>
             Vaccines have not saved any lives, and if you have proof or numbers of lives saved by vaccines, you can provide that data to support your comment. I have yet to see hard data from any vaccine propagandist with regard to lives saved by vaccines. Where are these numbers that nobody has ever seen?
            </p>
            <p>
             The fear mongering of parents belongs to the vaccine industry who claim, like you, that not vaccinating is dangerous, and that vaccines save lives. These vaccine propagandist use every fear mongering tactic to scare unsuspecting parents and people into submitting to this diabolical practice.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its high time sites like this one and others come to the peoples aid with education regards the truth about vaccines and the REAL history of vaccines, so that they are made fully aware of the serious and deadly risks they take when submitting self or their children to this very dangerous, deadly, and unproven science experiment, with no benefits whatsoever.

In  2005,  Cochrane  published  a safety review of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR).

             -In the Conclusions  the reviewers stated: The safety record of MMR is possibly best attested by its almost universal use. So having set out to ascertain whether the millions of doses of MMR vaccine administered worldwide are safe the authors of this review claim they are safe because millions of doses are administered worldwide. That is not science, nor is it based on the evidence in the review.The reviewers also said:The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.
             <br/>
             We found problematic internal validity and biases influenced our confidence in their findings. Not all reports offered adequate explanations for missing data. External validity of included studies was also low. Descriptions of populations, response rates vaccine content and exposure were poorly and inconsistently reported.  Inadequate and inconsistent descriptions of reported outcomes limited observation periods selective reporting of results contributed to our decision not to attempt pooling data by study design. There are other unusual aspects of the widely reported Cochrane MMR review synopsis statement: No credible evidence of an involvement of MMR with either autism or
             <br/>
             Crohns disease was found. This statement leaves the Wakefield hypothesis open and untouched. Involvement  is not a usual word in this
             <br/>
             context. Even elementary texts teach that where the cause is
             <br/>
             unknown, epidemiological investigations principally look for associations  between disease and potential causes. The use of involvement instead of association in a paper by such experienced reviewers implies the authors were unwilling to disclaim that evidence of an association existed. The claim that  no credible evidence was found  is a statement about the quality of the evidence then available and considered by the
             <br/>
             reviewers. It leaves open that credible evidence may be found in the many avenues of investigation that remain ignored and unexplored by establishment researchers. The reviewers also appear not to have taken into account the Bradford Hill guidelines. Their statement is based on three cohort, two case-control, and one self-controlled trial study. No
             <br/>
             other evidence such as clinical or dechallenge or rechallenge evidence appears to have been considered. Over reliance on epidemiological statistical significance testing is inappropriate.

             Contrary to its conclusions, the body of the 2005 Cochrane MMR review confirms the statements made by one of its authors, Dr. Thomas
             <br/>
             Jefferson, in 2002. When head of the vaccine division of the
             <br/>
             Cochrane Collaboration and board member of EUSAFEVAC, Jefferson was quoted as saying:Most safety studies on childhood vaccines have not been conducted thoroughly enough to tell whether the jabs cause side effects [T]he issue was the Cinderella of public health research and Government officials had failed to make it a high priority.  There is some good research, but it is overwhelmed by the bad. The public has been let down because the proper studies have not been done.
            </p>
            <p>
             [T]here was a dearth of sound studies on the risks and benefits.  Information available on the safety of vaccines that are routinely given to babies and toddlers was simply inadequate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Conclusion:
             <br/>
             The independence of The Cochrane Collaboration, which had been called into question previously, has been further compromised by recent funding changes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The conclusions of the Cochrane review on the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccine violate the standards of evidence-based medicine and are not supported by the body of the review. There are material concerns that the conclusions were influenced by efforts of the British government to avoid liability in claims brought on behalf of allegedly vaccine-injured children.

             Extract of the Abstract:-
             <br/>
             The conclusions of the Cochrane MMR review are not
             <br/>
             supported by, and contradict, the evidence presented in the review. Having found inadequate evidence of safety in the papers studied, the reviews conclusion that the millions of doses of MMR vaccine administered worldwide are safe is not science based. It is based on the circular assertion without cited evidence that the vaccine is safe because millions of doses are administered. The
             <br/>
             review also shows that studies into the extent of the adverse effects are too limited to say how extensive these adverse effects may be, and consequently to say whether the vaccine is safe. The review provides no comparative evaluation of MMR vaccine safety and effectiveness against other measures, such as single vaccines, placebo, no vaccine, or modern treatment options. It provides no evidence to refute the Wakefield hypothesis of an association between MMR vaccine, regressive autism following previously normal development, and a novel
             <br/>
             form of inflammatory bowel disease.

             The Cochrane review duplicates an almost identical paper published in 2003 by members of the same team, yet contains no reference to the earlier paper. According to a separate publication by one of the authors, duplicated publication can be considered unethical or fraudulent when the authors attempt to conceal the existence of duplicated publication from editors and readers.

             Merck paid for the Cochrane Study.  They wanted a study, probably to support the Thoreson study aka the Danish study because of the information that came out in 2000 at the Simpsonwood conference.   The Cochrane study is so flawed and bias that its not worth using in a debate.  People bring this up as much as the Thorsen MMR study aka know as the Danish Study not realizing how they are bought and paid for by the industry.  Merck paid for the Cochrane Study and the CDC paid for the Thorsen Study. Merck wanted a study but not one based on actual research data so they didnt provide the data Cochrane requested.  apparently there is a timing factor when studies are done so to stay within the designated time frame, Cochrane went with what they had.  Cochrane stated it was a crap study based on crappy data but its the best crappy study there is.  I guess they were annoyed because they knew they would lose creditability based on their conflict of interest and not providing a well done study.

             Vaccines are not safe in any way shape of form because they are inherently contaminated.  Read Janine Roberts book: Fear of the Invisible.  She states:
             <br/>
             -Our vaccines, I thus learnt, are not filtered clean but are suspensions from the manufacturers incubation tanks in which the viruses are produced from substrates of mashed bird embryo, minced monkey kidneys or cloned human cells. These suspensions are filtered before use but only to remove particles larger than viruses. The point of the vaccine is that it contains viruses, thus these must not be filtered out. This means there remains in the vaccine everything of the same size or smaller, including what the manufacturers call degradation products  parts of decayed viruses or cells.

             Well, its hard to quantify prevention. So you have to look at disease morbidity and mortality since the introduction of vaccines. So while the causes of the decline of vaccine-preventable diseases is multi-factorial, its outright stupid to deny that they havent been THE major factor. Especially since we see vaccine-preventable diseases return after vaccination rates decrease. If you cant find this information yourself, then youre not looking. Because I seem to find anti-vaccine, scare-mongering propaganda quite easily even though Im pro-science.

             Umthey dont support depopulation. They support vaccination which increases life expectancy. And we now sociologically, that when life expectancy increases, birth rates go down. Hence, population stress on the environment and economies in sub-Saharan African and other poor areas will be reduced creating the grounds for growth and success.

             The UN has developed ingredients that are patented to induce lifetime infertility. These ingredients were added to a tetanus vaccine distributed to mothers in the Philippines. Note the brave UN was not concerned in giving this  tetanus vaccine to men and boys. I guess men dont get tetanus in the Philippines. So you can see this infertility technique needs some work.

             This crap is IMO in the seasonal flu vaccine, in select batches of course. It can be in any vaccine coming out of China.

             There are only two things sustaining the horrors of vaccination.
            </p>
            <p>
             1 FEAR
            </p>
            <p>
             2 AUTHORITY
            </p>
            <p>
             It is the authorities who induce fear in us causing us to vaccinate.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the evidence SCREAMS do NOT VACCINATE.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon the authorities will have to FORCE us, by force of arms, to vaccinate. Believe it or not this is often the step seen before vaccination is ENDED. So cheer up folks.

             Yes this appears to be the reason for the outbreak of peanut allergy; first in infants and no one else; then in infants and young children and no one else; then in infants, young children, older children and no one else then ,,,. I am surprised the CDC has not done genetic research on this. LOL! It is quite a strange phenomena no? One thing we can be sure of it is NOT linked to vaccination. For proof see all the studies on vaccination and autism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vaccination in general seems to be inducing all sorts of allergies. Allergy is often a disease of vaccination IMO.

             First we got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. Thats headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. -Bill Gates
            </p>
            <p>
             If vaccination (along with health care and reproductive health services) increase life expectancy, why would Gates expect projected population of 9 billion to be lowered by 10 or 15 percent?  Shouldnt these things increase global population?

             Well its hard to provide that other than the fact a child is alive. I see plenty of children who were not vaccinated get sick badly because they werent vaccinated and Ive seen many children get sick because they were vaccinated, but to ask for proof of children who survived because of a vaccine is kind of stupid. For all I know a vaccine that I gave my daughter saved her life. Ill never know, but I DO know that she IS alive and very healthy.

             Go to any old cemeteries and count the gravestones of kids who didnt
             <br/>
             reach the age of 10 prior 1950s-60s. Then do the same for gravestones
             <br/>
             after 1960s (where population had since doubled)  Then ask yrself why
             <br/>
             there are so much fewer in modern times. Why? of course the evil modern
             <br/>
             medical establishment has been removing those modern gravestones.

             Cleanliness has nothing to do with the spread of diptheria, polio, whooping cough, measles. Whilst it is true that improving 3rd world would hygiene wld save lives, vaccination does an UNDENIABLE bloody good job. Unfortunately it is a bit harder to absorb the TRUTH. (

             By Jim Bobs logic, if vaccines increase life expectancy then todays youngest members should have very long lives to look forward to given the massive slew of vaccines been shot into them What a pathetic joke given the appalling state of  todays chronically sick youngsters.

             Hi Amanda, this is precisely why transparent long-term studies are required to compare the long-term health of the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated.   Unofficial surveys strongly suggest that the vaccinated are significantly more prone to allergies, asthma, autism, learning disorders, diabetes, SIDS, auto-immune conditions etc.   Far too many parents have been dealt a vaccine damaged child and go on to see how much healthier their following unvaccinated child/children are for this question to be continually avoided by officialdom.  *** Given the troubling impact that vaccines have on the blood-brain barrier of the developing infant, their synergistic toxicity, demyelination, bypassing the critical frontier barriers of the immune system, its high time this outdated modality were put under the investigative microscope. Thanks for listening.

             Hi Lisa, so true what youve said about the appalling state of dismissal and denial. Ultimately, it is not what some white coat in his insular ivory tower decrees that counts but what is happening in the human body.

             Yes. I explained this concept above. Birth rate and life expectancy are two different things. As a I said, if you look at any country where life expectancy is high, youll find birth rates will be lower. In fact, all G7 countries have low birth rates and only increase their population through immigration.
             <br/>
             Ergo, you wont have population explosions in places like sub-Saharan Africa or other poor places where life expectancy is around the mid-30s. Its not a hard concept to grasp.
             <br/>
             Gates wasnt saying that new vaccines, health care and reproductive services are going to murder 15 percent of the population, he was saying the birth rates would be drastically lowered because of sociological reasons when life expectancy increases.

             Yup! You got it! Life expectancy has skyrocketed over the past 100 hundred years. Vaccines are a large part of that. The human race is healthier then ever.

             That study is 25 years old. And it is talking about a vaccine for fertility treatment for cancer patients.

             Do you read the stuff you post?
             <br/>
             Moreover, thats not whats being given as a vaccine.

             What a joke, and I quote from your own reference:
            </p>
            <p>
             The Department of Health notes no unusual increase in abortions since 1990, the year the anti-tetanus drive was accelerated. Previous to that, anti-tetanus vaccination in the country has been going on since 1983.
             <br/>
             Ergo, no fertility issues.
             <br/>
             Also, youre point about men is moot, since the article is dealing with tetanus transferred to pregnant women.
             <br/>
             Again I ask, do you read the stuff you post?

             I think I mentioned this back when that article was written. But I believe there have been around 7 million doses of the HPV given and she found 1 case of OPF. The only association to vaccination was temporal. No causal mechanism and no other cases identified. That was a poor article based of even poorer research.

             So the only people they asked for comments in that article were known anti-vaccine advocates. Perhaps a medical professional would have been useful. Like a virologist or and epidemiologist.

             <br/>
             insect that is subjected to a soup of untold microbes would
             <br/>

             Yes great point Lou but I sometimes supsect it may also be a combination of vaccines and our modern day agricultural practices playing a role in allegies/intolerances too.  The manipulation of wheat,fruit and vegetable seeds turned into either GMO or hybrid versions which then become man made processed products and not what nature intended.  End result? =The food becomes inferior nutrient wise leading to deficiency disease.  On top of that we are also exposed to a lot more chemicals today.  The list is endless.  *Sigh* What a topsy turvey world we live in!

Of both the earth and our bodies. Destroying both with his ignorant views. All for money. It really is at the root of all evil

             I was referring to clean drinking water and quality food. Vaccine industry is opportunistic. They saw a way to make mega bucks and shut off their consciences leaving their morals and ethics behind. What makes up a man? What does he require to repair the systems of his body at a cellular level? Surely chemistry 101 wouldnt say vaccines or drugs. Its just a way to prey upon peoples fear (spread by the industry) and ignorance

             As someone who lost a son to the DPT vaccine,  I fully
             <br/>
             sympathize and concur with your comments.    I was
             <br/>
             stonewalled by the medical system and have met SO many others whose vaccine killed or injured chid was written off
             <br/>
             as a coincidental casualty.   Its beyond disgusting what
             <br/>
             my child and many thousands of others have endured at
             <br/>
             the hands of fear rmongering medical fanatics bullying
             <br/>
             parents into inoculating their children.   There is no justice
             <br/>
             for the vaccine damaged.    To have to deal with scorn
             <br/>
             and ignorance of fellows like this one, is added insult

             I mean to say the food we and other animals eat should come from plants grown in good quality dirt since we cant just eat dirt. Though doctors used to tell mothers of children who were pica on lead paint to let their children play in and eat the dirt. Much wiser than injecting the little ones with toxic foreign substances.

             While academics argue (flawed, biased) data, attack others and such, while drug companies dictate/buy policy, the rest of us can trust the HUGE mountain of evidence and our God given instincts that vaccines are neither safe nor necessary for good health; however there is NO true choice without full disclosure and informed consent.

             I chose not to take his comment personally as it wasnt about me, it was HIS reaction reflecting HIS limited mind/reality, I honestly feel bad for his lack of self awareness to see that. I try to avoid labels but I think they call them haters, theyre looking for a reaction, its usually best to ignore.

             Thank you, Barb.   As they say the proof is in the pudding
             <br/>
             but the tragedy remains that most are still so ingrained
             <br/>
             by vaccine brainwashing that they only wake up to
             <br/>
             vaccine deceptions after the damage is done.
             <br/>
             At least my husband and I are blessed that our subsequent children have never been inoculated and are SO healthy (unlike the kids they attend school with).  We woke up
             <br/>
             too late for our first child but at least we can find some
             <br/>
             comfort in knowing weve spare our other children toxic
             <br/>
             inoculations allowing them their God given right to true health.

             You managed to use to logical fallacies in that short reply. Very impressive.
             <br/>
             Btw the disease that vaccines have take credit for, like poilio and measles had a pretty much non existent beath rate of around 1:100,000. Even if there were a lot of kids that died pre vaccination age, they would have had to die from something vaccines dont even claim to prevent.

             Go watch his TED speech, he clearly states the world is over populated and if we do a really  good good job with vaccines and health care we can reduce that by 10 or 15% Its hard to swing that into anything but pro depopulation and being that his foundation is pushing vaccines across the 3rd world, he is not just talking about those beliefs.

             Thanks josh. Its true talking to people who only valuemoney and power is a waste of time. Closed minded. Yet perhaps it could help someone who may not be commited to going vaccine free though they fear the potential side effects to think.

             Yea but jim isnt one of them. He is either a paid shill or someone that is just not willing to breakaway from the herb mentality and group think and will never accept any evidence that is contrary to their world view.
             <br/>
             I do agree that its important to try to encourage the people who want to go vaccine free. When I talk to people like jim, and bring light on the dangers and ineffectiveness of vaccines and the allopathic industry, or show how the natural approach is safer and more effective; Im not really talking to jim because he is not really going to look at the info with an open mind because his mind is made up and nothing will change this, but it may open up others  to the truth.

             Scary yet most Americans view him as a great humanitarian.  If you criticize Gates on sites such as HP or Raw people will attack you and tell you how great he.  When I tell them the great one lost a discrimination lawsuit filed by his Black employees for treating them and other minorities with a plantation mentality as quoted by the judge that presided over the case. I am so appalled by the lack of knowledge people have for what is actually going on not only in this country but the world.  If you say anything out side of the corporate orchestrated facade of the medical industry, Auto industry, the Rockefeller Foundation, Gates Foundation etc.  people flip out.  Yet they cant counter any of the verifiable information with other than youre a liar.  Im tired of the American people especially those who live in fear dictating the course of the country.  Prime example is the vaccine apologist and pro-vaccine people who so terrorized by the idea that someone may catch a cold, meseals, chicken pox-all illness that billions of people over the course of time have survived.  They have brought into the fear mongering and someone always has a story of I know someone who died from meseals when I was growing up.  Really?  Im sure people know someone who died in a car accident does that mean you will never drive again or ride in a moving vehicle?

             According to the Life Expectancy chart put out by the CIA, in 2007 American was 47th on the list.  2012 America is not 147th.  Hell of a drop and since this chart is based on infant mortality-someone isnt right.  Sorry for the rant.

             Some people will never be able to break away from the herb mentality and group think. They will always by into the propaganda just because its popular or the excepted view in the mainstream scientific community. They wont even truly look into anything yet they will insult those who have. You are right you cant say anything about Gate without getting crucified.

             Fear is a great motivator and they use it a lot. The example you use is a perfect example. You will inform them that highly toxic substances will never prevent or cure any ailment, and they are of course very dangerous. They will use you saying that something toxic is bad for the body as you fear mongering. One guy actually told me to grow up after I said we shouldnt be putting these substances in our bodies. Using the fact that these substances are already polluting the air water and food supply, like that makes it ok and smart to add more to problem.

             While its no consolation, go to the NVICP and claim your compensation. You barely have to show evidence if the reaction is a table injury.
             <br/>
             Unless of course, if its just your belief that vaccines caused it and your doctors have said otherwise you are going to have a difficult time.
             <br/>
             PS. There is justice for vaccine injuries through NVCIP.

             Just because you cant wrap your mind around it, it doesnt make it false. And your faulty assumptions are hilarious. Just because people have more time to procreate, doesnt mean theyre going around doing it like rabbits.
             <br/>
             Picture this: In my country (Canada), on average, every woman will have 1.5 kids. Most will live to around 75 years of age. Where as in Uganda, every woman will have approximately 7 kids. But most will only live until 55 years old. More to the point, your having more time to procreate argument is moot, since both groups experience the same number of child rearing years.
             <br/>
             Also Look at any country with a high life expectancy and youll find low birth rate. Moreover, youll notice that their populations actually decrease with immigration. It flies in the face of your logic.
             <br/>
             What I find more interesting is that your anti-vax bias creeps right through at a statement like that instead of critically analyzing it to see if there was some truth to it.

             See. Now thats an ad hominem fallacious argument. As I was mentioning above, you dont even see when you commit logical fallacies.
             <br/>
             What I find funny, is that because I dont believe in your fear mongering non-sense, and that I dont unequivocally trust your light-bringing, I must be a shill. Moreover, the natural approach to disease prevention is getting the disease itself which has proven way more fatal and harmful than a vaccines.
             <br/>

             I agree most of us learn the truth about allopathic medicine the hard way, my kids (30, 26,22) had their shots growing up, we accepted the post vaccine reaction (I now know was meningitis) as normal and treated accordingly, back then many of us naively trusted agencies, doctors etc. to be ethical and unbiased.
            </p>
            <p>
             I never gave it much thought until a couple of years ago when the grandchild in my care had a terrifying reaction denied by health care providers; like you Im disgusted by what Ive since discovered (for humans and pets), staying quiet is not an option.
            </p>
            <p>
             I ignore critics (clearly with zero life experience or children) who troll sites trying to bait, trigger or stir the pot with a snide remark or newly learned word of the week. Maybe theyre paid shills or just desperate for attention, but either way thoughtful, well referenced replies are a waste of time as they prefer personal attacks since their position lacks substance, facts or common sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even knowing itd open their eyes (like it has many of us) I still wouldnt wish a serious vaccine reaction on their loved ones, just themselvesmaybe just a crippling headache with non-stop vomiting, diarrhea, fever, malaise, feeling like crap from top to bottom for weeks before a painfully slow return to normal over several months (like my sweet grand daughter), if only all the vaccine injured could be so lucky

             To commit logical fallacies you have to be making an argument.
             <br/>
             Not sure what you mean by my light bringing. Nothing I say is fear mongering, Fear mongering is saying if you  vaccinate you and your kids you are endangering them and they will get sick.
             <br/>
             The natural approach to disease preventions is to build your immune system so it can protect itself and allow it to self heal when you get an ailment.

             Oh I can wrap around what the man was saying and it was clearly that if they use vaccines properly they can depopulate the world by 700m to 1.5b.

             I never said that just because people have more time to procreate they would like rabbits. I asked you how exactly would people living longer equate to less people being born and said if anything it would lead to higher birth rate.

             You count more than you realize than. The sharing of experience is more credible than studies bought to produce an outcome. Keep sharing your story it is making a meaningful difference.

             Unless of course, if its just your belief that vaccines caused it.

             WTF is wrong with people like you. She is one of the many parents that had a perfectly healthy child that gets vaccinated and dies shortly after and you are saying she maybe wrong and it may just be JUST her belief. News flash doctors rarely will even consider vaccines as a possibility because they are so safe. Read her comment this clearly happened with her!

             Yea I know that one of the goals of vaccination is to make people infertile. I was trying to get jim to expand on the logic he used to come up with no increase in abortions= no fertility issues. They are in know way related.

             Our son died well over a decade ago.  As I said we were stonewalled at every level, and in our shock and devastation

             received no support outside of family.   Without reliving the

             Thank you Josh.  Our son went from being a perfectly
             <br/>
             normal healthy baby to seizures and death within 36 hours of the DPT.   There are SO many countless cases of blatant
             <br/>
             vaccine injury or death like ours where the medical system
             <br/>
             closed ranks and despicably absolves itself of any responsibility.  Our numbers are invisible and the death certificate never states the real cause  vaccination.

             On a side note, Polysorbate 80 which has been studied in regards to infertility is a common vaccine ingredient (yes, I know its also used with ice cream etc., but injecting a substance has a more profound effect than digesting it)
             <br/>
             Vaccine monographs routinely note that impact on fertility

             has not be studied.   Amongst a slew of things vaccines

             arent studied nor monitored for, I find that troubling.

             Well its hard to provide that other than the fact a child is alive. I see plenty of children who were not vaccinated get sick badly because they werent vaccinated
            </p>
            <p>
             I worked in CPS and I can tell you Ive seen many many children adversely affected by vaccines. Ive seen many many children who are not vaccinated who dont have allergies, constant colds and ear infections, eczema, asthma, diabetes and a host of other chronic illnesses.  Pediatricians say chronically ill children today are the norm.   The autism rate in this country is 1:50.   The fact that a vaccinated child is alive is a testament to his/her immune system which we are all born with.  You pro-vaccine people seem to forget we are born with functioning immune systems that will continue to serve us providing we dont screw them up.  If these children are healthy their bodies are doing what it suppose to do and not because they have been vaccinated which by the way doesnt mean they are immunized.  How about giving you daughters immune system kudos for keeping her healthy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whats wrong with you people who give all their power over to a corporate America? Vaccines are not about health-its Politics and Profit.  Why do you think you can maintain the bodys health at the end of a needle from a syringe filled with toxins?  Tell me how can these ingredient improve the quality of a childs health:
            </p>
            <p>
              Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection
             <br/>
             from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease).
            </p>
            <p>
              Sodium chloride: Raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and
             <br/>
             salmonella bacteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple* vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Human albumin: The protein portion of blood from pooled
             <br/>
             human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. Injecting pooled blood can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency virus
             <br/>
             infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts.
            </p>
            <p>
             *Aborted Fetal Cells:  there seems to be a correlation between the use of aborted human fetal cells with the coincidental rise of autism. Several online articles corroborate that coincidence, e.g.,

              Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to
             <br/>
             embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation,
             <br/>
             respiratory distress and cancer. Plus, formaldehyde has been known to fail to deactivate the virus the vaccine is intended to cure, thus enabling a live virus to enter your blood and infect your system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phenoxyethanol: A glycol ether/chemical; highly toxic to the nervous system, kidneys, and liver. The FDA warns can cause shut down of the central nervous system (CNS), vomiting and contact dermatitis in cosmetics; imagine when injected into your blood.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aluminum phosphate: Greatly increases toxicity of mercury, so caution about minimum mercury tolerance
             <br/>
             is therefore severely underestimated. CDC scientists and all doctors are well aware of this.
            </p>
            <p>
              MSG (monosodium glutamate): When injected becomes
             <br/>
             a neurotoxin, causing CNS disorders and brain damage in children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now knowing some of what youre putting into your daughters body doesnt this give you reason for pause?  If not, heres what Dr. Russell Blaylock says about the vaccination process:
            </p>
            <p>
             If we look at the science of the vaccination process itself, its becoming evident that the way they do the immunizations, the vaccine of sticking it into the muscle of your arm and your leg actually suppresses a lot of your immune system, particularly in young children. We found out that in fact it causes the immune system to switch to what we call TH2 type cytokine production, which inhibits immunity. And your major protection against virus, particularly the really virulent, deadly viruses and bacteria is your cellular immunity. Well vaccines dont stimulate cellular immunity at all; in fact, they suppress it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also:
             <br/>
             We have known for decades that getting the childhood diseases naturally results in a permanent immunity to the specific microorganism. Getting the vaccines results in a temporary immunity, meaning that susceptibility is
             <br/>
             deferred and repeated booster shots will be required for the ENTIRE life of the individual. In the 80s, the specific
             <br/>
             immune mechanisms involved in vaccine-induced immunity was discerned. In the 90s, the same mechanisms in humans were explored. T cells (thymus cells) are the major cell in the immune system; they direct and control all immune responses as well as immune memory. Subsets of T cells are the T-helper cells (Th). T-helper cells coordinate and direct the safest and most effective immune response. Using Moskowitzs measles example, we know that, when infected with the measles
             <br/>
             virus naturally via the nasopharyngeal route, the body produces a Th1 response that externalizes the infection and provides permanent immunity. Fever, rash, coughing, sneezing, etc are signs of the body ridding itself of this infection. Bypassing the normal body lines of defense by injecting a vaccine forces the immune system into an
             <br/>
             emergency-based Th2 response which serves to internalize the infection. You dont get the disease but are susceptible to the disease later since the Th2 response results in poor immune memory. So, if a natural, viral (measles) infection results in a Th1 response, why dont we make vaccines that could elicit the same response.   (To put this simply, Th2 cell response is not a precursor to initiating immunity.  Th2 cell response induces an INFLAMMATORY response, locally and internally.
             <br/>
             TH1 cytokines initiates a immune response because it is stimulates via the normal immune route of the nose, throat, mouth, ears eyes etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1995, Golding and Scott, published the need for strategies to make vaccines that would generate the required Th cell to the corresponding microorganism. Since that time, attempts to produce vaccines that would generate a natural- type response have failed. So, we are left with vaccines that generate protective responses as a second choice. How does this work? In vaccine-induced Th2 responses, called humoral responses, the
             <br/>
             body produces large quantities of specific antibodies that block the virus from entering cells. This response is why a vaccinated child doesnt get a full blown infection and why the child wont spread as many viruses into the environment. However, antibodies cannot get into cells to eliminate viruses once the viruses are in the cells or cannot kill infected cells themselves. Therefore, the body
             <br/>
             has no choice other than to internalize the virus and be chronically infected when the body is forced into a Th2 antibody response. The body is essentially constipated with viruses that it cannot expel!

             If vaccines work than the CDC/Vaccine industry would do the study that the Government request they do 10 years ago-comparing the overall health of unvaccinated children to vaccinated.  If vaccines work the CDC and Vaccine Industry would provide the government, various independent research groups and individuals who have requested the raw data from the studies they supposedly have done.  Instead these groups are met with non-compliance even under the FOIA which is illegal.  You think Kathleen Seilubus would move forward with some sort of legal action-No.  She went to the media in 2009 and told them not to give anti-vaccine groups, especially experts any media time because its been proven vaccine work.  So these groups have requested the data that substantiates that vaccine work.  That was in 2009 and they are still waiting.  You dont hear about the adverse and deadly effects of vaccine in the media not because there is nothing  to say, its because the HHS secretary Sebelius threw up a Chinese wall.

             The Gates are eugenics just as his parents were.

            <p>
             Gates joins a long list of millionaire/billionaires who fund various medical charities who also believe in the practice of eugenics: The Rockerfellas, The Rothshides, The Windsors, The Kellogg Family, Henry Ford, Vanderbilts  etc.  There are many know who are not well know but the activities are covert. The more visible members of the group include Margaret Sanger, Winston Churchill, Marie Stopes, H. G. Wells, Norman Haire, Havelock Ellis, Theodore Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, John Harvey Kellogg, Linus Pauling and Sidney Webb to name a few.

             There is no hard evidence that vaccines increase longevity.
             <br/>
             Only long-term comprehensive monitoring of similar populations of vaccinated versus unvaccinated can indicate the respective states of health of each group.   Given the inferior health seen in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated in dogs (Purdue study) and primates (Hewitson et al) (and Id suggest in humans, too, in unofficial surveys comparing the two), I suspect  though dont claim to prove  that the unvaccinated would have a longer and healthier lifespan.
             <br/>
             It should also be noted that those who are living into their
             <br/>
             nineties, one hundred + today were never administered
             <br/>
             mass vaccinations as children as we see in todays
             <br/>
             jam packed, sooner than ever schedules.   I know many such people who had either one, two or no shots as children.   Its purely speculative how todays generation
             <br/>
             getting vaccines on steroids will fare years from now, but
             <br/>
             having seen children over many years, theres no way
             <br/>
             that this lot is healthier than those born even in the 70s.   You have to be really out of touch not to notice just how sickly todays kids are.

             Jim, What I promote is the opposite of fear. You mistake say that there are highly toxic substance in vaccines and that that is not medicine as fear mongering. Im simply informing people that this is harmful and there is and has always been a better and safer way to obtain optimal health. This from a place of love which is the opposite of fear.

             I know and people like jim refuse to admit that there is little scientific studies even done and the ones that are done are funded and ran by big pharma. So to me when they say science based medicine and are talking about the system in place they are using an oxymoron

             According to the CIA  Infant mortality rate  the US in 2007 was 47th on the chart-2013, its standing has dropped to 2147th.  Rwanda, Haiti, Laos, Sudan, Sengal Cambodia and other countries considered to be third world have a higher standing.  Obviously something is wrong.  Im willing to bet the US standing will not be any higher next year.

              we all understand what would happen if we put gasoline into the fuel tank of a car with a Diesel engine, or vise versa. Needless to say, damage would occur to the engine of both vehicles because we attempted to use a source of energy for which the engines were not designed. The damage would occur quickly and be immediately apps rent. Two damaging processes would take place. In both cases, the engines would be starved for the components they need to operate smoothly, while being damaged by components that are not designed for.  Most scientist and engineers would agree that the human being is the most intricate and amazing design known to the planet. Whether you believe that the creator is god or nature everyone agrees that the designer was not man. Man did not create man. Man did not create or design the earth or the universe. Man, regardless of desire or ego, does not posses the now ledge to fully comprehend the complexity of nature or the human blue print. With every new scientific discovery concerning the human body, we are yet further amazed by the majesty and intricacy of this grand design, obviously conceived by an intelligence far superior to our own.
             <br/>
             All the necessary components and nutrients for the sustenance of human life, as well as all living creatures on the planet, were also designed by this superior intelligence, not by man.
             <br/>
             A wise person concedes the fact, that for man to claim the ability to create a superior design opposed to the natural food sources and healing agents of the superior intelligence, for the long term benefit of man, is simply misguided false hood and foolish arrogance motivated in large by lust for profit.
             <br/>
             The current periodic table of elements , used universally in the field of chemistry list 110 known elements including; gases, solids, liquids, and synthetics. Twenty out of the 110 known elements listed are man-made or synthetic. Reflecting on mans ability to create a superior element is the fact that ALL TWENTY man-made synthetic elements are either a contamination hazard, radioactive, or both!

             If you dont see the difference open your eyes. Perhaps you are one of the misguided foolish arrogant men motivated by your lust for profit.

             If you actually read what I said, I said that I found the absence of study re. impacts of vaccines on fertility
             <br/>
             troubling. As I also noted in a comment sent to Josh
             <br/>
             a day ago (just below), no one knows the impacts vaccines could play re. infertility.
             <br/>
             Re. Polysorbate 80 in vaccines, the earliest monograph I can find it listed on is from 1997.  **If  Polysorbate 80 was not
             <br/>
             used or widely used in vaccines until the late 90s then
             <br/>
             common sense rules that any potential impacts will not
             <br/>
             become evident until girls who received vaccines with it enter their prime childbearing years.   Future study of infertility rates of the vaccinated vs unvaccinated may, indeed, reap more definitive answers.

             You are spreading the false info, not I and you are doing it in a way to scare people into using allopathic medicine. so we dont have dead and disabled children. is fear mongering and a lie.

             So if birth rate were to then rise it would be caused because the life expectancy would lower? Thats what your logic is saying.
             <br/>
             Btw you didnt answer how life expectancy  effects birth rate in the way you claim.

             UN estimates that in 20 years we will have to double our production of food. Yet there is no more land that can be used for additional farming, unless we cut down the remaining forests. So yes, our planet has its limits.

             Yes but jim, those studies are altered to say what  THEY want them to say. In other words they think nothing of lying to promote vaccines. There is too much money to lose.Something is very wrong with injecting more than 60 vaccines in children before the age of 6. Every child injured by vaccines is met with dismissal and indifference by doctors and hospital staff. What we do know is since the advent of vaccines the incidence of autism has become an epidemic.

             Thank you Roxanne though I can not take credit for composing it just merely using it to defend nature and crush trolls who dont see the difference between synthetic and natural.

             Its so annoying when they use the well its already in food cpmment as an argument for allowing it in vaccines. Just because it is currently allowed in foods in the us(a lot of toxic ingredients allowed in the us food supply are ban in the other industrialized counties.) food supply when it shouldnt be doesnt mean we should be adding it to more foods or medicine.

             A sterilizing agent would effect the birth rate becasue it makes people infertile becasue of this it would take a while to see it effect the overall population stats.
             <br/>
             You have argued that when bill gates said use vaccines to lower the population of the world by 15%, that he meant that vaccines do not kill but instead elongate life which his lowered the birth rate already.  So you admit that the birth rate is lowering, A sterilizing agent can effect birth rate however the population living longer would not. You have yet to give one logical reason why it would effect the it in this manor, all you have done was use the ad hoc fallacy of well in countries with rising life expectancies their is a lower birth rate so longer life expectancy is causing this. Correlation does not imply causation. I know you know this becasue you have tried to discredit a mother who blamed vaccines when her healthy boy died 3 days after getting vaccinated, Making you the worst kind of troll and a disturbing human

             What you are doing is using a red herring to steer the conversion away from a question she asked.
             <br/>
             She is not saying everything found in nature is safe, which is a naturalistic fallacy. She is clearly saying that toxins are harmful for the body and dont provide the nutrition that the the body needs. This is not a naturalistic fallacy its scientific fact, which is why you used the red herring in the first place.

             You mean the same Swedish people that dont vaccinate against measles, and when they get it as a child, their immune system handles it like it would chickenpox? People like jim leave this little tid bit out when they cite the measles outbreaks from Sweden.

             Yes, re. the doc. Dirt do try to view and share it.  Its done very well  both very entertaining and informative.   As I pointed out to JB above, its absurd to think healthy soil (the giver of life) carries the toxic stew that is injected via vaccines.

             Hi Josh, this was what I was referring to in regards to
             <br/>
             the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine.  The whole
             <br/>
             article is worth a read.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lets take whooping cough as an example. In 1979 Sweden withdrew use of the DTP vaccine on the basis that it was not effective and possibly unsafe. The fear, of course, would be that with lower vaccination rates, the death rate would increase. So what happened in this case? A 1995 letter from Victoria Romanus at the Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control indicated that deaths from whooping cough remained near zero. Swedens population was 8,294,000 in 1979 and 8,831,000 by 1995. From 1981 to 1993, eight children were recorded as dying, with the cause of death listed as pertussis. This averaged to be about 0.6 children per year possibly dying from whooping cough. These numbers show that the odds of dying from pertussis in Sweden were about 1 in 13,000,000 even when there was no national vaccination program. [6]  See more at:

             <br/>
             this awful vaccine linked to serious conditions and death.

             Agreed, its an absurd argument. Below are some quotes
             <br/>
             of which about three discuss the difference between
             <br/>
             injection versus digestion.
             <br/>
             When we eat protein it is broken down into its constituent amino acidsif a foreign animal protein makes it into our bloodstream without having being broken down this can set up an autoimmune type responseBy injecting things never meant to be in the body we are not only bypassing body defenses but wrongly activating other defenses.

             In the Rimavexmeasles vaccine we found various chicken viruses. In polio vaccine, we found acanthomeba which is so called brain-eating ameba. Simian  cytomegatovias in the polio vaccine, simian foamy in the rotavirus vaccine, bird cancer viruses in the MMR vaccine.various organisms in the anthrax vaccine, dangerous enzyme inhibitors in several vaccines. Duck, dog and rabbit viruses in the rubella vaccine. Avian leucosis virus in the flu vaccine, postivirus in the MMR vaccine Also, most dont know that some polio vaccines, adenovirus vaccines, rubella, Hepatitis A measles vaccines etc. have been made with aborted human fetal tissue.

             A single vaccine given to a six pound newborn is the equivalent of giving a 180 pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day. Include the toxic effects of high levels of aluminum and formaldehyde contained in some vaccines, and the synergist toxicity could be increased to unknown levelsBilary transport is the major biochemical route by which mercury is removed from the body, and infants cannot do this very well.  They also do not possess the renal (kidney)capacity to remove aluminum. Additionally, mercury is well-known inhibitor of kidney function.

             Its important to remember when you hear from vaccine safety promoters that ethylmercury (in thimerosal) disappears from the blood in several days, that the mercury leaves the plasma and enter the brain where it de-ethylated and remains for a lifetimeWhat they fail to mention is that only 7% of methylmercury is converted to ionic mercury whereas 34% of ethlymercury is converted in a short time.

             Mercury: Ingestion versus Injection
            </p>
            <p>
             In eating, a complex food containing tissue-bound mercury species, the persons digestive system containing metallothionen compounds reduce the amount of mercury that enters the body to some fraction of mercury in that food.  In contrast all the mercury in a vaccine enters the body Mercury in breast milk has been exposed to the protective proteins in the mothers human toxic protection system  the 360 micrograms/180 days or 2 micrograms/day of methyl mercury delivered over a twenty-four hour period.  A vaccine contains 12.5 to 25 micrograms of ethyl mercury- a six to twelve fold increase is injected instead of ingested within one minute.  In some vaccines, it is also combined with polymeric aluminum  hydroxyl materials which has been shown to raise the potential toxicity of thimerosal.

             It is clear from our analysis shown in Table 1 that US infants are exposed to mercury levels from their childhood immunization schedule that far exceed the EPA and FDA established maximum permissible levels for the daily oral ingestion of methyl mercury.  The fact that mercury in vaccines is given by injection rather than oral ingestion only makes the exposure levels worse because Grier et al. showed that the distribution of foreign particles in mice reached several logs higer concentration in organs following intraveneous or intramuscular injection than via oral ingestion.

             Thanks, I havent seen this report.  The same thing is being shown for measles in the unvaccinated parts of Sweden. They get measles, with very few dying from it, or getting one of the more severe complications. they then have life long immunity. I have had trolls use the measles outbreak in Sweden as proof we need vaccines for it but they always leave out these facts.

             I have watched or listened to hours of doctors blaylock and wakefield lectures or speaking arrangements. It doesnt take long to see how highly intelligent and ethical/moral these guys are.  I cant image anyone that has listened to them speak, still believing all the propaganda about these to heroes.

             Do you have a link re. the measles in Sweden? (No worries
             <br/>
             if it is a hassle to find)
             <br/>
             The trolls besides: 1) grossly exaggerating the nature and death rate of measles (most often successfully treated with Vitamin A in rare serious cases-whereas inappropriate
             <br/>
             fever reduction via pharmacheuticals causes complications) 2) denying the horrible toll of the MMR vaccine  also fail to grasp or simply deny the huge impact of mothers vaccinated against measles not being able to pass on antibodies to their babies.  Just one example of vaccines
             <br/>
             backfiring because they shift a normally benign
             <br/>
             childhood disease to infants or teens, adults when complications are more likely to arise.   As you said, getting the disease gives life long immunity and trains the immune system for more serious challenges in life.

             Exactly, brilliant doctors like Blaylock, Wakefield, Andrew
             <br/>
             Moulden  etc. are routinely denounced as part of well
             <br/>
             orchestrated smear tactics to attempt to discredit their critically insightful work. There are so many who pay the price for speaking out but thankfully, some have the backbone to stand for what is right in the face of the pharma cartel and its lackeys in health organizations etc.   Have you read or seen Dr. Rebecca Carley on Vaccines: Weapon of Mass Destruction?

             It did after I had her detox the heavy metals and got her off the processed junk and gmos. She was 25 at the time and was fainting a lot and at the end her face and her whole left side went numb like a stroke, she was walking around like a 80 year old.

             It was used by paul davis weeks ago to counter the outbreaks I was citing that contained very high percentage of vaccinated kids. He came up with case where the majority were unvaccinated. Inside the outbreak review, it said that it only effected the kids to young to have missed the last outbreak and that no kid that was in the older age group got measles. Im pretty sure it was from a religious part of Sweden but may be wrong. Im sure I can find the exact cite he used if not can find an article talking about it. Ill look for it in the am when im more awke

             No I havent read about her stuff. I was more up on the doctors that were actually telling the truth about the dangers and ineffectiveness of vaccines a few years ago. I kinda shifted more to holistic cures for aliments but have recently came back.

             I got her to add certain food that help the body detox like Cilantro, Garlic, turmeric, Beets ect ect. The man thing was she was eating so much processed food so I got her to go to sprouts and loaded her up with superfoods filled with the nutrients that her body was missing.
             <br/>
             I cant remember which one, but I ordered her some herbal supplements used in ayurvedic medicine, to help thin her body and help with circulation. The most important thing may have been the holy basil, to help with the stress that was clearly a major contributor.
             <br/>
             I cant seem to find the link to the Swedish measle outbreak. Im sure I will bump into it when im not looking lol

             People in third world countries try to have as many children as they can because they know most of their children will not survive. If you cant see the logic in such a simple concept then youre mentally subnormal.

             So is that why over 9000 cases have been denied in that court? With only just over 3000 settled? If you barely had to show any evidence, then most of those 9000 cases would have been paid. What training have doctors and pediatricians ever had in their pharma schooling, but to take to the denialist mindset, that vaccine damage simply does not ever happen? Such claims are not dependent on what your doctor thinks.Your comments contain just a disgusting level of dishonesty.

             I think I can shed some light on this. People are lazy, skimming through the comments they see a face they recognize every second post, far too many to read them all, but since they relate that face to an ignorant little git they just vote down all your posts.

             Mr shill, do me a favor and for once explain something in more detail than its a simple concept.  How exactly does le make the br drop?(you guys claim to be all about science, yet you dont seem to get that just because there is a correlation does not mean its the causation.) Please show how vaccines have been proven to raise le. You cant answer ever so you do what shills do and throw out red herrings.

             As guest

             explained above, the birth rate is high in many third world countries
             <br/>
             because parents know their children have a low chance of survival.
             <br/>
             Vaccines change all that. The children live long and healthy, so there
             <br/>
             is no longer the need to over breed.

             I need to learn respect? You have called me a imbecile how many times? A shill is saying you get paid to write what you write not an insult so it is you that need to learn respect.
             <br/>
             Guest did indeed say that, but it is not true and vaccines do not help the survival of babies either. Unvaccinated kids are far more healthy.

             I see a familiar pattern here; Person of subnormal intellect loses an argument, tries to cover it with a nonsensical rant, then declares their participation at an end. Its a cop-out technique for bowing out when you realise youre in over your head.

             Kelvin, I wonder if you have read the Karachi Soap Study? Can you show me evidence how vaccines do better than soap?

             Additionally, you will find plenty of information on infant mortality and piped water in third world countries.

             I dont think its as easy as you say  get vaccinated and you live a long healthy life. There are other important variables to consider.

             No Jeffry, I have not read that, but sanitation certainly can help to prevent disease. If you wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your nose or eyes (easier said than done!) then you can reduce your risks of catching viruses, such as colds and flu. However, no amount of personal hygiene can protect you from ingested or airborne pathogens.

             For those that dont have time to read it the conclusion is that regular handwashing with soap is very  effective  in  preventing  diarrhoea and  respiratory disease,  two  of  the  leading  causes  of  global  childhood death.  Handwashing  with  daily  bathing  also  prevents impetigo.

             The study was conducted in adjoining  squatter  settlements  in  Karachi,  Pakistan.

             I find the results unsurprising given the poor sanitation and open sewers in such settlements.

             You guys need to wake up.  Its alarming how many of you actually believe this kind of stuff.  If it werent for vaccines, many of you would be dead due to measles or smallpox or some other infectious disease.
            </p>
            <p>
             READ THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.  There is no causal relationship between vaccines and autism.  The rates are the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated children. As for this article specifically, this pentavalent vaccine has been proven safe and well tolerated.  It also reduces and simplifies the immunization schedule.

             Arent you fear mongering in the same way JimBob when you are worried about getting an illness, even though that would be the best way for your immune system to fight that illness later? You dont trust your body enough to protect itself from getting too sick, so instead lets rely the almighty human race to do it, right? You know, that race that is so big on murder and rape and war and keeping the elite alive? Sorry, there just isnt enough evidence our there for me to believe that there are absolutely no long term negative affects brought on by vaccines. If I had to choose what to be more afraid of, my baby getting sick or my baby getting injected with about 15 vaccines at the same time, Id pick my baby getting sick. Unless I know for sure what will exactly happen to my baby as a side effect of the vaccines he/she is given, I will not be putting HepB, flu or polio vaccines in my kids.

             Look up Sherri Tenpenny on YouTube. Com.  She is a medical doctor and research specialist regarding vaccines.  ALL her information comes from CDC and other main stream pro vaccine entities regarding studies and scientific documentation.  She thousands of links to partial and complete papers listed on fairly new site for anyone to search them self.   Parents are never given this information by their physician, many of who are ignorant of this information themself.  Many physicians are like computers, they can only output the information that has been strategically put in and refuse to acknowledge comments and obvious cause and effect regarding the thousands upon thousands of reactions in perfectly healthy children directly following injection.  Insane.
