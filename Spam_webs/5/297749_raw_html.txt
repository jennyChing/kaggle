        2 Years Later: My Experience as a Drupal Initiative Lead
       </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
       I didnt see Larrys presentation, but I did read his recent post,
       <a href="http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/on-drupals-leadership">
        On Drupal Leadership
       </a>
       . Since I was mentioned in this post and comments, Ive decided to respond with more detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I completely agree with Larrys description of the Initiative Leader role being a glorified secretary role. I say that as a female who spent years in the corporate world as an actual secretary, and Im not knocking the secretary role. Anyone who has been a secretary knows its an important role, so its hardly offensive. However, when you sign on for a job that contains the word leader, you dont expect to spend the majority of your time doing tasks that literally fit the job description of a secretary. And when you are a leader with no actual authority, well thats where the glorified part applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many reasons why I left. I got into some of them at a very high level in
       <a href="http://jacine.net/post/24652270662/core">
        this post
       </a>
       , specifically trying to curb the negativity, and do so quietly, so as to not discourage some of the great work that was being done by a small handful of front-end contributors. I had no idea that I was being elbowed out, and while there was and always has been heated criticism around issues and ideas, it was never that, that drove me out. As shitty as it is sometimes, that comes with the territory. The final straw was when it got personal, and my own thoughts and beliefs were policed and I was publicly shamed for negative comments because as an initiative lead, I should not been saying such things. Fuck that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two years later, a few of things that Ive learned have really stuck with me:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <span>
         Unless you work for Acquia, or an employer that sponsors your time 100%, you contribute at great professional risk and personal cost. Personally, I started to feel like an unpaid Acquia intern, which sucked, despite how much the work was appreciated or not.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         When you stop contributing a large portion of your life to this software you are forgotten about pretty quickly. In the end, whats most important is client work, and letting that suffer while putting contributions first was a mistake.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         You know that saying: Come for the software, stay for the community. Well, the reverse applies just as much, and in my experience, I learned that very few of these people were actually my friends despite contributing and collaborating on core for 3 years on a daily basis.
        </span>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So, depending on your situation, your mileage will definitely vary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I left, I worked on a few client projects, including spending a year with Tag1 Consulting (the best team of Drupal professionals Ive worked with). Then I took a year off while spending 40 weeks pregnant and now have a beautiful 5 month old baby girl. And Drupal 8 just got into beta. LOL. So, yeah I dont regret leaving at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of re-hashing what I felt back then in retrospect, Ive decided to share a personal email that I wrote 2 years ago while it was all still fresh because I stand by every word today. Its a reply to a member of the community that asked me what I found frustrating and what ultimately made me leave the Initiative Lead role:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <span>
         I originally thought the role was going to come with authority and even commit access. Instead, the role was literally cat-herding, with a slightly louder voice than everyone else and no authority to actually get shit done.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         The leadership community (mostly Acquia employees) is trying to manage initiatives using Agile methods, including Project managers and sprints, etc. For me, this resulted in constantly feeling pressured to produce results, while not being able to actually control any of the work that was or wasnt taking place because obviously Drupal contributors are mostly transient volunteers, and definitely not full-time employees.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         There is a lack of understanding and interest in front end development in general and as it pertains to Drupal among the core developer community. Its something most of them happily ignore as unimportant enough that they dont need to wrap their brains around it. Simple things need to be explained repeatedly.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         There is abuse of issue queue rules going on daily, which results in many issues not being accurately prioritized and categorized. HTML5 Initiative issues were mostly categorized as feature requests and even documentation update, when they clearly were not. The issues were frequently left to sit in the RTBC queue waiting for real major issues to be resolved.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         Theres a lack of resources and contributors available to help with front-end goals and promises to get additional help in the issue queue never came through.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         Simple issues take months and months of back and forth catty nonsense and dick measuring in the issue queue to resolve, which is extremely frustrating and demotivating for everyone involved.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         The job of Initiative owner requires at least 25-30 hours a week to do well, which is damn near impossible to do without being sponsored by an employer. I did it for over 9 months after going freelance, and saw my income decline, and the steady work that I had previously disappear. Ive still not recovered from this.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         You have to pour countless hours into research, keeping up with the issue queue, trying to flesh out and propose ideas, motivating others to contribute even when youre not motivated yourself.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         You have to be willing to travel. People will pressure and expect you to shell out the thousands of dollars of cash to pay for these trips. The fact that I dont like public speaking, combined with the loss of income, made this a nightmare for me. I was constantly disappointing people by saying no to attend or speak at events.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         There are geek cliques and out of control egos galore. Some of it comes with the territory, but theres a lot of high school bullshit that I want no part of.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         When you have a high visibility role in a project like Drupal you are expected to maintain a certain level of professionalism, no matter what. Speaking negatively about Drupal is discouraged (not forbidden, but strongly discouraged) unless its also accompanied by a plan to fix the problems.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         More and more core developers dont work as developers on actual Drupal sites anymore, so they drift further and further from the day to day implications of the code they write. I find this troubling and dont want to head down that path.
        </span>
       </li>
       <li>
        <span>
         A few front end developers in the Drupal community spend more time advertising their own contrib projects than anything else. Its embarrassing and has started this whole trend of people that pit one project against another. People blindly rely on these themes instead of actually being creative and innovative. It seems like a big departure from where the community was a few years ago.
        </span>

        Stepping Down from Core Development

        Ive never been a fan of being in the spotlight. Unfortunately, my contributions to Drupal eventually came with more responsibility and visibility in the community, which led to a great deal of being in the spotlight on one level or another. When asked to lead the HTML5 Initiative, my initial gut reaction was to say no, and I did. I pondered for weeks before finally agreeing to do it. Ultimately, I said yes because people in the community that I have a lot of respect for wanted me to do it, and I didnt want to let them down. I felt that I could effect positive change and attract more front-end developers to participate in the process. I had just spent the last 1.5 years making enough changes to Drupal 7 to be among the top 50 contributors to Drupal core, and while it was a struggle on more occasions than others, I felt good about the work and I had no reason to believe that Drupal 8 would be different.

        It was okay for a while, but during the last year, Ive have some pretty crappy experiences with some people in the community and working with Drupal itself. Im not going to get into much detail and I wont name names in private either, so please dont ask. I will say this I started noticing things changing for the worse almost a year ago. Discussions often get heated because there are lots of passionate people involved with strong opinions. Ive always seen this as a downside of participating and have had a low tolerance level for it from day one. And maybe its just that my perception of things has changed, but it seems to have gotten considerably worse over a short period of time. Ive also experienced some relationships that were important to me deteriorate, which has been nothing short of depressing. Ive been vocal about some of it, but for the most part its been a long, lonely road that has left me completely uninterested in contributing any more of my time to Drupal core.

        Overall, my experiences with Drupal, both personally and professionally, have been on the decline for the last year. Ive consistently become more frustrated, and had less and less to say, on Twitter and elsewhere, for fear of offending one person or another, or having my words be misinterpreted. Ive been called out for speaking negatively on more than one occasion, and told that as a leader in the community I should not say such things. Im now at a point where I rarely even monitor Twitter, the issue queue, or GDO. I cannot even tell you how many comments and tweets that Ive composed only to never actually post them. Its more than trying to not say anything if I dont have anything nice to say, and I dont like feeling this way.

       <span class="c2">
        Ultimately what it comes down to for me, and of course your mileage will vary, is that its no longer working for me. Contributing used to be fun, and I used to feel like my contributions effected positive change, but thats no longer the case, and I cant seem to get out of the rut to turn things around, so Ive decided not to contribute to Drupal in any sort of official role anymore.

        The reason this post exists is because I feel that I owe an explanation and apology for my absence to the members of community that contributed to and were counting on me to lead the HTML5 Initiative to the completion of Drupal 8. Im sorry that Ive let you down, but I can no longer do it. Not only has it been a trying and stressful experience on a personal level, its also been a drain on my finances that I need to rectify and that takes priority over everything else right now.

       Its a mess. Yeah, I said it.  Its time to admit there is a problem and get serious about fixing it. In this post, Im going to explain what I think the problems are, and how Id like to see them fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the last year, Ive spent a lot of time working on the HTML5 Initiative. There has been an incredible amount of work done, by a truly awesome, and growing team. Weve gotten a
       <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1193054">
        whole
       </a>
       <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1183606">
        lot
       </a>
       done so far. The HTML5 Shiv has been added to core, the major templates are all done, and work on Form API elements is moving along. Were also doing CSS re-factors, at minimum separating administrative styles from the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, Ive found myself very unhappy with the theme layer. I see a lot of work going into
       <a href="http://garfieldtech.com/blog/web-services-initiative">
        WSCCI
       </a>
       and now the
       <a href="http://buytaert.net/layouts-for-drupal-8">
        Layout Initiative
       </a>
       that is really exciting. What I dont see is if and how that will actually affect the theme system we work with today. This has been really discouraging for me, mostly because Id like to see a lot more than just markup changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive also become skeptical as to whether or not improvements for PHP developers automatically translate into front end improvements. I feel that we got burned with the implementation of Render API.  I dont think this was intentional or anything, just sort of
       <a href="http://garfieldtech.com/blog/drupal-priorities">
        the way things are
       </a>
       . I believe the problems that it attempts to solve are hard and the way it goes about it is good, but it was implemented so inconsistently that it ended up making things harder. Many are unwilling to even give it a chance. Without consistent patterns to rely on, many of us are lost. Had the entirety of Drupals code base been converted to use the Render API, maybe it would have been different.
      </p>
      <h2>
       We are Doing it Wrong
      </h2>
      <p>
       When I complain about the theme system, Im often surprised by some of the reactions I get.  Many developers know there is a problem, but some seem completely unaware of the problems we face, and the things (which they would consider hacks) we have to do to get the job done. So, in no particular order here is what I think is wrong:
      </p>
      <h3>
       Too Many Templates and Theme Functions
      </h3>
      <p>
       Creating a new template was the answer for everything in both Drupal 6 and 7. It has been done carelessly, over and over again, and encouraged as The Drupal Way.  As a result, we have hundreds of them. This is just plain ridiculous, considering there are only 109 HTML tags, most of them are used in groups and many of them are text-level elements that wouldnt exist in Drupals theme system. Wed never have theme functions or templates for
       <code>
        &lt;b&gt;
       </code>
       ,
       <code>
        &lt;em&gt;
       </code>
       ,
       <code>
        &lt;i&gt;
       </code>
       ,
       <code>
        &lt;p&gt;
       </code>
       ,
       <code>
        &lt;strong&gt;
       </code>
       ,
       <code>
        &lt;span&gt;
       </code>
       , etc. At least I hope not.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Lack of Consistency
      </h3>
      <p>
       There is hardly any consistency in what were doing inside templates and theme functions. Templates are a mess of arrays, strings, render arrays, and random theme settings variables.  Look no further than page.tpl.php, which is the first impression newbies get with Drupal. In order to change a given variable in page.tpl.php, you need to first track down how it was generated and then figure out the appropriate function that will allow you to change it, which could be one of SO MANY different things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        THEME_preprocess_page()
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_process_page() if that doesnt work or youre looking for something that happens late.
       </li>
       <li>
        Theme settings tweaks in the .info file, and the UI, along with one of the above.
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_menu_local_tasks_alter() if you want to modify contents of tabs or action links.
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_menu_local_tasks() if you want to modify the markup of the tabs.
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_menu_local_task() if you want to modify the markup for the list item and links for the tabs.
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_menu_local_action() if you want to modify the markup for the list items and links for the action links. Oh, and dont forget to wrap that one in a
        <code>
         <code>
          &lt;ul&gt;
         </code>
        </code>
        because just printing the rendering the variable alone leaves you with list items but without a
        <code>
         <code>
          &lt;ul&gt;
         </code>
        </code>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_links(), THEME_links__main_menu() or THEME_links__secondary_menu() to change the markup for the navigation links.
       </li>
       <li>
        THEME_page_alter() if you need to hide or relocate regions or get at anything inside them.
       </li>
      </ul>
      This is insane. And we wonder why people have a hard time learning Drupal. And for the record, the
      <a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel_themer">
       Theme Developer
      </a>
      module will not help all of this, nor is it the answer, and neither is documentation.
      <h3>
       Data Structure
      </h3>
      <p>
       Data structure is a nightmare, and clearly an afterthought. The variables in templates are complicated, unreliable, and chronically inconsistent and it all starts with the data structure. Unless you are a PHP Ninja and can deal with pre-render functions, good luck trying to change a table into a list or vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drupal may be notorious for its large, complex arrays, but IMO they are not the problem, nor is the existence of data structure.  I believe the fact that data structure is whipped up on a case by case basis and pushed straight to templates in many cases is the root cause for the mess of a theme system that we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how much easier Drupal would be to learn if the data structure was completely consistent? Imagine if you could just guess based on experience where the value you are looking for is? Imagine if you could transform the format provided for the output from plain text to a definition list by setting one property before rendering?  Imagine if contrib developers didnt have to write theme functions for everything?
      </p>
      <h3>
       Too Many Levels of Processing
       <h3>
       </h3>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Weve got preprocess, process, pre-render and and there can be endless implementations of these. There are no hard and fast rules for when to use one over the other.  Sometimes you learn the hard way that you need to use process instead of preprocess because some module decided to add a variable in the process phase, and nothing you are doing to override that variable has worked in preprocess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other times youll get burned by pre render functions.  For example, a while back I was struggling trying to prevent the filter help text from printing on a comment form.  Attempting to hide it in a preprocess, process function or a form alter implementation simply did not work because there is a pre-render and process function manipulating it. The only place it would work was in the template itself. Ultimately I had to implement hook_theme() to use a template for the form solely to accomplish a simple hide(), because the template was the only place it would actually work. It took me hours to figure this out because the data I had access to in the theme layer was what it looked like before before the pre-render function changed it. Thats way too much troubleshooting and steps to accomplish something that small. This sort of thing is just maddening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, there is no shared processing phase across theme hooks. The default preprocess variables ONLY apply to template file implementations, and cannot be used for theme functions. This means if you need any of the default variables, such as attributes or
       <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21theme.inc/function/_template_preprocess_default_variables/7">
        anything else created here
       </a>
       , you must recreate it in your own theme function implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesnt seem worth it at the end of the day to me.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Your Output is NOT Special
      </h2>
      <p>
       Sorry, but its just not.  We need to stop treating output as a product of the immediate need of whatever module or API is generating it. The content should drive the output, not the system or API behind it. Im not saying that we should remove identifiers from output, i.e. a class that labels a container a node or a block.  What Im saying is
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Instead of creating new theme hooks for everything under the sun, we should have a common library of components and formats to pull from and utilize.
       </li>
       <li>
        Every container, for example, should be handled the same exact way, whether its for a region, node, form element, or whatever.
       </li>
       <li>
        We should stop abusing theme settings to manage content and leave that up to things like blocks, so that content can actually be managed by Drupal. It is a CMS after all.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We dont have this today.  What we do have is often abused and or not flexible enough, so modules create one-off implementations because its easier for them to get the job done.  This ends up hurting everyone.  Its more code, more complexity, and the attempts to improve things little by little without any planning are making it worse.
      </p>
      <h2>
       What I Want to See
      </h2>
      <p>
       Ive been thinking about this for a long, long time, and Ive started to try and get a handle on what we could possibly do numerous times in the past, starting as far back as two years ago. Ultimately, Id always be asked How can we fix it and always just gave up because the changes that would be required are just massive, and I dont know if I have the technical aptitude to pull it off. Recently I realized that its never going to happen unless Im able to communicate what Id like to see somehow, so six weeks ago, I bit the bullet and started gathering my thoughts. I came up with the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: Its still very rough, and not completely thought out. It also doesnt aim to solve all of these problems, but I think its an improvement. Also, I am a theme developer, not a module developer, so please dont destroy me if you see something you dont think will work. All of this is up on GitHub and you are welcome to tweak it, log potential problems and send pull requests. Ok?  Great.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Provide Two Structural Templates
      </h3>
      <dl>
       <dt>
        Container
       </dt>
       <dd>
        The main purpose of a container is simply to wrap Items (see below). They can be used for anything from regions to nodes to form elements. They usually contain a heading, whether visible or not, and can print ALL children (items) in the base template for that container (sort of like the way you can print and entire view inside views-view.tpl.php).
       </dd>
       <dt>
        Items
       </dt>
       <dd>
        Items are structured content, which are eventually styled via formats (see below) and or components.  They do not print ANY wrapper markup by default, and can optionally be wrapped with containers.
       </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
       Both of these templates contain the same variables, and the same data structure for as much as humanly possible. They also include $append and $prepend variables that allow content to be injected at the beginning and the end of templates. These are special variables to deal with things like Contextual Links and Shortcut links, which also contain structured content and should not be abused like #prefix and #suffix are today.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Use Formats and Components to Generate Output
      </h3>
      <dl>
       <dt>
        Formats
       </dt>
       <dd>
        Formats consist of HTML markup as defined by the spec. Some examples of formats include, unordered or ordered lists, definition lists, tables, etc. Formats need to be extremely flexible. They are variants of the default item implementation, and the key to making them awesome is providing the same data structure across different formats so that they can easily be swapped to use one or another without having to manipulate data.
       </dd>
       <dt>
        Components
       </dt>
       <dd>
        Components are usually a combination of containers and formats that make up custom UI elements. Examples of components include Tabs, Vertical Tabs, Form Widgets (like password confirm and machine name), Carousels, Accordions, etc. Components usually have recommended use cases for application. Their implementation can vary from CSS and JavaScript standpoint, but their markup is pretty standard.
       </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>
       Some of the Potential Benefits
      </h2>
      <p>
       If we are able to pull this off the way Im envisioning, we can drastically reduce the number of templates. We can continue to give the theme developer control over the markup without so many assumptions and a sane, reliable data structure and workflow, which IMO will make Drupal a lot easier to learn and a lot less frustrating to use.  It should also allow us to use other theme engines, instead of being locked into PHP Template.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, check it out. Its not, by any means complete, but there are some examples that should give you a decent idea of what it would look like:
