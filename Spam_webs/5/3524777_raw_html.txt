    On The Two Intertwined Dragons from Pendzikent
   </h3>

  <p>
   Among the lesser finds at
Pendzikent stands out - owing to its iconographic peculiarity -
a clay sculpture found in the ruins of the
   <i>
    iwan
   </i>
   Sector II, the
temple area. ( Pl. I) The object itself, brought to light by
excavations in 1952, has been published repeatedly (Beleniskij &amp;
Piotrovskij 1959: table. XXV; Belenitsky 1968: fig.105; Belenitzki
1982: fig. 92), although the only text that describes it and
conjectures as to its function goes back fifty years (Beleniskij &amp;
Piotrovskij 1959: 66-67).
  </p>
  <p>
   The singularity of this image and the
possibility of reading it in a not exclusively decorative'
key have led me to propose a new in-depth analysis, a modest
contribution which I dedicate to Boris Marshak, a great scholar and
close friend.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <i>
    Object: Clay sculpture
    <br/>
    Subject: Two intertwined dragons

    <br/>
    State of Preservation:  Broken at bottom right and
along the base
   </i>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The back part comprises a
semi-cylindrical block of clay, broken at the bottom. The front -
modelled to form a more-or-less horseshoe-shaped niche - is
entirely bordered by a high-relief moulding framed by two smooth
fillets, the space between decorated
by a set of heart-shaped leaves, which were moulded
separately. Only a few of the latter have been preserved, but their
place is clearly indicated by the hollows. The niche rests on a base
with a smooth upper and lower fillet, the part between divided into
boxes by double vertical lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Within the niche are portrayed two rampant
fighting dragons, moulded in high relief, their bodies in profile
heraldically confronting each other, with their central section
knotted together. The figures represent a combination of several
animals: the posterior is snakelike, while the front part is an
association of various elements: a dog's or wolf's muzzle
with jaws half-open, a short beard below the chin, ears and horns, a
dorsal crest and short wings, and - lastly - the front
legs of a feline. Owing to their position, the two dragons fit the
shape of the niche perfectly. The upper and wider part houses their
heads and the front portion of their bodies. The centre, where the
space narrows, is entirely filled by the intertwining of the first
portion of the snakelike part, while the base - where the niche
widens and ends with two scrolls - is taken up by the
symmetrical and specular portrayal of the terminal portion (a
fish-shaped or foliate tail is shown on the left).
  </p>
  <p>
   Beleniskij, after a brief description of the
composition, underlines the fact that the decoration of the base
moulding closely recalls another fragmentary clay sculpture coming
from the same area, which can be positively identified as a
headdress, and cautiously proposes that this should also be
identified as part of a tiara (Beleniskij 1959: 67 and table XXXVIII,
3).  This hypothesis has been put forward in the captions of all
subsequent publications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clearly, his reading is still possible, though
anything but certain. What is interesting, however, is not so much
the object's function (which would even be rather difficult to
define), as the theme of the two entwined dragons, a theme unique -
as far as I know - among the items found at Pendzikent up to
now.
  </p>
  <p>
   A further two fragments of
clay sculpture portraying dragons have also been found in the ruins
of the
   <i>
    iwan
   </i>
   . Of the first (Beleniskij-Piotrovskij 1959: table
XXXVI,1) only the animal's muzzle remains, portrayed in
profile, with its jaws open. Of the second, the muzzle survives -
also in profile with open jaws - and the front part of the
body, showing the short wing and feline paw (Beleniskij-Piotrovskij
1959: table XXXVI, 2). The three images - the fragments just
mentioned and the sculpture that is the subject of this study -
undoubtedly have features in common (see in particular the shape of
the muzzle, the wing and the paw in Beleniskij-Piotrovskij 1959:
table XXXVI, 2), but nothing can be said about the rear parts of the
two fragments. Above all, in the fragments, the two dragons are
portrayed alone and - in all probability - in passant
posture. Substantially similar, including the posture, is another
portrayal of a dragon coming from the palace of Varahsa (Siksin 1963:
183 and fig.105). Of the stucco sculpture, only the head and neck -
shown in profile - remain: the muzzle is portrayed in detail,
with open jaws and pointed teeth; the sculpture of the dorsal crest
is very precise, with open-ring protrusions; the neck is tubular,
almost snakelike. Although the subject is similar, or partly similar,
the "knotted dragon" composition remains unique.
  </p>
  <p>
   We must, however, examine more
closely the context in which the sculpture was found. As mentioned
above, it was found in the ruins of the
   <i>
    iwan
   </i>
   , Sector II,
featuring the well-known and imposing clay frieze portraying aquatic
figures (Beleniskij-Piotrovskij 1959: tables XXVII-XXXIII ). Whatever
precise cult value may be attributed to the frieze
   <a href="#note1sym" name="note1anc">
    <sup>
     1
    </sup>
   </a>
   ,
the depiction of the dragons ties in well enough - at least
iconographically - with the monstrous and composite figures
that crowd the aquatic landscape. It is worth recalling that among
the subjects of the frieze are images of purely classical origin,
which assuredly reflect the Gandharan experience: one representative
figure is a triton, wholly comparable to a set of Gandharan
bas-reliefs (Dani 1968-69: figs.19-20). Our dragons, too, may easily
be compared with the composite figures that decorate the lateral
portions of the top of false gable and the string panels of a stair 
of Gandharan sculptures. The latter are, however, always isolated
dragons, with a body associating the parts of various animals and a
posture wholly conforming to the architectural space available: thus,
the front portion of the body with its canine muzzle, dorsal crest,
short wings and feline paws fits the wider area perfectly, while the
rear of the snakelike body fits happily with the narrowing of the
terminal part (Dani 1868-69: figs 26-30; Kurita 1990: figs 718-721). 
In almost all cases, comparison with Gandhara ends with a typological
similarity, seeing that - as we have already said - the
images are either single or, in the case of friezes,  passant images
in Indian file (Zwalf 1996: 254 and fig. 345).
  </p>
  <p>
   There are, however, at least two exceptions.
  </p>
  <p>
   A frieze now in the
British Museum portrays a series of earth dragons (canine muzzle,
wings, dorsal crest, feline body) facing each other two by two and
standing on their back legs, while their bodies, rendered with a
tubular shape, produce an undulating line that generates a
superimposed double
   <b>
    S
   </b>
   (Zwalf 1996: 253-254 and fig. 344).
  </p>
  <p>
   The second specimen ( Pl. II) is of great
significance and deserves careful attention. It is a rectangular
panel, of unknown provenance, and belongs to a Japanese private
collection (Kurita 1990: fig.716), delimited above by a moulding with
vegetal elements and on the sides by two half-columns with
Indo-Corinthian capitals. Within this, two high-relief dragons stand
out in profile, rampant on their back legs, seizing each other with
their front legs in a clearly combative attitude. Typologically they
are earth dragons, already known from other Gandharan reliefs: a
canine head with a pronounced twisted almost trumpet-like muzzle,
feline ears, body and paws, foliate wings. Up to where they join the
back legs, a tubular, almost snakelike shape renders the neck and
body. At the waist, the two dragons are linked by what would
technically be defined as a reef- or flat knot, generated by the
hindquarters conceived as a single component and the forequarters and
heads, also conceived as a single component. It may be more easily
explained by saying that the knot is generated, not by the clasping
and entwining of the two whole figures, but by the joining of one
part that is all tail with the other part that is all head.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the different typologies of the dragons
in the Gandharan relief (earth dragons) and the Pendzikent ones
(water dragons), their compositional resemblance stands out: in both
cases, the dragons are portrayed in profile, rampant and combatant
and - above all - are knotted together at the centre of
their bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although such a singular composition can be read in a
purely decorative key, semantic values cannot be excluded.
  </p>
  <p>
   A decisive factor in view of this second hypothesis is
that in Islamic iconography, the "knot or node" has a
precise meaning. Hartner, in a study going back 60 years, but still
fundamental and unsurpassed, deals with the matter in great detail
(Hartner 1938) and should be consulted for a complete analysis of the
problem. Here, I shall merely recall that the knot and/or knotted
animals (whether dragons or snakes) are a "sign that stands
for" the phenomena of lunar and solar eclipses. In ancient
mythological tradition, widespread among different and distant
peoples and cultures (Sorrentino 1990), the terrifying phenomenon of
the disappearance of the sun and moon is attributed to a monstrous
being that swallows the two supreme luminaries. 'As to the
nature of this great antagonist of light and life, there rules an
astounding agreement among the peoples, as most of them suppose it to
be a giant snake or dragon, menacing the great luminaries, and
devouring them at certain irregular intervals' (Hartner 1938:
131). In India and Iran, the demon that devours the sun and moon is
called respectively Rahu and
   <u>
    Dj
   </u>
   awzahr.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is common consent among scholars that the Iranian
tradition in the astronomic and astrological field has been strongly
influenced by the Indian ( Renou et Filliozat 1985: 193-194; Pingree
1987: 859 ). We may briefly recall what it says about the phenomenon
of eclipses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leaving aside the story of the Vedic
   <i>
    asura
   </i>
   Svarbhanu, identified by many scholars with Rahu - with the
exception of Jamison (1991: 142) , who identifies it with Agni -, the
first mentions of Rahu as planet and monster that devours the moon
are found in the
   <i>
    Atharvaveda
   </i>
   (Pant 1981: 279). Ketu appears in
the same context, but only as a planet and a comet, meteor or falling
star. Throughout the pre-Siddhantic period, only Rahu was held
"responsible" for eclipses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The demon is well known not only to the Brahmanic
tradition, but also to the Buddhist. On several occasions, the
   <i>
    Jataka
   </i>
   s refer to the moon gripped between Rahu's jaws,
or being freed from Rahu's jaws. This theme is a standard
   <i>
    topos
   </i>
   , repeatedly utilised as a comparison in different
contexts. Thus, in the
   <i>
    Titthajataka
   </i>
   , of the monk who conquers
Arhatship, it says, ' He, like the moon that wins her way at
last from Rahu's jaws, has won supreme release' (Cowell 1981: I,
65). Yet again, in the
   <i>
    Kunalajataka
   </i>
   , we read, 'A man
..yet fall'n 'neath woman sway, no more will shine than moon
eclipsed by Rahu's power malign' (Cowell 1981: V, 244). Neither
should we forget that in the
   <i>
    Buddhacarita
   </i>
   Siddhartha's
son is called Rahula  'with the  face  of Rahu's
adversary' ( Johnston 1972: II 48, 29). Lastly - and not
because it is less important -, I quote the story recounted in the
   <i>
    Candrasutra
   </i>
   in which the Buddha converts Rahu, thus liberating
the moon (E.Waldschmidt 1970).
  </p>
  <p>
   It is in the
   <i>
    Purana
   </i>
   s that we first find the
whole story of Rahu and the reasons for his enmity with Sun and Moon.
 The story forms part of the cosmogonal myth of the churning of the
Ocean. 'It was he (i.e. Rahu) who, previous to the churning of
the milk ocean, commanded the demons, then allied with the celestial
gods in the struggle against the world serpent, Ananta. After the
victorious event, he succeeded in an unguarded moment in sipping the
amrita drink; but the sun and the moon, who had watched his crime,
denounced him to the gods, and instantly Vishnu, approaching in
haste, severed his head from his body. Nevertheless, the amrita had
already produced its effects and rendered him immortal like the
celestials. Consequently, Rahu's head as well as his body, Ketu,
intransigent enemies of the two great luminaries, ever since try to
devour the sun and the moon whenever occasion serves, and thus cause
solar and lunar eclipses (Hartner 1938: 131).
  </p>
  <p>
   As far as Iran is concerned, the most ancient written
evidence is found in the
   <i>
    Bundahisn
   </i>
   , a text compiled in the
ninth century CE, but in which 'traditional, orthodox beliefs
derived from the Zoroastrian scriptures appear side by side with
later and even contemporary scientific opinions' (MacKenzie
1964:  511). Here, the two entities that oppose the sun and moon
appear 'as Dark (i.e. presumably 'eclipsed') Sun and
Dark Moon. These hostile entities which intercept the light of the
luminaries are the head and tail of the Dragon
Gocihr At the beginning of celestial motion
the head (the ascending node of the moon's orbit upon the ecliptic,
   <i>
    Sanskrit
   </i>
   Rahu) was in Gemini, the tail (
   <i>
    Sanskrit
   </i>
   Ketu)
in Sagittarius.' ( Brunner 1987: 867).
  </p>
  <p>
   The mythological reading of the phenomenon survives
even when the scientific causes are clear. To quote Hartner again,
'We might suppose that clear insight into the physical causes of
eclipses would have thrown the mythological tradition into the
background. But this has not been the case. What we observe is that
the mythological and astronomical elements contract an intimate
fusion. The nodes of the moon's orbit are simply identified with the
eclipse monster itself: with the Hindus, Rahu becomes the ascending,
Ketu the descending node; with Persians and Arabs, the head and the
tail of the
   <u>
    Dj
   </u>
   awzahr play the same role.' (Hartner
1938:131).
  </p>
  <p>
   If we pass from the written tradition to iconography we
find it is the Indian world that offers the most ancient portrayals
of Rahu and Ketu (Sivaramurti 1958). The two demons appear starting
from the sixth century CE in the
   <i>
    navagraha
   </i>
   group, together
with the five planets, the sun and moon, and - like the other
seven - are shown in anthropomorphic form. More precisely, Rahu
is shown in anthropomorphic form whereas, in some images, Ketu is
shown with a human torso and a snakelike lower body, often
knotted.
   <a href="#note2sym" name="note2anc">
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
   </a>
   The anthropomorphic iconography also persisted in south-eastern Asia,
where, however, the lower part of Rahu's body is enveloped and
hidden by clouds (Bhattacharya 1956; Idem 1964),
and in the Buddhist Silk Road art at the Khara Khoto site (Kocetova
1947: 492-495).
   <a href="#note3sym" name="note3anc">
    <sup>
     3
    </sup>
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Iranian area, the first portrayals
   <a href="#note4sym" name="note4anc">
    <sup>
     4
    </sup>
   </a>
   date back to the twelfth century CE ( Taddei 1958).  Islamic
iconography, instead of a human form for the demon of the eclipse,
portrays serpents or dragons with a node, or pairs of dragons with
entwined bodies. They may be autonomous images and, as it were,
complete in themselves, or form the terminal part of the signs of the
zodiac (e.g. Sagittarius), or even appear in the abstract form of a
heart-shaped knot (Hartner 1938: 138).
  </p>
  <p>
   In conclusion, unlike the substantially concordant and
ancient textual tradition, the corresponding iconographic tradition
belongs to different periods (from the sixth century CE in the Indian
area to the twelfth century CE for the Iranian area) and is
figuratively discordant, the Indian being anthropomorphic, and the
Islamic zoomorphic or abstract. And to the latter, the node theme is
fundamental.
  </p>
  <p>
   We shall now return to the entwined dragons of
Pendzikent, from which we started.
  </p>
  <p>
   Azarpay has already noted that 'The theme
of the entwined dragons in Islamic art finds Central Asian
forerunners that doubtless contributed to the widespread use of the
motif in Islamic art patronized by Turkish dynasties', citing -
among the most ancient examples - the very sculpture we have been
discussing (Azarpay 1978: 306, note 20). Thanks to the Gandharan
relief analysed above, the first appearance of the theme can be
backdated to the third-fourth centuries CE. A third image, coming
from the Iranian area and datable to the late Parthian period,
contributes to our documentation - in actual fact somewhat
scarce - for the more ancient period. I refer to a stucco
capital found at the Qal'eh-i Yazdigird ( Pl. III) -
where two rampant, divergent and knotted earth dragons appear. 'The
intertwined dragon motif on an engaged column capital clearly owes
much to the ancient traditions of Near Eastern Art, which abounds
with scenes of crossed and rampant beasts. Curiously, the closest
examples to the Qal'eh-i Yazdigird intertwined dragons must be the
pair of 'fighting dragons' from 7
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   /8
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   century Penzikent. In view of the suggested significance of the
twisted knot or 'node' in Islamic iconography an
astrological association in the case of the Qal'eh-i Yazdigird piece
should not be discounted' (Keall 1977: 7 and pl. IIIb).
  </p>
  <p>
   I consider that this latter statement of Keall's
can also be extended to the Gandharan panel and the clay sculpture we
are discussing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words, while it is certain that, from an
iconographic point of view, the Qal'eh-i Yazdigird image, the
Gandharan one and the one from Pendzikent must be considered as
forerunners of the astronomic-astrological iconography of the Islamic
period, we cannot - and perhaps should not - exclude that
this is also valid from a semantic point of view.
  </p>
  <p>
   One objection to this hypothesis may be found
however in the fact that in Islamic iconography, knotted figures -
even the various types summarized above - are indubitably an
eclipse sign when they form part of an astrological-astronomic
context, i.e. when they accompany signs of the zodiac or of stars
such as the moon. Such a context is missing in the case of the three
examples we are discussing. At the same time, Islamic iconography is
not lacking in images of knotted dragons or snakes, whether isolated
or found in different contexts, for which scholars have put forward
various interpretations.
   <a href="#note5sym" name="note5anc">
    <sup>
     5
    </sup>
   </a>
   One recurrent and more convincing reading attributes a protective and
apotropaic value, perhaps in some way connected with its primary
meaning. In this connexion, it is interesting to
recall what Ittig says about two entwined dragons ( Pl. IV) that
appear on a talismanic bowl (twelfth-fourteenth century CE?) 
 in the Toronto museum. 'According
to the oral traditions of the Arabs, the eclipse was a harbinger of
great disaster. In keeping with this is the use of entwined dragons
in Islamic gate emblems as prophylaxis against
the entry of evil spirits. The symbol of the
eclipse may therefore have been placed in the Toronto bowl to
frighten away the evil
   <i>
    ginn
   </i>
   which had entered the body of the
afflicted party' (Ittig 1982: 91 and pl. VII,a).
  </p>
  <p>
   In conclusion, my opinion is that the three portrayals
of entwined dragons we have examined do not have a merely decorative
value. The future history of the theme would lead me to propose a
reading connected with an astronomic-astrological and/or prophylactic
context. Such a hypothesis, though higly probably and reasonable,
is however far from certain. If I may, I should like to note that
several years ago, when I showed the Gandharan relief with the
dragons to Maurizio Taddei, his first comment was "Rahu and
Ketu". If accepted, such an identification would explain the
singularity of the image which, as described above, constructs the
node, not through the entwining of the two dragons' bodies, but
through the combination of one being that is "all head"
(i.e. the front part of the body) with another being that is "all
tail" (i.e. the back part of the body). Far from being the
result of the sculptor's lack of skill, such a solution could
be an effective visual expression of the myth of Rahu and Ketu, a
myth that survives in the formula '
   <i>
    caput et cauda
draconis
   </i>
   '.

   Scholars do not agree as to the
        real significance and source of the subject portrayed. Although
        Russian archaeologists incline towards a cult reading- seeing it as
        a representation of the River Zeravshan- its composition based on
        Indian models and more specifically from Grotto 5 at Udayagiri (
        Beleniskij-Piotrovskij 1959: 76-77; Belenitski 1958: 164-166),
        Verardi links the scene to Buddhist production, and more precisely
        to the aquatic scene in a chapel at Tapa Sotor (Verardi 1982:
        252-257)

   I entirely leave apart the more
        ancient history of the entwined animals theme, which does not
        directly concern the present
        case, and can be found in Azarpay 1978: 369-371

   As an extreme example of
        different readings, I cite the list of Oney 1969: 213-216, according
        to whom the dragons in Seljuk art may have the following symbolic
        meanings: 1. Symbolism of motion, harmony or universe; 2. Symbolism
        of fight against darkness and evil; 3.Symbolism  of underground and
        darkness; 4. Symbols of Cauezahr, i.e. planets; 5. The dragon year
        in the Turkish-Chinese calendar with twelve animals; 6. Water
        symbols.
