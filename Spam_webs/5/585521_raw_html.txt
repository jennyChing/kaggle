  <h2>
   Speed Reading Self-Pacing Methods
  </h2>
  <p>
   Speed reading is not magic nor is it a big expensive mystery.  Professional speed reading classes simply teach a handful of easy techniques that help a person focus his or her attention better.  The eye is drawn to motion.  Speed reading techniques put that motion on the page.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your starting position is important.  You should sit up straight, hold the book down with your left hand, and use your right hand to do the pacing.
  </p>
  <p>
   You should already be a good reader before you attempt to speed read.  Speed reading will not help you if you have problems in comprehension and vocabulary.  In fact, it may hurt you to try to rush through stuff that you can't comprehend.  You should have the basics down already first.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before you start speed reading, you should do a survey of the information first to get a general idea of what you will be covering and of the type of writing.
