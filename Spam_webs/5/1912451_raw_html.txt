      A couple months ago, someone requested that I try my hand at caramel brownies. Amazingly, this person was not my husband, but he endorsed this idea so wholeheartedly that I suspect he might have paid this person off. Then again, in most peoples minds, who
      <i>
       doesnt
      </i>
      want to make caramel brownies? What kind of strange person considers what would happen when sea salt-flecked deeply copper-colored homemade caramel meets a chewy, rich homemade brownie and then shrugs it off, Eh, Ill pass. Guys, its me. Its not that I didnt think that a salted caramel brownie could be delicious, its just that I imagine its well-trodden territory, which to me translates as people who want to make this already know how to and then I figure my time would be better spent making other things, like

       But then, as I did a quick search or two, I discovered things that caused me to make that crooked face that I made when Im thinking really hard, because sometimes after a day of explaining to a preschooler why we have to wear pants when we leave the apartment when I fully understand the desire to simply not wear pants sometimes, thinking
       <i>
        is
       </i>
       really hard. The first is that a whole lot recipes started with store-bought caramels or caramel sauce, which made me sad, because the homemade stuff requires three ingredients that you probably have, is really easy to make and the flavor comparison (especially if you add a fourth ingredient, salt)  well, there is none. They barely deserve to share the same name. The next thing that gave me pause was that they all looked achingly sweet, as if little consideration was given to the fact that dousing an already-sweet brownie with caramel sauce might cause teeth to hurt/dentists to buy new vacation homes.

       By now, I already accepted that any further resistance would be futile. I mean, if you were to distill any given Smitten Kitchen blog entry into the simplest formula, most of the time it would roughly = 2 causes of furrowed brow/

        piqued curiosity
       </a>
       + 1 polite request + 1 borderline-begging request + a notable absence of willpower. But as I got into the kitchen, I found a third source of drama, which was in how the caramel-brownie merger should be approached. Spreading half the batter in the pan, covering it with caramel, and then adding the second half of the brownie batter was kind of difficult, and the caramel filling all but disappeared into the brownie. A marbled attempt not only led to vanished caramel, but it left trenches in the brownie tops where the caramel had once been, like some sort of sad memorial. And the thing I realized was, if Im going to eat something called a caramel brownie, what Im really hoping for are parts instantly recognizable as either; I want the caramel to tangle around the brownie and vice-versa, not just dissolve into a caramel-flavored brownie.

       The only idea I had left was the craziest one, wherein you kind of fake-make caramel candies that are cold and big enough that they take longer to disappear into the the batter than the batter takes to bake. The results, however, are madness, and I urge you not to make them. Why? Why take you this far only to send you home? Because no good can come of them. Theyre ludicrously rich but not icky sweet, so its easy to forget that you should never, ever eat more than one. Theyre so loud with dark chocolate and salted caramel flavors, they might even be better than either part. Worse, theyre structurally unsound. Those squares of caramel melt into puddles that trickle out when you slice them, leaving a weak, almost gooey, chocolate foundation behind. I mean, trickling salted caramel? Gooey chocolate?

        Salted Caramel Brownies
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       I used my standard approach to salted caramel, but I dialed back the heavy cream so that it would be less soft, and therefore better able to hold up in the batter. The brownie is
       <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/08/my-favorite-brownies/">
        my one-bowl favorite
       </a>
       , with less salt and sugar to compensate for the sweetness and extra salt in the caramel. The result is a soft, messy brownie that it much, much, much easier to cut neatly if placed in the freezer until semi-firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes 1 88 pan of brownies which you can cut into 16 2-inch squares, 25 smaller squares, 32 21-inch bites or a mess of hearts from a cookie cutter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <u>
        Caramel
       </u>
       <br/>
       1/2 cup granulated sugar
       <br/>
       4 tablespoons unsalted butter (or salted, but then ease up on the sea salt)
       <br/>
       Heaped 1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt (or 1/8 teaspoon table salt, more to taste)
       <br/>
       3 tablespoons heavy cream
      </p>
      <p>
       <u>
        Brownie
       </u>
       <br/>
       3 ounces (85 grams) unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped
       <br/>
       1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, plus extra for pan
       <br/>
       1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
       <br/>
       2 large eggs
       <br/>
       1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
       <br/>
       Heaped 1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt or 1/8 teaspoon table salt
       <br/>
       2/3 cup (85 grams) all-purpose flour
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Make caramel:
       </em>
       Set a square of parchment paper over a medium-sized plate. Lightly butter or coat the parchment with a spray oil, just as an added security measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medium, dry saucepan over medium-high heat, melt your sugar; this will take about 5 minutes, stirring if necessary to break up large chunks. By the time it is all melted, if should be a nice copper color; if not, cook until it is. Remove from heat and stir in butter. It may not incorporate entirely but do your best. Stir in cream and salt and return saucepan to the stove over medium-high heat, bringing it back to a simmer and melted again any sugar that solidified. Cook bubbling caramel for a few minutes more, until it is a shade darker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pour out onto parchment-covered plate and transfer plate to your freezer. Freeze until solidified, which can take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes in a decent freezer to 40 minutes in my terrible one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Meanwhile, or when your caramel is almost firm, make your brownies:
       </em>
       Heat oven to 350F. Line an 88-inch square baking pan with parchment, extending it up two sides. Butter the parchment or spray it with a nonstick cooking spray.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medium heatproof bowl over gently simmering water, melt chocolate and butter together until only a couple unmelted bits remain. Off the heat, stir until smooth and fully melted. You can also do this in the microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring between each. Whisk in sugar, then eggs, one at a time, then vanilla and salt. Stir in flour with a spoon or flexible spatula.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Assemble brownies:
       </em>
       When caramel is firm, remove it from the freezer and chop it into rough 1-inch squares. Gently fold all but a small amount of caramel bits into batter. Scrape batter into prepared pan, spreading until mostly even. Scatter remaining caramel bits on top. Bake in heated oven for 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool thoroughly  a process that can be hastened in the freezer, which will also produce cleaner cuts  and cut into squares or other desired shapes.

If youre casting about for more ideas, though, I would love to see some recipes with that delicious big flake coconut that I just discovered at my organic market I am a coco-nutter, and would love to try the SK recipe for that good stuff!

       WOW! looks amazing. I think I would just pour the caramel on top of the cooked brownies as a frosting, that way if I wanted to just eat the top with a few brownie crumbs I could. How many hours until I can get home and make these?! YUM!

       Oh, Deb. I am seven months pregnant and coincidentally a huge fan of both chewy brownies and salted caramel. I will be making these this weekend, and oh darn, eating for two. I may also let a scoop of really good, simple vanilla ice cream melt over the tops just a bit

       Ive been wanting to make a caramel brownie, but I really didnt want to use store bought caramels. I thought caramel frosting, but I am a firm believer that even the chewiest of brownies becomes cake with the addition of frosting.

       Thank you for brightening my morning with this glorious post. Since the caramel only requires 3 tablespoons of heavy cream, do you think I might be able to get away with using half &amp; half (instead of purchasing a container of heavy cream the entirety of which would sadly go unused)?

       Im gonna attempt to make those but heres what will happen: Ill make the caramel, try to eat it (all) will cooking, burn my tongue, wait for the rest to cool off, eat the rest and then make chocolate brownies (without caramels).
       <br/>
       Any suggestion on how to solve this impasse?

       After meeting you in November, Im finally getting up the courage to comment! Any more bouts of this kind of courage, and I might have to go have a bit of a lie down.

       Your objections to most caramel brownies are the same as mine: too sickly sweet and the delicious flavors combine to make a meh flavor.  This is what makes your recipe so dangerous.  If you have the same general indifference to caramel brownies that I do, and you still love (or love-hate for how good it is) this recipe, then I probably will too!  Oh the horror.

       Only tangentially related to this post/these brownies, but I just have to say how happy I am to see all these posts lately! I know youre heading back out on the road, so to speak, but Im so happy to get a dip, salad, soup, pasta, and (two!) desserts to play with before you go. And, of course, the recipes Ive bookmarked in your actual book :-)

       Just curious, does the caramel harden once the brownies are cold?  Do the brownies have a chance to get cold or are they eaten in one sitting?  Thanks.

       I make my own version of caramel brownies, with the requisite homemade caramel. They have been dubbed Confession Brownies by a individual who will remain nameless to protect all the innocent. Being a good Catholic that he is, after the first bite he said Oh God, I think I need to go to confession now. They are the cause of much rejoicing in certain circles when I make them. P.S. Try adding a teaspoon (or two) of soy sauce to your caramel in place of the salt. Just trust me :)

       @Margherita- just make a double-batch or caramel! Use two pots, then you can eat one while continuing the brownie recipe. :-)

       I second #27s question. Once these cool, does the caramel become hardened? I guess I really want to know if these will travel/be good the next dayif they dont get eaten before then.

       Katie  No, its more of a firmish caramel sauce, not a hard caramel candy.

       ) but I really, really like the idea of the caramel oozing out in pockets rather than smoothly smeared on top.

       I love that you made caramel and then worked it into the brownies in big, chunky, gorgeous pieces! Most people who make caramel brownies drizzle on some jarred ice cream topping but clearly that wouldnt be your style and am glad you made this recipe rather than going with your people who want to make this already know how to logic. I love these!
      </p>
      <p>
       And love that your brownies are super dense and fudgy and beyond rich looking!

       Thanks for perfecting the caramel brownie Deb! I recently tried a gluten free version at a friends place and had the same thought: this could be so much better if it wasnt so sweet. And with the small amount of flour in the brownie portion of your recipe, this will be easily converted into the best gluten free caramel brownie!

       Thank goodness you posted these!  I was wondering how I could use up the chocolate from the last time I made the brownies and some heavy cream I have!  ;)

       Heavy cream really makes caramel. The fat is needed. However, heavy cream cant go to waste. Use it in eggs, make whipped cream, add it to anything you add milk. A little more decadent, but it wont be wasted. Plus the stuff lasts forever.

       Amazing.  Ive been looking for a salted caramel choc-chip cookie recipe all week and  was frustrated at every recipe that called for Kraft caramels (or store-bought).  Insanity that no one else bothered to make the caramel!

       What perfect timing this was  thank you!

       The French have a word, mignon, which translates roughly to adorable. And while Im not a big chocolate fan, I am a slave to all things caramel, and when you make it heart shaped, well, trs mignon!

       Oh, my gracious. I was just craving come brownies but Im afraid to make these because I would eat the whole pan. I love making caramel  its like kitchen magic (much like making buttercream) and I think it is coo-coo-crazy that people would every resort to using store-bought.

       How do we think these will hold up in a care package? Is the caramel too gooey to ship them, or will freezing the brownies before shipping them make them sturdy enough?

       Deb, I have been searching for the right recipe for this, also having had my own struggles. Thank you so much! And Jasmine, on the margarine  dont do it! Your caramel will seize up, I think because there is more water in margarine. I tried it and ruined a whole batch. Butter is the only way here.

       Deb, Will we get good results using your Best Cocoa Brownies (

        http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/01/best-cocoa-brownies/
       </a>
       ) recipe here?  I love those brownies. Theyre not overly sweet, so I thought they might be a good partner with the caramel.  More importantly, I have cocoa powder and no chocolate in my pantry.  Just want to make sure that there werent any issues before I start these.  I dont want to waste ingredients.
      </p>

       I cannot tell you without embarrassing myself how many times I have made this, your latest brownie recipe.  You could probably tell by looking at me, though.  This is just sinful, Deb, and my husband has been grousing at me to make something.   Wellokay then, Ill make these, already.

       These look amazing and Im going to bake them on Monday! Do you recommend reheating them before serving them, so that the caramel becomes liquidy again? Or are they ok at room temperature?

       Hello! This looks *awesome*. Thank you!
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped by originally to comment that I had that I wonder moment in a posh grocery store where I was buying dark chocolate discs to make your chocolate chip cookies. I picked up a bunch of their peanut butter chips and though  what would this be like with the one-bowl brownie recipe?
      </p>
      <p>
       At home, I ate some of the chips and they were a little sweetish and not peanutty enough. So I modified your brownie recipe as follows, but I figured Id give you my idea and let you have fun with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 oz peanut butter chips
       <br/>
       2 TB butter (probably should have used 1)
       <br/>
       1/4 c peanut butter (Jif, if youre curious)
       <br/>
       2/3 c sugar
       <br/>
       2 eggs
       <br/>
       1 tsp salt
       <br/>
       1 tsp vanilla
       <br/>
       2/3 c flour
      </p>
      <p>
       I sprinkled kosher salt on top because for me the ideal peanut buttery thing is peanut brittle sweet and salty. The kosher sprinkles kinda disappeared but left their memory in the baked brownie top. My husband pronounced them wonderful, but theyre still not quite right to my mind. What would you change, I wonder? :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for being you, and being wonderful. Peace.

       Arguing with your preschooler about wearing pants literally made me laugh out loud in my cube. We regularly have to have this conversation with our 3 year old son ug, boys!  Mine LOVES anything chocolate, so these will have to go on the must bake list, you know after I work myself through your cookbook.

       I was really hoping your next post would include chocolate.  I love making heart brownies but Ive never liked the caramel sauce or whatever baked into a great chocolate brownie.  I like your approach to the caramel and now I have to try it.  Thank you so very much.

       and this is why i love smitten kitchen i made some gorgeous-looking salted caramel brownies via pinterest  which sadly turned out to be kinda-caramel-flavored-cheesecake-swirled-brownies (why did i not realize that the large amount of cream cheese in the recipe would lead to that??)
       <br/>
       i love the thought you put into this will be making asap :)

       Caramel brownies are one of my specialties.  I started making them several years ago after have one at Fat Witch in Chelsea Market.  I do make my own caramel and do half the brownie batter, then the caramel layer, then the rest of the batter.  The trick is to make sure your caramel is thick enough to not dissolve into the brownie.  I like your method too.  The puddles of caramel look fantastic!

       Deb and Jasmine  YES I made caramel sauce from your Apple Tart recipe with Earth Balance Vegan Butter and it worked great! I assume it would work for this firmer caramel recipe as well. I also used Silk Soy heavy creamer. Vegan caramel thats still delicious  who knew!

       for those who are scared of making caramel, ive previously used thick (and cold) dulce de leche in Debs one bowl brownies, drizzling/swirling it haphazardly on top right before going in the oven, and had good results.

       My method for the merge of caramel and brownie was to cook the brownie for a little while before pouring the caramel over top. Worked pretty well but like you I had some issues with structural stability, especially towards the middle of the pan! Tasted great though!

       I was wondering what to do with that 100% cacao bar in my cabinet! Lucky enough to have time to make these as soon as I saw the recipe. They are in the oven now. Very straightforward recipe, although my caramel did not take as long as yours to finish. That also happened to me with your caramel popcorn. Maybe because I have an electric range?
      </p>
      <p>
       Excited to see how they stack up vs the Knock You Naked Brownies which are great but toothache-sweet.

       Petra  Heavy cream and whipping cream can be used interchangeably most places, including here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliza  Probably? I dont see why not, but of course havent tried it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Di  I dont have a lot of experience mailing things, but Id say these are definitely on the messier side. You can freeze them, but wont that just buy you a few hours? Theyre not going to go bad, though, or not quickly. Theyll just be messy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nic  Yes, absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emily  Id go with leveled quarter-teaspoons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half and half  I have, sadly, never tried to make caramel with it. Maybe someone who has will pipe up and let folks know if its worked for them? Thanks!

       Oh my god this sounds incredible! My brother is home this weekend, and I havent seen him in ages- I think these are the perfect welcome home bake for him! Not that I expect them to stick around, but can anyone advise how long these would be good for before going stale etc?

       Alice  Theyre not going to go stale because theyre too moist. They might, however, go bad faster at room temperature due to all the moisture. I might keep them in the fridge. (In actuality, I keep them in the freezer because my husband and I adore frozen brownies!)

       They look fabulous. I really crave these right now, which is really bad, due to the fact that I dont have an oven before 25 February :(  Ill have to track one down an oven in the weekend.

       I made the caramel sauce for your apple mosaic tart with 2 tablespoons of non-fat milk instead of the recommended heavy cream. It came out great for me. I wasnt trying to make any healthy changes or anything. I just had non-fat milk and didnt want to buy heavy cream. The caramel recipe here is nearly the same, so I am thinking that one could sub nearly any milk product for the heavy cream and have it turn out. Maybe I am wrong here, as I have never tried it, but I just wanted to share my experience.

       By the way, how sticky is the caramel? Can you eat it if you have braces? Or can you perhaps replace it with something else equally delicious??? I have never tried to bake with or make caramel, but now I have to try. Beautiful pictures.

       Oh my sweet lord, Deb, I swear youve been reading my mind/dreams. This is EXACTLY the dessert Ive been dreaming of the last few weeks! I have never made my own caramel, so I didnt think of this, but I did add some peanut butter to your cocoa brownie recipe which staved off the craving for a minute, but now that these have come into my life I dont think I can ever go back. THANK YOU!

      <p>
       Do you have a suggestion on what kind of flaky sea salt to use? I know you say that regular salt works as well, but Id like to try the flaky sea salt  if only I can figure out what kind to get &amp; where to get it!
      </p>

       I really wish this post had existed earlier this week. I saw what looked like amazing Dulce de Leche Brownies on Pinterest and knew I needed them in my life, but ended up with the same issues you had, the dulce de leche just soaked into the brownies so you had no idea that it was there. These look like the perfect solution! Im looking forward to re-testing the brownies using your recipe and hopefully they look as amazing as yours came out :).

       These look amazing! I am wondering if you have ever made whiskey brownies? I saw a recipe recently but the base was almost meringue and that sounded too insubstantial for me (whiskey doesnt go with light in my book). Just thought Id ask and perhaps youd add it to your list of future posts :)

       Wow. Just, wow. Are you reading my mind, Deb? I just had an idea earlier today: rich chocolate cookies with puffed crispy rice and toasted coconut how to incorporate caramel? Any suggestions for the perfect cookie??? Also: do you know of a dairy-free caramel that doesnt immediately seize up? Ive had no luck before. Thanks!

       What brand of chocolate is your favorite for baking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Id also love to see pics of the failed batches of things. Have you ever considered linking to those? I know this sounds like an odd suggestion, but it can sometimes be so illuminating to compare the perfected product with the failed tries.

       Might I just say, AMEN: these look fabulous.  And cutting them with a cookie cutter?  Genius, because then someone must (*sigh*) immediately eat the left-over scraps.  Such hardship.

       I do something similar with David Lebovitzs dry caramel! 1/2 cup sugar melted til caramel-y colored, then toss in 1 tsp or so sea salt, swirl to mix, and then pour onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or a baking liner. Tip the pan around so it spreads thinly, and then when it hardens, just break it up into tiny pieces. I make Bakers one-bowl brownies, less the sugar from the caramel, and mix in the caramel right before they go in the oven. DE-LISH! I may have to try this next time

       I often make caramel with half and half because I always have it on hand for coffee. It works for me, and a couple of others here also vouched! I have also tried skim milk which works but the caramel isnt nearly as rich. To accommodate a dairy allergy I have also made a caramel sauce with almond milk. It needed continuous stirring and was very thin (the color was also a bit different, much lighter,  even after my first attempt when I cooked it WAY too long)

       Anhar  I really like Maldon. Not sure where you are, thus, where you can buy it but in NYC, its available a lot of places, from Whole Foods to other grocery stores. It can also be ordered online.
      </p>
      <p>
       ATG  I dont always take photos. (When I do, I usually share them.) Sometimes Im just trying out theories in the kitchen to see what will happen and I come back to them with the camera out when Im more confident Ill get it right.

       Chocolate brands  I love Valrhona (who doesnt?) but tend to most frequently use a mix of Scharffen-Berger (for unsweetened) and Guittard. Guittard is harder to find, but worth seeking out. Im totally into their baking discs (wafers, they call them, but like 3/4-inch flat chocolate chips, so they melt well but can be coarsely chopped when you want something closer to chocolate chips) and keep them around in

       . I think the 1# boxes list for $12, but I get them for $10 from Fresh Direct in NYC, which I think is a pretty great value for excellent baking chocolate.

       I baked these immediately after reading Never made homemade caramel before and am surprised at how easy it is to make! The caramel didnt harden like yours did but still insanely good in the brownies! I love how rich and chocolatey these are We had a small square each with red wine It was just perfect! Folks, dont wait for valentines day to make this!

       Hi Deb! Have you ever tried using nonstick (coated) foil instead of bothering with greasing parchment paper? Much easier, nothing sticks to the stuff, plus it molds nicely to the container, unlike paper. Try it, I think youll be sold.

       Reading this recipe made me realize the thing I miss most in your (otherwise yummylicious) book: your great step-by-step photos! Not that they are exactly necessary (your instructions are always clear), but they help me soooooo much whenever I feel insecure at any given step (Oh my God, am I doing this right?).

      <p>
       I recently made some dark chocolate salted caramels for my partner, and to make the caramel I used sugar &amp; water, which i set over a heat and didnt stir until it was a nice dark amber, and then added double cream while stirring maniacally and praying to leave this sugar experiment without burn marks. This is a caramel recipe Ive used in the past and I know it sets into soft candies, so I simply amped up the amount of double cream to get it a bit runnier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Butter didnt feature in my caramel recipe am I doing it wrong? Am I doing it not-wrong-per-se, but did-you-hear-butter-makes-things-better? Or are there simply a variety of ways to make caramel?

       I, too, will be making these.  Soon.  But I was wondering whether you had any temperature guide for making the caramel?  I find that when I try to make caramel visually, I take it too far and end up with over  um  caramelization.
       <br/>
       Thanks.

       Deb, I wanted to answer the question someone asked about using margarine instead of butter.  I have made your Apple Cider Caramels using margarine AND full fat coconut milk, instead of the heavy cream, to make them dairy free.  They were FABULOUS.  In a side by side comparison with ones made with butter and heavy cream, we couldnt tell the difference.  My son has multiple food allergies so ingredient substitution is something I do a lot of.  Hope this helps.

       For those who dont like buying cream that you wont use all of:  David Lebovitz recommended freezing it a few months ago:
       <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2012/10/can-i-freeze-cream-heavy-whipping/" rel="nofollow">
        http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2012/10/can-i-freeze-cream-heavy-whipping/

       I cant eat chocolate so no brownies for me but caramel blondies are the best recipe Ive ever created.  They also took by far the most time to perfect.

       Samantha, making the caramel was by far easier than unwrapping a bunch of store bought caramels. Not to mention better tasting, less expensive, and better quality.

       Okay.amazing.I substituted banana for butter in my brownie recipe last week and my family complained.  I thought they wereamazing, chocolate banana brownies, but they needed something.  I think it is caramel.

       Making these brownies will sure beat cleaning out my closet during the impending  New England snow storm.  This is recipe is reason enough to encounter the crowds in the supermarket just to buy the heavy cream.

       These look insanely delicious!  I must try these.  My husband hates desserts, but can polish off half a tray of brownies in one sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill confess that every time I make homemade brownies, they just never compare to a box of ghirardelli brownie mix.  Ive probably just never used a good recipe, or maybe my brownie skills just suck.  Anyway, Im definitely giving these a whirl.  Thank you.

       What makes these extra good is that they are not TOO sweet. So when I added chopped pecans and used them to make turtle brownie sundaes, they harmonized well with the ice cream, hot fudge, and whipped cream (the same whipped cream as in your icebox cake). Another great recipe, Deb!

       Echoing the disbelief and mild horror over so many recipes calling for store-bought caramels. On some level, it seems like itd be more trouble to try to track down a jar or box of them than to just make them myself  and if Im going to make brownies, I might as well not hold back.

       I am 4 months pregnant and craving those brownieswho am I kidding? I would eat those ANYTIME! Instead of cutting the caramel into squares and integrating into the batter, I am going to try layering the caramel sheet in between the chocolate. Really get that layered effect in each bite. Thinking maybe it wont cut so well???

       I used regular salt and whole milk in a pinch and they turned out great.   (I would never sub margarine for butter though unless there is a food allergy)   Margarine is worse for you than butter and doesnt taste nearly as good

       Deb, thanks for this. My husbands all-time favorite dessert is a salty caramel cupcake from Sprinkes, with brownie sundae in a close second. I tried making salted caramel brownies (his two fav things in one dessert) for his birthday last year but it was sort of a flop. The gooey caramel didnt mesh well with the the brownie batter and Im sure looked like one of first attempts that you had. This year for his bday I will be making YOUR salted caramel brownies, which so much more promise of success. Thanks!

       BTW for all those light cream, half and half questions, here is your answer: you must use heavy cream, the lower fat options have too much water, and will not make caramel!

       Oh wow. These look AMAZING. I was a little late to the game in realizing how good the interplay of salt + sugar in chocolate is, but I am now a believer. Although I already bought husband a V-day gift, I may have to add these in.

       So glad you posted this recipe! I have also searched for homemade salted caramel brownie recipes in the past, thinking it would be quite common. Only to become disheartened that every recipe I found involved unwrapping, and melting a bag of caramel candy! Thank you thank you!

       Made these last night! SO SO delicious! One tip, be careful when melting your sugar. my first time I made the caramel with burnt sugar and it was awful. I suggest melting it over low-medium heat and if it looks darker than a golden coppery color, its probably burnt!

       I for one will NOT be peeling chickpeas but making caramel is another matter entirely.

       @ Carole #203, try substituting the darkest chocolate you can find.  85% cacoa would probably work fine and add only a very little sweetness.  Or use your favorite brownie recipe with the caramels.

       Hi Carole  Im in Germany and have found 95% chocolate from Lindt.  Or, you can use semi-sweet (75-85%) and adjust the sugar accordingly  Debs Heart of Darkness (or something like that) brownies are essentially that recipe.

       Some have said you can make this caramel with a lower fat dairy than heavy cream. I havent made this one (but will soon!) but have ruined on two separate occasions a pot of caramel when the half and half curdled and caused a grainy mess. Remaking it the same day with cream resulted in luscious caramel and no curdling both times. I guess there isnt enough fat to keep the proteins from coagulating when its added to a really hot sugar syrup. Heavy cream has never ruined anything. I mean, its basically liquid butter so how could it?
      </p>
      <p>
       (BTW Ive read your blog for years (YEARS!) but never commented. For once, I guess I felt I had something to add.)

       these are so incredibly delicious and beautiful! i am relatively new to your site but im already a huge fan. everything ive made has been perfect! carrot soup with chickpeas and hummus, hummus, challah, and now these. i better start checking out your veggie recipes
       <br/>
       ive never made caramel before- anyone have any suggestions for how to clean the pot and spoon that has caramel hardened on it? theyve been soaking for a while now.

       @Carole,  I often use this substitute for unsweetened chocolate: for each ounce required, mix 3 tablespoons cocoa with one tablespoon oil.

       There are two options on what I can do with this recipe.  Show it my wife, eat some of these amazing brownies and then feel regret over breaking my diet.  Or I can not show it to her go eat a carrot and then regret not showing the recipe to her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well since theres going to be regret either way I might was well have a brownie or two

       You know what would be really good with this?  Making the caramel brownies in a pan layered on the bottom with sliced pears, more like a cake.  I think I have a weekend project.

       I agree with Charm. Making caramel without a temperature is flying blind in my book. There are so many things that affect the perception of color (lighting, pan color, etc) that I refuse to make any caramel recipe without a candy thermometer.
       <br/>
       Maybe Ill make a different caramel recipe and then add it to the brownies the way you did.

       This recipe can be more easily made by using Ghirardelli Brownie Mix, spreading half of the mixture in the pan, top with good caramel candies sliced on top, then top off
       <br/>
       with remaining brownie mix.  Bake according to package directions.  While brownies
       <br/>
       are cooling, spread Trader Joes Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce on top and a sprinkle of
       <br/>
       fleur de sel salt.  Delicious and decadent.  Try it!

       Amazing!  I think I actually followed the recipe on this one with just one exception, I used semi-sweet choc squares.  I think the sweetness was just right for us, but we prefer things on the sweeter side.  I even cut them with a heart shaped cookie cutter.  Super fun and so perfect for our snow day today!  Thanks!

       I was at The BookShop on West Portal (in San Francisco) this morning.  Guess what?????  I saw your book RIGHT NEXT to Ina Gartens latest cookbook.  Youll be happy to know it was in a prominent place on a table near the cashier.  I was soooo happy for you I practically jumped up and down.  I had my hands full, plus purse and dog and was in a rush or Id have picked it up, written a note and slipped it in.  I have to go back.  My note will say:  Buy this book!  Deb is a wonderful, creative cook, her writing keeps me reading her blog everyday.  Youll thank me.  Anything youd like to add?

       Help!  I just finished the recipe, but all of the carmel (which turned out perfectly) sunk to the bottom of the batter mix including the carmels I scattered on the top.  When I cut into them, theyre like a brownie with a carmel layer on the bottom.  Any idea what I should do different next time?  And, they only took 20 minutes in the oven until the toothpick came out clean.

       I made them today and they are absolutely delicious. I was afraid my caramel was too dark and too bitter, but it turned out good. I also made the perfect lemon bars from your book. Awesome snowy day (near my stove) here in Montral !

       I dont usually like brownies  too sweet and gooey, and they remind me of adolescence. But your preamble won me over, and I made these today. They are positively life-changing.
       <br/>
       Next time (tomorrow?) I may try them with toasted pecans, as somebody suggested.
       <br/>
       Thank you!

       Salted caramel is a favorite of mine.  I cant handle sweet without a bit of salt.  It makes it just perfectbalanced.  It makes sense.   These are adorable and I bet, just as tasty.

       Made these today, an epic fail. Carmel did not harden, I finally rolled it into small balls and put in my chest freezer for an hour and they were still soft and gooey. The carmel melted and made little sink holes in the brownies, they fell apart when I cut them. They tasted alright but not worth the time and ingredients. Luckily 16 year old boys will eat anything.

       I just made these. I had toits snowy and windy, and what else can I do when a recipe calling for salted caramel comes my way? But I had no heavy cream in the house, so I used a mixture of half melted butter and half low fat milk for the salted caramel. It seems to have worked! The brownies are still warm, so it remains to be seen how they cool, but warm they are aamaaazing.

       Thanks Deb.  Were gonna try these.  Last weekend we made the Pioneer Womans caramel brownies because I made the mistake of sendng it to my daughter with the title Diabetic Coma.  They had SO MUCH caramel that our teeth DID ache, we could only eat them in 1 squares and we made everyone who walked in the house take some home.  We LOVE caramel brownies and this looks lighter.

       I left this page open on my computer and my kids went nuts when they wandered over to see the pics! PLEASE, PLEASE MOMMY, MAKE THESE!! I indulged them tonight and these totally lived up to the hype.  Ah-MAZING.  I followed recipe and with the addition of roasted, salted pecans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: When making caramel, after I added in the cream and butter, I bought it back to a boil just for a minute or two. The caramel was very, very soft and hard to h

       handle. Be sure to cook it a good bit after the butter/cream addition.

       Made these tonight w/hersheys deep dark cocoa powder and oil .. also didnt let my caramel firm up long enough (call me pregnant and impatient) so a bunch disappeared as I folded it in .. leaving me to wonder .. could I pour my batter into my pan, maybe half first, poke in some caramels, top the other half of my batter in, poke in some caramels? Hmm a great excuse to make another batch for another day. These are amazing. Thank you &lt;3

       Well, for the record, when you misread 4 Tbs butter as 4oz butter for the caramel, it doesnt work all that well. Doubling the butter resulted in a caramel that did harden, but needless to say it was rather thin, and the caramels in the brownie batter disappeared entirely while those on the top hardened Too bad, Ill just have to try again soon. The brownies themselves are delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who decided butter should be measured in tablespoons, anyway??

       Im snowed in with plans for cooking and baking up a storm (no pun intended). I swung on over to Smitten Kitchen to cross check an apple pie recipe and I was stopped by this recipe. Now my plans include three pies, cinnamon buns, marshmallows, cookies and these brownies. I have no will power when it comes to caramel.

       Deb, I feel your pain about the terrible freezer.  11 years ago, when I first moved in with my now-husband, the refigerator/freezer in his house was really old.  The freezer could keep something like a TV dinner frozen (he lived off of them before he wised up and asked me to move in) but not ice cream.  I remember whenever we bought ice cream, we had to eat the whole pint in one sitting.  It was rough.  I always think of that when you mention your terrible freezer.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       On a recipe-related note: these look amazing.  Hoping I have a co-worker with a birthday coming up so I can make them.  Otherwise, I am afraid I would make them at home and eat the whole pan.

       Well, darn.  My caramel came out great although I may have cooked it a bit too long.  I was going for a nice dark color and flavor but it looks like it might have ended up being more crisp than yours  the end texture was more like english toffee.  I definitely did not get oozing puddles of caramel deliciousness.  Like a few others, mine fell through the batter and some, not all, ended up on the bottom, melted into hard pools of caramel.  The taste is okay although I like a darker chocolate brownie.  Back to the drawing board.  I added a sprinkling of sanding sugar mixed with Maldon salk flakes (from Bakeds caramel brownies) right after they came out of the oven which I think is a really nice touch.  That photo with the caramel dripping out of the brownie looks like heaven!

       Deb, did your caramel have a soft, chewy texture similar to a store bought caramel?  If so, I cooked mine too long. That might be the answer  giving up is not an option!

       My carmel sunk but I had some extra and set it on the warm brownies (over the lost carmel holes) and it melted to a lovely goo filling the holes.

       I just made these for my boyfriends birthday after the wintery nastiness outside nixed my previous plan to take him out for dinner. They were very easy to make and were super delicious, especially when we ate them warm and gooey with butter pecan ice cream.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that I noticed about the recipe was that my sugar caramelized to a deep copper brown in about two minutes (instead of five) on medium-high heat; thankfully, I smelled the caramel, turned off the heat, and stirred until everything was a uniform color. After that, though, the caramels turned out wonderfully. So if youve got a little candy-making experience as I have, keep a close eye on the heat (maybe use medium heat to give yourself a little more leeway) and use your nose to tell if things are starting to edge toward burning. It should smell pleasant and brown (if that makes sense), not like burning sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you as always, Deb, for a wonderful recipe!

       Insane! My caramels sank too. Do you think this happens if the caramel is not appropriately chilled? I let them sit on the counter in the warm kitchen while getting the oven temp correct (thanks to typical NYC oven with unmarked thermostat knob).

       These are amazing! I panfried  some pecan halves in a little grape seed oil and a pinch of sugar and salt (left the salt out of the batter) and they made amazing turtle brownies. The only thing my fianc suggested was a cakier brownie. How would one achieve that?

       Finished making these a few hours ago, and they are yummy. However, despite the fact that my caramel was rock hard when it went in, it still melted into the brownies and did not leave big gooey pieces like pictured. Kind of bummed, because the caramel was amazing on its own but you cant really pick it out in the brownies. :( hopefully my neighbours still like them, theyre getting some as a thank you for snow blowing our driveway this morning!

       Like a couple other posters, no amount of time in the freezer would harden my caramel (it was a gooey, delicious mess). What is this indicative of? Too much cream? Not enough time in boiling? Other? Please help; caramel has always been my nemesis!
      </p>
      <p>
       I confess, I made extra caramel for an extra treat, and the flavor was outstanding. My girls and I stood around the parchment paper and unapologetically scraped it off with our fingers Yum!

       When I made your recipe for My Favorite Brownies  I told my self.this is it, your brownies search is over.  These are the perfect brownie and no other brownie will ever come close to matching its wonderfulness.  Then you came out with these.  I was visiting my sister last night and she begged me to make these; they did not disappoint.  I was a little nervous about making caramel but with your direction it came out perfectly!
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit that I didnt add enough of the caramel to the mixture.  I only added a small amount and the top of the brownies were swimming in caramel.  When I make these again, I think Im going to try to add half of the caramel to the mixture and then half on top to see if I get a better ratio.

       I could not stop thinking about these ever since you posted themwhen I decided to brave the weather here in the northeast to drive to the market the kids were not so sure it was a good idea.  I said, I have 5 words for youSmitten. Kitchen. Salted. Caramel. Brownies.  and they replied, off you go!  They were the best ever!  I even cut them into hearts as I did not want to disappoint.

       Thinking is totally hard sometimes! I always appreciate the amount of thought that goes into your recipes, Debthese brownies being no exception. Im not the biggest fan of caramel, but I think thats because the store-bought stuff is no good. Cant imagine I wouldnt get weak in the knees if presented with the homemade kind (butter, sugar and cream, hello!).

       A question: I never made caramels before and was surprised by how easy your recipe was, and how delicious they were when I took them out of the freezer. Out of curiosity, I looked at other recipes and they all ask for corn syrup  is it because they are making candies and we are putting it in a brownie?

       Wow! And I guess that the reason you used a heart-shaped cutter instead of just slicing into squares had ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the fact there would be scraps that needed clearing up?! Nothing at all! What a shame! Waste not want not! I must use a cutter next time! :-)

       I just made these and while they are wonderful and gooey, my carmel seems to have just incorporated into the batter.  It was pretty soft and gooey by itself when I cut it.

      <p>
       Did I cook it too long or not enough do you suppose?

       My family loves them but I was hoping for those pockets of pretty caramel.

       Yesterday I was depressed about losing my iPod and when I saw this recipe I jumped up off the couch and got to work  it was a great distraction!  The recipe is great.  I used half and half and the caramel turned out great!  I did have some trouble with freezing it  I left it in the freezer for about an hour and it still softened really quickly when I was cutting it up (maybe due to the half and half?) but I did the best I could to keep it in chunks.  I had to bake for a bit longer than the recommended time too, but in the end these were GREAT.  The caramel stayed in little pockets and the brownies were so chewy and delicious.

       I got to spend the weekend with my parents at home and was going to suggest to my mom that we make these (she is the one who introduced me to Smitten Kitchen)!  Much to my surprise, these brownies were waiting for me when I got home, so instead we had to make Ethereally Smooth Hummus (it is actually kind of fun to pop! the chickpeas out of their skins) and Intensely Chocolate Sables.  All three were (not are  theres no more left) fantastic!

       From the moment I received the email with this recipe, I could not think about anything else than making itand I resisted for about 5 hours!
       <br/>
       I was surprised with how easy making caramel is (and cleaning the pan, I thought I would just have to throw it away when actually the caramel dissolved in the hot water).
       <br/>
       The brownie was amazing except the sides which turned into hard caramel (Carambar for any French reader!). When I put the caramel squares into the batter, they were firm but not hard, do you think that was the problem? I really wish to understand what went wrong because Im sure Ill be doing it again!
       <br/>
       Thanks for your help.

       Count me as another person whose caramel simply refused to firm up (despite three hours [!] in the freezer), and so instead got incorporated into the batter, turning it pretty much uniform. The result is a cross between a gooey brownie and fudge which I have been unable to stop eating for the last hour, so PLEASE tell me how to never make this happen again. (Om nom nom nom nom.)

       As my husband and I approach the last few brownies that I made we keep ratcheting up our love for them. At first it was, These are pretty tasty! to, I think I might like these more than the last time you made brownies. to, Seriously, these are the best flipping brownies, ever! Should you start making more immediately?
      </p>
      <p>
       These were super good. I also had the caramel sinking into he brownie issue, though only around the perimeter of my pan. Not as pretty as Debs bit I could care less  they were delicious!

       I made these Friday as the snow swirled in Connecticut.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfectly.  Easier to make than it seems, dont be put off by the caramel making.  Its really quite simple.  DELICIOUS!  Will not be last time I make them.:)

       Making these now, and my caramel out of the freezer is not chewy at all, it is hard like toffee.  Not sure what went wrong.  Soldiering on anyway, because toffee brownies are probably not a bad thing.

       @Peter  will you let us know how they turn out fresh from the oven? A lot of us couldnt get the caramel to set at all, so Im wondering if yours come out of the oven just right.

       Caramel firmness  The caramel should not be hard when it comes out of the freezer, actually on the soft side, but firm enough that you can cut it into sticky/stretchy separate squares. If the pieces soften quickly, thats fine. If they seem chewy and want to stick together, thats fine too. Just do your best to separate them into bits, and stir them in. The important thing is getting them into separate islands of caramel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marietta  I dont find corn syrup necessary to make caramel sauce of candies, though some people find that makes it easier for people to make at home. My friend David Lebovitz talks in more depth about how and why and when it is used

       Chocolate varieties  These brownies are at their absolute best with unsweetened chocolate. If you cant find it, use the highest percentage chocolate you can and dial back the sugar a little in the brownie.

       My caramel turned out exactly as described.  Makes me wonder why I though all caramel recipes involved juggling thermometers and pots of hard boiled sugar hardened beyond anything good. Nope, this was easy, and the result is yummy.

       This is my second attempt at making these Im not sure wat went wrong both times but it was a buttery mess, the brownies did not rise, and the consistency was watery and did not harden after 45+ minutes of baking. I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference I could think is maybe using organic cane sugar ( instead of refined) and organic flour? Would this cause this recipe to fail? Was baking powder needed? It was not listed as an ingredient.  I really would love to make these , however after 2 attempts I will stick with cooking and not baking!

       I made these brownies and they are delish!  Incredibly easy to make actual hands on time is probably 10 minutes all total after letting the caramel sit in the freezer.  Big hit!

       @James: Fresh from the oven, the caramel/toffee was soft, but definitely more toffee-sticky than caramel-gooey; you could tell something was wrong.  A few hours later, its back to hard toffee, which doesnt pair well with soft brownies.  My guess is that I cooked the caramel for too long on the stove.  Ill try again soon, being extra careful to cook the caramel for less time.

       We made these yesterday and they are wonderful. Intense chocolate flavor in the brownies and amazingly creamy caramel. I could eat the whole batch of caramel before it went into the brownies. My husband and I had a small one each and sent them to the office for Treat Monday. Thanks for such great recipes. Im always confident when I make a recipe from your site.

       Made these last night. Absolute yum. Unfortunately, had just made a Costco run and I had no freezer room. I can say a cooler with ice packs works fairly well. I probably should have cooked the caramel just a tad longer, as half of it stayed gooey.
       <br/>
       Deb, do you know what stage we are aiming for? Soft crack, I imagine, but it would be helpful to know. I didnt use a candy thermometer, but having made toffee before, it sounds as if a few folks now know how to make that, too. I love the intense chocolate flavor, with just the right amount of goo. Thank you!

       Made these on Sunday and they were good, but the carmel kind of just baked into the brownie. I rushed the caramel out of the freezer (maybe only let it set for 20 minutes) and it was still very soft and difficult to cut into pieces. I poured half of the brownie batter into the pan, then added globs of caramel in a layer and topped with the other half of the brownie batter and then added more caramel globs on top. It wasnt bad, but I think I prefer you regular perfect brownie recipe (SO GOOD ON ITS OWN) without the additional caramel.

       I made these on Sunday as well, and the caramel disappeared. Perhaps I didnt let it cook long enough. My caramel pieces turned out they way I thought they were supposed to, though, so Im not sure. Without the caramel, the brownies were quite bitter and not very cooked on the inside. O well.

       Perfect for valentines! except, in regards to the bf, a scull and crossbones cut instead of the heart. That would just be tooo much. Question, can I substitute brown sugar for the white? and would it be the same amount, or more or less.

       Made these over the weekend and yes  very delicious!  A lot of you seem to have comments about your experience with the caramel, so Ill add mine.  My caramel was rock solid out of the freezer.  Cutting it was impossible, I had to shatter it into pieces.  I didnt mix it into the batter, instead I scattered it around and pushed pieces underneath.  Out of the oven, the brownies looked not-so-nice.  The caramel had all melted into the brownies and left nothing but big holes where the pieces had been.  Really though, it doesnt matter much because these brownies are unanimously DELICIOUS.  If anyone would be so kind to post the ideal temperature for the caramel, Im sure it would be appreciated by all.  Id love to have my next batch look as good as it tastes!

       These look amazing!  I have tried to make salted caramel brownies with homemade caramel before and they turned into a eewey-gooey mush that my guests ate with spoons.  The spoonfuls were delicious, but the mess was less than attractive!  Cant wait to try these!

       Warning:  Novice question here.     Just to clarify,  to make the carmel,  one would just put dry sugar into the dry saucepan,  then add the butter later- as stated in the recipe?    In your picture it looks to me like you have mixed the dry sugar and butter together.  Thank you.

       Going to absolutely try these.  But I was wondering if the caramel here would do for caremel apples (which I like to do for V-day)?

       To answer some earlier questions about using half and half, I used it b/c thats all i had, and it worked fine.  My caramel was quite squishy, but it sounds like thats just how this recipe is  more of a firm caramel sauce.  I think you could even get  away with regular milk if necessary.  My go-to caramel recipe for holiday candies is ancient and calls for rich milk.  Ive used anything from all heavy cream to 2% with a big splash of half and half, with varied results on the firmness of the finished product, but my guess is that has less to do with the dairy and more with how long I let it cook (all of that soft ball/hard ball madness).  These were SO delicious.  ps: I also subbed in 72% bittersweet chocolate b/c thats all I had and used about 3/4 c sugar, maybe even 2/3 cup.  They were perfect!

       I made these brownies on Saturday night and they were awesome  probably the best brownies I ever made.
       <br/>
       I had the same caramel issue. The top of the brownie had holes and the caramel just melted into the brownie. I too wonder what the secret is to keeping the caramel is pockets like the finished product pictures.

       These elicted more sweet Jesus, oh my god, and other invocations of holy figures than anything Ive ever made before. I will make again and again. Like Jenny K above, the caramel on top melted into my brownies as well (not that it mattered as it tasted fantastic), which made me wonder if placing the caramel on top later in the baking process  enough to melt on top of the brownies but not into them  might work?

       I have a hard time judging the color of the caramel, and when to take it off the stovedo you have guidelines using a candy thermometer?  p.s. i just love your baking recipes  lots of them are my go-to recipes now!

       I made these yesterday and they came out fantastic! I doubled the recipe and made a larger batch in a 9X13 which worked out perfectly. The only thing I would change is adding a little less caramel. While they are ridiculously delicious, a lot of the caramel fell to the bottom which is yummy but made them a little touch on the bottom. Overall fantastic  I cracked sea salt over the top and it was the perfect taste. thanks!

       I did a test drive of this recipe last night. My plan is to bake them on Wednesday night, cut them into heart shapes, and bring them in for V-Day for the people who work in my office. Those aforementioned people  SOOOO lucky. These are ridiculously amazing and delicious. Two of my favorite foods are brownies and caramel, so to combine them is perfect. Thank you for the inspiration.

       I had no problem with the recipe  the caramel on top turned into puddles, just as it should have.

       Dainapen  I think the caramel for apples is cooked longer, so it firms up, but Ive never tried it so I cannot say for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julie  I do it in the order I say. In the first photo of the sugar, it is already beginning to melt and I rolled it around a little. Im always charmed by the thick wrinkly stage and take a photo.

       The caramels never seemed to harden completely, and as I tried to cut them with oiled knife, then finally just pinch them apart with oiled fingers, the ones Id already finished would quickly turn to puddles.  I was doing a double batch so Id put one plate back in the freezer while I worked on the other, and ended up doing each twice before stirring them in a quickly as I could, but I think the warm batter melted the first half straight in by the time I could wrangle the rest of the puddles into lumps to toss in.  Sigh.  At this point Ive licked so much sugar off my fingers I dont want to eat any.  Good thing Im giving half to friends leaving on a trip and going to a party with the other half tonight; everyone else can indulge, and if there are any left I know Ill enjoy one tomorrow!
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a next time, should I take this as a sign to cook the caramel longer before freezing it?

       This is extremely dangerous.  I made caramel with olive oil (ran out of butter!) and whole milk (didnt have cream!) and it was delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I put it in cupcakes because I didnt have brownie mix.  The result was to die for.  Absolutely idiotproof and scrumptious.

       New to you. Looking forward to trying a recipe or 2 or 3. I cook (for 5 months) in a smaller kitchen in our 5th Wheel RV, so I understand the confines of a small space. Most people dont understand that a smaller, well planned kitchen is actually easier to cook in.

       I made these as is! The brownies turned out exactly like how theyre supposed to  thin crackly top, deep chocolate flavour, squidgy pockets of creamy salty caramel. But everything was Insanely rich, even for me (a person who has no qualms with scoffing a good slice of real new york cheesecake or eating half a batch of cookies in one go). I would definitely halve the caramel the next time I make it, and/or cook the caramel longer to achieve a deeper, more rounded flavour.

       Oh my gosh, I have been wanting to make these since I saw a recipe in the Food Network magazine, but I have been thinking all along I would just use the leftover caramel ice cream topping that I have in the frig. Now I just cant do that! I have to make caramel! Thanks for the inspiration. Love the hearts!

       Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

       Made these. Incredibly decadent. Salty caramel is a knock-out (see: your salty apple tart). Caramel turned out somewhat brittle  couldnt cut it into pieces, but broke it easily into pieces with my fingers. The top part was less crater-like since the pieces of caramel were smaller. Inside the brownies, the caramel didnt get lost. Each and every bite was amazing. Am now making some for Valentines. And for family living far away. And as a thank you present for my neighbor. And

       Theyre in the oven now, but add me to the list of those for whom the caramel never hardened. After 1 1/2 hours in the freezer, I managed to scrape it off the parchment &amp; make little dollops in the batter. I still expect deliciousness!

       LOVED the Today Show segment and seeing your tiny kitchen. It really gave me a better perspective on the kitchen and a window into your world (you do have a beautiful big window in your kitchen!). I look forward to meeting you in St. Louis in early March! I am taking the brownies with me to book club tonight and I am sure everyone will love them (even if they dont look like the brownies in your pictures and the caramel melted into the brownies).

       So, I made these pretty much immediately after you posted them and I have a few questions. I didnt have bittersweet chocolate, I used 60% Ghiradelli as I *always* have the chips on hand for emergencies. Like making salted caramel brownies. OK, so anyways, I used the chips and the brownies werent overwhelmingly sweet, which was nice. But, maybe I didnt cook them long enough? The caramels sort of all glommed together at the bottom of the brownies, they didnt maintain their integrity at all. Yours look like they did? Im remaking them now and I froze the caramel a little more and will cook for the full 30 minutes. Oh, and I added more salt as I could not resist and the saltiness kind of got lost in the brownie. Also, my husband suggested using Rolos. I scoffed at him. Scoffed.

       SO delicious! I just made a batch to give to my boyfriend for V-Day and they turned out amazing! I didnt have any unsweetened chocolate in the house, so I used 60% cacao dark chocolate squares, which added a nice depth to the brownies :)

       THANK YOU! This was my first caramel adventure, and it turned out stupendously. Theyre a huge hit at work. My caramel also did not maintain its integrity in the brownies, but you can definitely taste pockets that have more caramel versus more chocolate, so it doesnt bother me too much.

       I, too, had the caramel sink into my brownies but had no problem with making the caramel and freezing and incorporating it into the batter. You could still taste the distinct caramel pockets even if you couldnt see them. On a side note, I had birthday money that was burning a hole in my pocket and I bought the Maldon Sea Salt. Yes, I spent gifted money on salt. Cant wait to try it. Pathetic, I know :)

       These inspired me to make brownies to send to the kid at college. I wanted them to be more stable/less messy, though, so I could ship them. Instead of making caramel, I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate caramel squares. Put in half the brownie batter, then the chocolates, then the rest of the batter. Im going to recommend she microwaves them for a few seconds before eating, for maximum gooeyness.
       <br/>
       Thanks for the inspiration!

       Made these last night, they were delicious! My only issue is that the carmel dint set too well, but I think that was mainly user error. I get so scared of burning it that I cheat the time! These will be a great contribution to the Valentines spread at my work- I got the heart cookie-cutter and everything!

       Made these last night and theyre a HUGE hit! Thanks for a great recipe. I think next time I might put the squares of caramel back in the freezer for a few minutes before stirring them in  I took too long to cut them and didnt get the little pockets of caramel in quite the same way you did.

       Ive never made a caramel from scratch before *hides in shame*.  I love that you posted multiple pictures makes me feel like its that much more doable.  The brownies look so tasty, I might just have to work up the courage to try.

       Made these last night and they were awesome! The brownie was that perfect cake/gooey combo. I really liked the addition of the caramel, but I would definitely recommend letting the caramel set all the way before adding it to the brownies. Also, I think I could have made them in a slightly larger pan, like a 99 because they are fairly dense and so it would have been good if they werent so tall and I could have cut bigger pieces.

       Please please please, Deb, tell us the temp for the caramel. Mine also became rock hard in the freezer, and left big sink-holes in the brownies. It would be much easier to do it again if we knew what temperature to cook the caramel. Thanks!

       Ive made these twice in 2 days. My friends in class loved the first batch, and Im hoping for the same when I take them to work tomorrow. I did have a hard time both times with the caramel staying hard and uniform as pictured. I cooked it longer the 2nd time around just in case I hadnt gotten the sugar to a hard enough stage the first time. I also left them in the freezer longer. Still got soft when I put them into the brownie mix. Oh well, still a really delightful treat, and it was fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did use half and half. Maybe that had something to do with it. I dont know. If I end up having heavy cream in my house next time, Ill use that to see if that makes a difference.

       Heres a tip- when you put the caramel in the freezer to chill, make sure your plate is on a level surface, or when you open your freezer 20 minutes later you will find caramel-covered everything. I should have known better than to try to balance the plate on a frozen chicken. Luckily I have enough heavy cream to try again!

       I made these and also had trouble with the caramel temperature. The first time I made the caramel, I cooked it for 3 minutes after returning it to the heat, and it was hard as a rock when it cooled. So I made it again with a candy thermometer, and brought it to just above the thread stage. It was still too hard, and ended up being like a very chewy candy throughout the brownies. But theyre edible especially if theyre warm! Would be interested in the right temperature just in case I try them again some day.

       This was the first time I tried to make brownies from scratch and it was so much easier than I expected! The only trouble I had was with getting the caramel to freeze, which it never did, after 2 hrs in the freezer. It made a huge mess when I was trying to cut it into pieces to put in the mix, because by the time I got to the end, I was scraping very soft caramel off the wax paper and sort of dolloping it on top of the batter in the pan. It didnt seem to affect the brownies though because everyone is raving about them!! They turned out fudgey and with just right amount of saltiness in the caramel. Your directions are so user-friendly and actually make sense, thank you!!!

       Liz  Sorry about the mess, but Im cracking up, imagining a photo pool where we all showed what our plates looked like in the freezer. Mine was smashed against the top, because the freezer is overstuffed with chaos (soups, tomato sauces, frozen things for Jacobs lunches, fruit for smoothies, and thats barely a quarter of it).
      </p>
      <p>
       kari  In the brownies, definitely. In the caramel, Im not positive. Ive never tried it, but hopefully if someone else has, they can weigh in.

       What an excellent recipe!
      </p>
      <p>
       The caramel had a wonderful flavor, however, I too had sticky caramel issues, even after throwing the pan outside on the snow, and in the freezer. Definately a cooking time issue-will cook the sugar and butter longer next time. In addition, adding the salt after the majority of the cooking would help too-dont need that boiling point elevation to increase cooking time even longer!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also spiked my batter with some bourbon, and added 1 TB of instant espresso powder-really countered the sweet, sticky and delicous caramel!
      </p>

       I made these, cut the pan into almost 64 pieces (well, I had to clean up those funny bits on the edge!) and brought them to work today  I am now everyones favorite person!  Absolutely delicious!  I did buy flake salt rather than skipping that for organic coarse grind  worth the $$ and now I have flake in my pantry.  Chewy, fabulous, dont eat more than two!

       So I wasnt sure what to make for a special Valentines Day dessert, I was stuck waffling between a couple choices when I thought, Ill just pop over to Smitten Kitchen for inspiration. Well, between your pictures and your description I was sold before I even got to the recipe. All I can say is, wow. You have never let me down! Thanks for another utterly fabulous recipe!

       Deb, my caramel took over an hour to cool and it was still oozydid it not cook long enough? I ended up putting them in the brownies (which they remained indistinguishable in appearance, but very pronounced in flavour) Besides not getting the novelty of gooey caramel they were insanely decadent and delicious.

       Never thought to put chunks of caramel in the brownies itself. Ive always been simply drizzling caramel sauce over the brownies. Gotta try this method next time!

       These were awesome! We made them for valentines for teachersthe best part was that the heart cut outs lef lots of leftovers  which I pretty much demolished I think that amounted to 4-5 real sized brownies but in small pieces much easier to eat more;)

       I also had a hard time with the caramel and made it three different times. The first two batches seemed like too much butter and in the end I used only 3 tbsp of butter and 2 of cream. It got very hard in the freezer so I basically chipped it apart for the batter. It didnt really matter as it got all mixed in and deliciously melty.
      </p>

       Thanks for this great Valentines Day treat!

       I am (almost literally) eating up your cookbook.  Thank you!  I have been reading your blog since I came upon your apple cake one day, and its nice to have your recipes and photos in a tangible form, sitting on my shelf!
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the caramel step, the texture seems on par, but after sampling the caramel (I HAD to test it!) it tasted a bit bitter.  Did I cook it too long?  My caramel color also seems darker than your photos.

       HOLY SHHHHHHHHHHEEESH! I have been trying your recipes for the past year (LOVE your garlic soup) but have never posted on your site. These brownies caused me to break my silence! I made them tonight for my sweetheart and seriously I had to convince myself not to eat the whole batch before I presented them to him (tough battle)!! They are absolutely  perfect. I will be making these for the rest of my life. THANK YOU!!!!!

       I Just dicovered your blog, spend hours reading and laughing and went straight into the kitchen to try these brownies. Had the same experience with the soft and sticky caramel but the taste was stunning. Baked them in a muffin pan thought and want to post your recipe in my (german) cook blog (of course I will link to your recipe). If you dont feel confortable with it please let me know. Also wish you a nice weekend. Eva

       I brought the leftovers (read:  my fiance would have eaten them all if I didnt get rid of them) to the faculty room at school.  There were fights over the last one.  Good thing the kindergarten didnt see that.

       Perfect v-day dessert (and, ah, morning after v-day breakfast *ahem*).  My mind is racing for ways to make these even more decadent (nuts! marsala-soaked cherries! coconut?), but honestly, they are perfect as-is.  Thank you!

       I also had issues with the caramel.  Medium-high heat had the sugar burning instead of melting.  The resulting batch of caramel was quite dark and tasted bitter.  Reducing the heat to medium-low produced a perfect second batch of caramel.  Unfortunately, my caramel pieces were too small to maintain any structural integrity in the finished product.  I ended up with caramel-flavored brownies, but they are absolutely delicious.  The fault was completely my own for not cutting the caramel into 1-inch pieces.  I cant wait to try again.  Thanks for the recipe, Deb!  You are simply amazing.

       Hi Deb.  Ive been reading your blog for years and always find you so informative.  So, I find it a little odd that you have not addressed the fact that so many people are having a hard time with the caramel.  The recipe would be much better and more able to be replicated by everyone if you gave a temperature to cook the caramel to.  I understand the desire to make it easier by not requiring a candy thermometer, but the quality of the recipe suffers for lack of it.

       I made these for my hubby and kids in college for V-day.  HUGE success!  I didnt have trouble with the caramel  probably because I have never made it before and didnt know that is was something that could go horribly wrong and therefore should be worried over.  Fortunately it turned out just right.  Sticky-gooey-yum!!!!!

       As a frightened first-time caramel maker, the caramel making instructions were very easy to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with some of the comments- these are closer to fudge than a brownie. Not that Im complaining; this is probably the most decadent thing Ive ever made!

       The brownies came out fantastically! My caramel never really set up in the freezer, so I couldnt cut it into neat 1 square. I ended up just tearing it into globs and dropping those in, which worked well enough.

       Im not the degree to which this is responsible, but I tossed the bits of caramel that were going into the batter with a little flour before mixing into the batter. I guess I was thinking that if it helps berries not sink to the bottom of my muffin, it would help the caramel stay afloat. I did get those lovely little pockets of caramel, so Im going to consider it a win!

       p.s. recipe doubled beautifully, making a nice, thick brownie in a 9x13x2 pan.

       I made these and they are excellent. There were some frozen vegetable casualties in my freezer when the carmel spilled a bit, but totally wortht. They seem to keep best in the fridge. Yum!!

       Someone asked about eating these with braces.  I have braces, and I think I ate about 4 of these brownies when I made them the other day.  I even ate one of the caramels alone, tho I really sort of sucked on it until it was gone.  This is not the sticky, cubed caramels that will ruin all your orthodontia, its totally doable.  Good thing too, or Id have had a huge new bill on my hands.

       My caramel seemed to fade away in the middle of the brownie and somewhat sink to the bottom, but the caramel on top spread out nicely and there are little pockets of gooey goodness on top.  I think this is probably because I have large square plates so the caramel may have been thinner than it should have been to hold up in the batter.  Either way there are as decadent as they sound and super easy w/ or w/out the caramel part  never making packaged brownies again!

       I made this exactly as written.  My carmel didnt harden, so i dropped the caramel globs into the batter  they disappeared.  I put some on top, and they cooked into the batter. So..they didnt look like your pictures, but the flavor was outstanding! Well be trying them again to see if they turn out more picture perfect.  But it took all our willpower not to eat the entire batch at one time!

       Amazing!  I have loads of yummy brownie recipies(I seem to collect them) but this recipe is the tops.  Dessert tonite was half the recipe.  Ive got to do my monthly weigh-in at Weight Watchers soon, but we have to eat these up before I eat right again.  Thats OK I would happily live on salad after eating these.

       My caramels came out nice and soft, chewy and stretchy  they looked very similar to your picture in size, thickness and overall appearance.  I was amazed.  But then they totally utterly melted into the brownies  even the ones sprinkled on top :(  The brownies are still delicious but sad about the melted caramels.

       They look gorgeous.  Now I wonder how much I can mess up the American measures if I try making them?  I can see much of the recipe has weight equivalents, but there are a bits that dont.  Maybe Ill give in and just try using cups (like any true brit it makes me VERY nervous if I dont get to weigh everything!!!)

       I made these and had the same caramel issues as everyone- tried again but made the caramel yesterday, froze for an hour then chopped and refroze. Today I made the brownie mix, but cooled it down prior to adding the flour and frozen caramel chunks,this was almost as good looking as above  and qualified as awesome, even by the same people who enjoyed the first lot! Hope this helps.

       Yum!  This looks awesome. I love your book and have made so many recipes from both.  Excited to try this one!  Is parchment paper a must?  Can I just use tinfoil or grease a pan for the freezer?

       I made these yesterday for a belated Valentines Day dinner (the mussels in vermouth and tarragon oven fries from the cookbook  yum!). Its a really good thing that some friends are coming over tomorrow, and that Ive promised them brownies so must not eat them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are insanely delicious  rich, fudgey, and the sweetness is perfectly offset by the salt. I almost never make brownies because even dark chocolate ones tend to be too sweet for me; the salt makes such a difference!
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that some of my chunks of caramel melted into the brownie while others didnt. I think I let my caramel spread too thin and I wasnt particularly careful about chopping up the caramel into equal-sized pieces; the smaller ones seem to be the ones that vanished, so Ill make sure I cut slightly bigger pieces next time.

       Ok, made these today with my three year old and they are spectacular.  I think I ended up halfway between a toffee and a caramel (it was hard and brittle coming out of the freezer, but ended up in beautiful melty pools just like Debs).  Im embarrassed to say that between me, my husband, my two little ones, and some friends who came by for a playdate, I think were going to polish these off in one day.  Between these and the maple bacon biscuits that are staple now in our home, I think I can blame at least 5 lbs on Smitten Kitchen.

       Hi there,
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried the recipe and followed everything as described, although I had to use chocolate chips instead of bakers chocolate because I was out of it. Unfortunately, my caramel pieces created huge craters in the brownie just like you described it as creating troughs. Would making the caramel colder help? Or changing something to the brownie recipe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hoping to make these for a potluck and would love it if the didnt look so bad. The taste though  amazing!

       @eliza  I made these using the best cocoa brownie recipe instead. I simply do not bother with other brownie recipes, so when I come across caramel/cheesecake/other brownie additions I want to eat, I always use the cocoa brownies as the base. That recipe is amazing (thanks, Deb!) and I have yet to find satisfaction with the fudginess in any other recipe that I so love in those/require in brownies. They came out great with the salted caramel!

       because we believe an 8 by 8 of brownies is never sufficient, I doubled the recipe into a 9 by 13 and it worked beautifully.  I did the carmel on a cookie sheet and silpat and it was fine.

       Like a few others I am getting the carmel sinking to the bottom  marks left on the surface but all of it ends up on the bottom.  This has happened both times I made them and I followed the recipie exactly both times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wondering if I should cook the carmel longer  resulting in a harder candy?  Cook for a shorter period of time?  Cook at a higher temp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time will try the suggestions I saw from a search of the comments  chill the batter and flour the carmels
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of where the carmel ends up these are really really good!

       Trouble with the caramel  Im so sorry some of you are having sinking/dissolving issues. I will make these again and note a correct temperature. My hunch is that it simply needs to be cooked a little longer so it gets a bit firmer in the fridge, closer to making a classic caramel candy. Also, as I noted in an earlier comment (and tried to in the recipe), the caramel doesnt get
       <i>
        hard
       </i>
       in the freezer, just firm enough that it can be cut into bits when its very cold. (At room temperature, it quickly becomes more sauce-like, because I wanted to emulate the caramel sauce effect in the brownies.) Nevertheless, a temperature reading would help everyone and I will add it soon. My husband will NOT be sad that I have to make these again, not one bit. ;)

       Jasmine  I agree, this is a slower-than-average response rate from me. I wish I could get to it faster, but its been a very busy week-plus (a few days in Canada, a sick kid, etc. etc.) around here, and it just wasnt possible. I dont employ recipe testers or an assistant, so when I become crazy busy for a week, theres always a lapse on the site. I wish that it werent the case, Id rather always have time to be here, but I also wouldnt be comfortable with anyone else doing my cooking or comment-responding for me. In the next couple days, this should be updated with a temperature reading.

       Hi Deb,
       <br/>
       I think I have found a partial solution to the melting caramel problem. Instead of using a lge plate to cool the caramel on (which I did the first time), I used a smaller one thereby allowing a thicker caramel. In no way did the caramel get hard enough in even 40 mins., so I left it in the freezer for several hours. Once all cut to size I refroze for 30 mins. and then tossed all but a few into the brownie mixture, quickly adding the loose ones on top and into the oven it went. Not all the pieces remained intact within the brownie, but not all melted like my first attempt. I am thinking the trick is the thickness of the caramel pieces as well as adding them to the cooled brownie mixture. In any case, they are so,so,so scrumtious that it really doesnt matter if the caramel melts in the brownie or in my mouth!

       Add me to the ranks of those-who-made-brownies-with-sunken-caramels. The taste is outstanding and Im not sorry I made them, only sorry that they dont look as pretty as Debs! I did cool the dough before adding the cut caramels and also left the caramels in the freezer for over an hour to no avail  a cratered top and disappeared caramels BUT oh the taste its heavenly.

       Amazing! I had the same issue with the caramel disappearing into the batter. Know what? I served it at two different events and everyone said they were amazing. No one noticed the disappearing caramel, just loved the awesomeness that is the perfect brownie.

       Stop. Stop right now. This is NOT ALLOWED, do you know how hard it is to follow a plant based, vegan diet when I see things like this? I lose ALL self control when it comes to chocolate and caramel. Or brownies and caramel. Or dark chocolate brownies and caramel. Oh dear..

       I made these yesterday.  They are WONDERFUL!  The caramel stays gooey and the brownies themselves are very moist.  Having made it once, it will go quicker next time.  I will be making these again for sure!  Thanks!

       I made these twice on the weekend for friends and they are definitely easier than they appear to guests ;) I lost all my caramel the first time too, and after reading comments and finding others had the same issue, tried a couple things. Im pretty sure I cooked my caramel correctly but Im not sure i set it long enough. The second time I also let it set again after I cut it since yor hands melt the caramel slightly. I put the thickest pieces in and the batter had cooled slightly when I did (although it was a pain to put in the pan ). Then I tried a few bits on top (and held some back) but they melted in the first 5 minutes. So I put the few I kept on top in the last 3 or so minutes and they melted perfectly. Inside the caramel melted but you could tell where, not like my first batch that seemed to just all blend together. Regardless these are amazing and Im determined to keep making them until I get it right!

       I made these for our belated Valentines Day celebration on Friday and they are divine.  Happily, I had no caramel-related issuesI made it just as directed and, since I was out of parchment paper, used a Silpat over a plate which worked beautifully.  About 20 mins in the freezer and I was able to cut it upmine ended up being less than perfect 1 inch squares (more shattering), but no matter.  For the same reason (no parchment paper), I used a non-stick 9 round cake pan (buttered and floured) for baking and had no sticking issues at all.  I also upped the salt quantity a bit b/c I like really salty caramel.  I have been keeping my brownies in the fridge, as you suggested, and they are wonderful even coldthe caramel is chewy, not hard (as you noted).  So, so good and I thought these came together remarkably quicklyyou get can get the brownie batter done while your caramel cools and thats that!

       What an amazing recipe!! I made these the same day I saw the recipe, and brought them to work the next day for Valentines Day. Everybody LOVED them! Ive never made caramel before and it was easier then Id ever imagined. I bake a LOT and this recipe is staying on my favorites list. I followed it exactly. Wellmaybe a few extra sprinkles of salt because I love salted caramel  But overall, it was super easy and super tasty. Thanks for sharing another great recipe. You ROCK!!!!!

       I made these for my husbands birthday last week, and we are slowly eeking them out. I think were down to our last portions. These were a huge hit! I cannot get enough of the caramel islands. I think next time Ill add some expresso powder to increase the bitterness and cut down a little on the sugar, as they are just a mite too sweet for me. Thank you, Deb!

       These got rave reviews from all! I used Debs best cocoa brownies recipe (minus 1/4 cup sugar) for the brownie base and they were dense, fudgy and amazing. It was my first time making homemade caramel, but I dont think it will be the last!

       So I am currently made two batches at the same time, but one at a time.The first one looked perfect before it went into the oven. I set my oven to 350, let it pre-heat, then put them in for 30 mins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, after the 30 mins, I tried to get a clean toothpick. Nope, so I set the timer for another three mins and checked it afterwards. Still not a clean tooth pick. I did this I would say at least a dozen times or more. Finally, I was worried that I was burning them by letting them stay in so much longer, but my tooth pick never came away clean. I finally had to take them out, and I had burned them around the edges.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first one is currently in the freezer and I will see if I can salvage it, but the caramel pieces on top obviously melted into the brownies since they were in so much longer.Not sure if the ones inside completely melted away or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my second batch in the oven now and I am only going to keep them in for ten mins total longer, whether a get a clean tooth pick or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I am the only one who has had this specific issue *sigh*

       I just whipped up a batch and could not be happier with the results. Exactly what I was looking for ,and more ,in a brownie. I put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes, to ease the crumbling while cutting issue, and they are just sublime!!!!! A total keep, keep, keeper!!!!! Thank you Deb!

       These look incredible, this is one of my favourite combinations of flavours and I have been so disappointed with other recipes suggesting shop-bought caramels (I refuse!) so thank you so much for suggesting a way to make them that works in this recipe.  I will definitely be trying these very soon indeed (well, maybe I should make them post-wedding  I am trying to exercise some form of self-restraint at the moment, however unsuccessfully!).  I would also like to say that I am very very excited about your cookbook being released in the UK at the end of this month, and thank you for anglicising it for us!

       I made these brownies and they were incredible. My only concern while baking was that the caramel didnt fully set and I put it in my chest freezer for an hour and a half. I scooped the half set caramel into the brownie mixture and it was still amazing. Is there a trick for making the caramel set? Did it need to be cooked longer?

       Holy mackerel these were amazing!! I am a super chocoholic and have tried a million brownie recipes but these were above and beyond. I nearly died every time I helped myself to another square (much to my husbands amusement). I used Trader Joes Pound Plus Dark Choc bar (a generous 3 ounces) and the mix of dark chocolate with the salty caramel was exquisite. I cant recommend highly enough!! Thanks Deb!

       I recently discovered this blog &amp; am totally hooked! I made these brownies for my boyfriend and me last night.  As soon as I saw them the other day I could not take my mind off of them and even though I try to bake more waist friendly desserts I decided to give in &amp; indulge a bit with these! While the brownies were absolutely delicious, my caramel did not keep its form quite the way yours did so they are not as picture perfect.  I used light cream though instead of heavy cream, maybe that is why?  I also made shakshuka (one of my favorite things to make!) last night and used a combination of your recipe &amp; 2 other Israeli cookbooks- I added eggplant &amp; sprinkled goat cheese. AMAZING!

       Ive made these twice and both times something went wrong (not that prevented us from eating all of them but). Both times, there was so much air in them that they bubbled up and looked like (my husbands words) brains. They had more of a souffle like texture. Any idea what I did wrong?!

       I just wanted to say I love your recipes, pictures, and blog. I first came to your site when I found your pink lady cake, and have made a few of your creations. I made these brownies the day after your post. They were the BEST brownies I have ever put in my mouth. They also got rave reviews at work. I have never tried my hand at homemade caramel. Your instructions made it a breeze. I love the bite that the sea salt gave and will definitely be making these again. I have every intention of purchasing your book, but will cross my fingers I get it from my hubbs for my birthday. Please, keep making delectable easy to follow recipes and taking beautiful photos.
       <br/>
       ps. I LOVE the name Smitten Kitchen.

       Hi! I just wanted to say that I absolutely LOVE your blog. First place I come to for good recipes. Second, I made these brownies this past weekend and they turned out phenomenal, literally gone in less then 30 minutes good. I just wanted to give you a small tip to making the caramel. A dry caramel cooks more evenly and faster if you melt the sugar a little at a time, should start off even by heating your pot on the stove with nothing in it to help even more, then start off by melting one tablespoon until its nice and amber then add a little more  until its all melted. You get no lumps of sugar in half the time!

       After making 4 batches of the carmel, I noticed a couple of things: #1-med-high heat on my electric stove is way too hot (sooo- I notched it down to between medium- medium low)  It also depended on what pot size I used and, which burner (large or small).
       <br/>
       #2  I was forever having sugar crystals  some harder than othersand, some refusing to melt. (sooo  I began by adding a small bit of water to the sugar  making it desolve  (the water burns off as it boils) and, the sugar bubbles to a great caramel color.  As well, I learnt to not stir the sugar once it began to bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great results!

       These look amazing. I like to add other flavors to my caramel too like ginger or cinnamon. Of course salted caramel is so mouth watering. I cant wait to try these.

       Ok, so I too was craving a temp on the caramel. Friend made them, said they were awesome but that the caramel sort of incorporated when baked. This reminded me of Lebowitz dulce de leche brownies for me- tasty but not like the photos.
       <br/>
       I tried these anyway.
       <br/>
       Wasnt sure about the caramel. Barely firmed. Unable to cut.
       <br/>
       In the process of waiting to add it, the brownie mix without the flour cooled substantially. Finally added the flour and with a sticky mess and knife and fingers scraped up globs of caramel and plopped them into the batter already in the pan- could not see mixing this mess in the bowl!
       <br/>
       They came out exactly as your photo. Firm to cut from freezer. Then oozing onto plate as they came to temp. Sarah(ironically) at post #470 similarly cooled the batter and had good results. I checked the comments after i made them to double check if i had missed any tips, so I might think about cooling the batter!
       <br/>
       Thanks- very yum!!!

       I made these on Friday for a girls nightwhat a hit! Everyone loved them, including a couple of girls who almost never eat desserts.  This is the third brownie recipe Ive made from the smitten kitchen, and I know that Ill be memorizing this one too!
      </p>
      <p>
       I found the caramel to be surprisingly easy to make; Im definitely going to try your other caramel recipes!  (I burned the first batch, but thats because I was trying to make sure it was cooked enough as per some comments. The second caramel batch I made, I cooked it about 3.5 minutes after adding butter and etc. and it turned out beautifully).
      </p>
      <p>
       Addressing the difficulties some people had with the caramel melting in their brownies: I cut my caramel into about 3/4 inch square chunks. That worked out really well. I set the small edge bits aside to be eaten alone, and those went quickly too!
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I didnt have unsweetened chocolate, I made the brownies with 64 % cacao and reduced the sugar to around 160g (roughly 3/4 C) like in some of your other brownie recipes, and that worked very well.

       I saw this recipe and literally thought about it for two weeks until I caved in and made it. The photos are food porn! The first time I burned the caramel because the heat was too high. I immediately tried again and got it right. This is by far the easiest, tastiest, brownie recipe Ive ever made. Thank you for sharing. You taught me how to make salted caramel and for that I am eternally grateful.

       I prefer to make a caramel with water because its more forgiving, so I started with the 1/2 cup of sugar and added a 1/4 cup of water. Melt the sugar like normal (the water will boil off, takes a little while), and wait until its caramel colored. Stir in butter, salt and cream (its bubble up a lot, be careful), and then return to heat. Bring back to a boil and cook until a candy thermometer reads 234-235 degrees. This is right on the edge of soft ball and hard ball, an produces a nice gooey caramel that still somewhat holds its shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR; Cook the caramel to 234-235 degrees and you should have no problems.

       I followed this recipe and got crunchy toffee instead of chewy caramel. Any ideas where I might have gone wrong?  Did I forget a spoonful of cream?  Cooked too long?

       Just an update. I ended up breaking the brittle caramel up and mixing it in the brownies just to see how itd turn out. During the bake, it re-melted the sugar and seems that I drew in some of the moisture from the batter. The final product is kind of like a soft sticky toffee embedded in brownies, with a little bit of brittle crunch here and there. Its actually a happy accident.

       I am at my wits endI have tried to make this three times and cannot keep the caramel from solidifying when I add the butter and sugar.  My most successful effort (which still had lots of chunks) was when, after reading tons of other caramel recipes online, I tried to stir the sugar as little as possible when melting, and also warmed the cream and butter before adding it.  But againI still had lots of chunks that I had to strain out and didnt have enough caramel as a result.  What else could I possibly be doing wrong??

       Made these last week, and although they didnt look just like yours as the caramel on top had sunken in, and I didnt have defined caramel globs inside they were still delicious. I suspect it was a combination of having them too close to the top of the oven, and in my impatience (actually greed) the caramels were still a bit gooey when I put them into the batter, even though theyd been in the freezer for ages.

       A quick note to those having trouble with the caramel
      </p>
      <p>
       Try melting the sugar at a lower temperature. This will yield a more golden colour as the sugar doesnt burn when melting it at higher temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also observed that doing it this way also allows it to freeze more in a more firmly, making it easier to chop.
      </p>
      <p>
       On previous attempts at this, I melted the sugar on a higher temperature. The caramel was darker, and would melt almost as soon as I opened the freezer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this helps!

       I made these this weekend for St. Patricks Day.  I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed it to the letter and they turned out decadently delish!  I used a shamrock cookie cutter and served them warm with ice cream.  Great tip to freeze them for a bit.  It made it much easier and cleaner when cutting shapes. Everyone gobbled them up.thanks!

       tara  Theres no harm in the caramel re-solidifying. It will always melt again, given enough heat and time. You can break up any bits and stir a lot to hasten this along.

       Ok, caramel to 237F, take off heat, topped out at 240F. Thanks Laura.
       <br/>
       Would hold back some butter next time, heat to 240f then stop it with the butter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I poured the batter into the pan, then plopped the caramel on top and pushed some in deeper than others resulting in every piece having fab oozy caramel
      </p>
      <p>
       Came out perfectly- somewhere between oozy and holding onto the brownie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was a big hit, of course. thanks Deb.

       Help! I have now made these brownies three times (no apologies). BUT I can never get the caramel to harden. At first I thought it was my freezer, but I have just moved and made them again and after nearly 3 hours in my new freezer the caramel was still soft. What am I doing wrong? I use whatever cream I have in the fridge (either 18 or 35% mf) and that doesnt seem to make a difference. Am I not getting the caramel to a high enough temperature? Any ideas would be most appreciated Thanks!

       Please, for the people that tried this recipe : Once the brownies cool off completely or the day after they were made, does the caramel get hard again in the brownies?  Or do we have to microwave them everytime to get the gooey texture back?

       I have tried for years and years to successfully make caramel, and felt incredibly accomplished recently when I finally mastered the salted butter caramel sauce you posted back in 2008(

       </a>
       ). I made it to go along with some deliciously rich red wine chocolate souffles and the the next day, microwaved (dont be horrified until you try it), it was the gooiest, most delicious hot-fudge-caramel-brownie-dessert Ive ever tasted (

       I made these for my office, and they were a major hit!  I think next time I make them, I will take your advice and make the caramel very solid.  It was still pretty soft when I folded it into the batter, and I had the problem that a lot of people are having where the caramel just sinks to the bottom and doesnt create delicious pockets of melty goodness.

       These were of course, amazing. I was a bit too impatient and didnt let the caramel set for long enough so it kind of sunk to the bottom. Making them again though just so I can rectify this mistake :)

       I made these and they were amazing, amazing, amazing!!!! Added 2 Tbsp of cocoa to make them a richer, and more salt to the caramel which I recommend doing. But these are by far the BEST brownies I have ever made. Oh Deb

       A solution for all of you who have been experiencing sinking caramel:
       <br/>
       I have made these brownies 4 times now. The first time I didnt let my caramel harden enough and it was a sticky mess to work with. The second time I let it harden longer and then chopped it up and folded it in. I found that the chunks stuck together in the batter and formed a few large pockets of caramel. The third and forth times I tried a different approach. I used a circular baking dish: line it with the parchment paper and pour the caramel in. Put the circular tin and a plate the same diameter into the freezer, and freeze it until the caramel is hard. Peel caramel off parchment paper and put back in the freezer on the plate. Re-line the circular tin with the same paper and spread half the brownie batter on the bottom. Take the caramel off the plate from the freezer and put on top of bottom brownie layer. Spread the rest of the batter on top, and, voila, caramel pocket across the entire brownie that doesnt sink. By far the best sandwich Ive ever had!

       Kids wanted a quick Saturday night treat.  Not wanting to take the time to make my own caramel I did the next best thing and used the Costco caramels.  They are the best store bought caramels.  We couldnt help eating a few straight from the wrapper.  Easy to unwrap and cut in half, created the perfect caramel pockets.  Best caramel brownies ever.

       My friend tried these and had the sinking/dissolving caramel issue (still very tasty brownies), but she also had a fair bit of spare caramel  more than she could demolish  which wound up in my freezer.  I decided to use it in place of the chocolate hazelnut filling in some babkas* (

       </a>
       ), with some fresh macadamias, and the result was excellent.  The salted caramel stayed a defined swirl in the centre, probably because of the more fibrous nature of a yeast dough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just in case anyone else is left with more salted caramel than they can really eat on its own, even though it is so delicious.

       *Any non-Aussies using this, go by the weights, our cups are a different size to most other countries I think.  Having said that, its a fairly forgiving recipe  I accidentally doubled the butter (who actually reads the method?), and just wound up with flakier-than-intended loaves.  Not really such a terrible thing =)

       Hi. my name is tessa. my best firend is kim and we have a baking blog to. we are 10 and live in amsterdam. our blog is in dutch so you may not be able to read it. my mom is from america and rites the recpt at the bottom so my grandmother can see what we make.
       <br/>
       i like your blog and we want to make this recept. what is unsweetened chocolate? Is that like pure chocolate? the dark kind? I thik all our chocolate is sweet. Can we still make the carmel brownies?
       <br/>
       sorry if my spelling is wrong. I dont rite in english much and my mom is making me do this myself.
       <br/>
       Thank you for helping.

       Hi Tessa  If you cannot find unsweetened chocolate (it looks like regular chocolate but has no sugar in it  its no fun to eat at all), try using the least sweet/most bitter chocolate you can find and dialing back the sugar by a spoonful or two. Enjoy!

       Hi Deb
       <br/>
       I made these and have the same problem with them sinking to the bottom, making them difficult to take off paper.. They tasted amazing but I would really love them to have the pockets of caramel. My caramel was just as you advised..should I let batter cool or coat caramel in flour. Dont know what I did wrong but really want to make these for a family occasion.
       <br/>
       recently got your book and its so lovely !

       Cassidy  Bittersweet is less sweet, but this recipe calls for unsweetened (or 99% chocolate), if you can find it.

       These are now a staple in our house and are the go to hostess gift I take to dinners, teas, brunches, everywhere.  I have never had a problem with the caramel and sometimes I even make it a day ahead of time, wrap it up and FREEZE it overnight to add to the batter I make the next day.  I just take the caramel out of the freezer and hit it (on a cutting board) with the side of a meat tenderizer until it is the size chunks I like.  Always a hit (no pun intended)!!!  Thank you!, thank you!

       Made these for a second time last night, and I just have to say that Im in love. These are the best brownies Ive ever had, and I *love* brownies. Theyre always so moist and gooey! The first time I made them, I took them to my roller derby leagues end of the season picnic they were gone within 10 min.

       Tip for caramel that wont harden: Transfer the caramel and parchment paper onto a plate and into the microwave.  Microwave on high in 20 second increments until it begins bubbling and turns a shade darker.  Then transfer the caramel back into the freezer to set.  This worked like a charm.

       Hello! I made these yesterday and they were delicious! I had a problem with the caramel not getting firm enough. I left it in the freezer for two hours and it was still really gooey and baked into the brownie batter. Though the bits on top stayed separated. Any suggestions? Maybe I didnt cook the caramel long enough? I did not have heavy cream and used half &amp; half instead, could that have been it? SO GOOD!

       I couldnt wait for the perfect temp for the caramels  just made these again (3x now)    the caramel took 2.5 hours at flash-freeze to get semi-hard, i.e. hard enough to make little balls of it;  it never got hard enough to cut into cubes    I waited til the brownies had been in the oven 15 minutes before putting the last 1/3 of the caramel balls/bits on the top   Then cooled and froze the finished brownies  (an hour in the freezer once they were completely cooled) .. cut into perfect little hearts lots of little squares and a whole batch of scraps that were planning on mixing into the chocolate truffle ice cream were making this weekend.   The brownies are amazing  and this time the caramel puddled enough that they look and taste gorgeous!

       I made these this morning to send to my daughter who is away at camp.  I made the caramel last night and in 30 minutes in the freezer it was hard enough to cut.  I cut into squares and left in the fridge overnight on a silpat so they wouldnt stick to anything.  Made the brownie batter this morning and added the caramel.  They wanted to stick together in the warm batter, but I separated them with a spoon and popped the pan in the oven.  Yum!  The caramel is even good enough to eat by itself.  I sprinkled the top with salt instead of incorporating it into the caramel and they are delicious!

       These are seriously the BEST brownies I have made. Ever. And I have searched forever for a great, foolproof recipe. I have made these three times in the last month for different people and each time, I am begged for the recipe and have my praises sung. I refer them to your recipe and tell them to praise and be thankful for you and this amazing recipe :)

       <br/>
       because they didnt even last the night. The first time I made them
       <br/>
       Though I overcooked the caramel. Do you have a temp you bring the caramel too? Its hard to go by color.

       I have made these a dozen times and decided my vegan friend needed to try them (favorite brownies!). So I replaced the butter in the caramel with earth balance, the cream with coconut cream, the eggs with flax eggs, and the butter in the brownies with coconut oil. The caramel seemed fine, but when I put it all together and into the oven- 30 min later it was a bubbling mess. The caramel or coconut oil separated from the brownie and it just did not work. I tried baking it a little longer and then cooling, but still just awful (layer of liquid on top and brownies below chewy and not delicious). If anyone has made these vegan, I would love to hear how they did it!!

       Hello
       <br/>
       I made these brownies last week but had a problem with the caramel.
       <br/>
       I followed the recipe and put it in the freezer, but after more than an hour, it did not solidify, nor it was liquid, but somewhere in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ended up adding it to the brownies as it was, and stirring it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any tip why it did not solidify?

       I made these brownies this weekend, and they were delicious!  Like several other commenters, though, my experience with the caramel is that is was brittle when I took it out of the freezer, and shattered and cracked when I tried to cut it.  While the end results were still pleasing, Im curious about this development.  Id never made caramel before; did I cook it on the stovetop too long?  Or did I freeze it too long?  If like to make these again, but Im not sure what to do to change the results: I though Id followed the recipe exactly.

       Heather  Just froze it too long. If you could take it out of the freezer a few minutes sooner next time, youll be able to choose what size pieces you cut it into. But, once its baked, it wont make any difference how cold the caramel got.

       I made these last night.this morning after being in the fridge all night are even better! I like a real salty sweet combo so I put sea salt on top, man is this good! The only thing for me was, I think while putting my toothpick into the brownies I was hitting caramel so I didnt think they were done! I might have baked them 10-15 too long but I am not sure!! Because they were still so good and not hard or anything so I think I might have cooked them just right?! So instead of 30 minutes I had them in 40-45 minutes. But these will be made again! Im 21 and starting my baking hobby heavily and I thank you for this recipe!

       Perfect! The most decadent treat I have had in a while. Made them for my husbands birthday. I live in Israel where salted caramel is still unknown (no SC icecream, vodka, etc)so it has been really fun to introduce these to friends!

       These were the hit of the Super Bowl party I went to yesterday! I had tried making the caramel with sugar-in-the-raw, which was a bad idea. It melted and burned very quickly. My second attempt with granulated sugar was successful. I think my caramel chunks were little small and may have disappeared in the brownies a bit, but they were so delicious, it didnt matter.

       Hi Deb! I made these last week and loved them. I want to make them for a gluten-intolerant friend  given theres only 85g of flour in these, could I just leave it out, or do I need to substitute with a different type of flour? Hope you can help!

       Laura  Yes, that would be fine. You could also just butter the plate. But a thin lining makes it easier to slide the whole thing off to chop it up.

       These are amazing! The caramel is perfectly gooey (which is to say a little) and the brownie is quite good for being chocolate based (my holy grail is Debs Best Cocoa Brownies. I find most brownie recipes to just be ok in terms of chocolate flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If youre thinking about making these, do, theyre easy and taste divine! These freeze beautifully (as do the best cocoa brownies) and are good straight out of the freezer or slightly thawed as it firms up the texture. Room temp they have a great texture as well. Make em!

       First: Delicious! Just as good as I imagined them to be. But,
       <br/>
       Second: What am I doing wrong with caramel-making? It took WAY more than 5 minutes for the sugar to liquidize. It hung out instead in this crumbly weird stage for a long time, until I jacked the heat way past medium-high. And then, it was grainy. Inside the brownies, of course, all sins are forgiven, but I wish I could get the hang of caramels. THey are simplicity itself in terms of ingredients, but I am apparently executing them horribly wrong.
       <br/>
       Finally: Thanks! for the great recipe.

       Hi,
       <br/>
       Id like to thank you very much for this recipe which I made yesterday with my mum: we both loved these adorable and super tasty brownies! If I may, Id suggest to make salted caramel more than 2 hours before the cake: this probably means my freezer is even more terrible than yours! :D

       Clearly, Im the only person with this issue, but I dont see how you melt the sugar for caramel.   Ive read through everything twice and I dont see water in the recipe.  I ruined about two batches thinking that butter replaced it for the syrup. Thanks!

       i wanted these to work so badly! it took me 3 attempts to get the caramel right (1st one burnt, 2nd one seized up, 3rd was good but i think i slightly undercooked?). since my caramel was so soft (even after an hour and a half in freezer), it melted into the brownies like others have said. i even waited until 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time to put the pieces on top, and they pretty much melted in too. the end result is TASTY, but not what i was hoping for. my brownies also turned out a little greasy. i realize they are moist and gooey and i love all that, but they are downright greasy on the bottom. maybe butter in the pan next time instead of spray oil?

       These are insane. I made them exactly as written and then proceeded to make them 4 more times in the past month. I even won a baking competition with them! (Fear not Deb got all the credit.) I cut the sugar in the brownies a bit and actually preferred them that way. Also had success doubling the recipe in a 913 pan. I cant recommend them highly enough! And they make a killer grown up brownie sundae with vanilla gelato!

       So I tried making these today, and they were pretty amazing.  I cant believe I actually made caramel  Ive never done that before  and the brownies themselves and absolutely incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only slight problem is that the caramel still seems a bit hard even in the baked brownies, at least in spots, which makes me wonder if I messed up making it it did seem a bit clumpier than your pictures.  Any thoughts on what I can do better next time?  Because the flavors are just too perfect for words.

       Hi Deb,
      </p>
      <p>
       Made these insane brownies for Game Night at a friends place. I usually print out the recipes because I make my own notes keep it on the side while baking. The  recipe was wildly passed around and someone even took it home to make them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just had one big problem. The parchment was a big fail. Everything stuck to it. By that I mean the caramel and the cake. I did not butter the parchment for the caramel  silly me. The texture was perfect unlike what some people say about it being too hard. Mine was chewy and incredible. I buttered the parchment generously for the cake but the cake stuck to it miserably. Did I do something wrong by allowing the cake to cool inside the pan in the fridge before unmoulding it? Does the heat help the cake slide off easier? Needless to say we were all in the kitchen picking bits off the paper and licking our fingers madly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again for such a genius recipe. Would like to try it again without the messy parchment problem. I also prefer buttering and dusting my pans with flour  old school I know, but foolproof! Can I try that method instead of the parchment?
      </p>

       Safrina  Im sorry you had trouble with the recipe. What kind of parchment did you use? I have found that some brands are kind of terrible and this might be more of a parchment failing if it stuck. I usually use one that comes in a brown box with the very passive-aggressive name If You Care and its very good.

       May I suggest using a walled container for freezing the caramel? As an occasionally accident-prone individual, I easily managed to spill a fair amount of caramel all over the contents of the freezer whoops

       Hi I made these twice, the first time the caramel went the second time I cooked the caramel (after the cream has been added) to firm ball 250 F on the candy thermometer. I then refroze the caramel after I cut it. Some of it survived and was wonderful and liquidy, some of it melted away to a cavity so maybe keep the chunks large? I actually added the caramel to the spiced brownie recipe and its really good!

       I love the sound of this recipe, but I do like the more traditional method with the carmel covering the top of the brownie.  Any recommendations on how I might do that with this recipe?? thanks!

       Ive made this recipe 3 times and theres something really wrong with the brownie portion. Though the toothpick comes out completely clean, these brownies always turn out as heavy, gluey sludge. Delicious heavy, gluey sludge, but even for a fudgey brownie these come out looking underdone.

       Im sorry it hasnt been working out. As the base recipe is the same as my
       <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/08/my-favorite-brownies/" rel="nofollow">
        go-to brownie
       </a>
       , which isnt exceedingly (just the right amount, or so I like to think) fudgy, I think this has more to do with the caramel melting into the brownies, making them heavier and stickier. Its a really over-the-top recipe. Does baking them longer help?

       Really frustrating to plow through 631 posts to try to find out whether its alright to double the recipe and bake in an 816    Guess Ill try it and see what happens.  Must be a better way .

       Esmee  You can double the recipe. I have never seen an 816 before, but I double them in a 913 often. Theyre just a tiny bit thicker.

       This is a family favourite, I have made them at least a dozen times and everyone raves every time! However, the first 3 times the caramel turned out perfectly, easy to cut and keep separate in the brownie batter.  The following 9-10 times however, it just didnt solidify  left it in the freezer for a full hour, but it is still a gooey mess!  The end result is still yummy, but I would love to have the perfect caramel again! Any idea what I might be doing wrong? I have tried cooking the sugar longer, cooking it longer once its all mixed together, measuring everything 3X to make sure its correct, etc. . . help!

       Do you think this same caramel method (freezing the caramel and then placing it on top of the dough to cook) would also work with cookies (your intensely chocolate sables, for example)?

       Hm I feel like it could work with a chocolate chip or other thicker drop cookie (although, it would be gooey and messy, but thats perhaps the point) however I dont think Id use it for the sables, where the goal is that they should be thin and crisp.

       i looked through the comments but couldnt see someone who had made them, so i went ahead and did it.
       <br/>
       they taste beautiful, but i did have a bit of trouble, when youre mixing the melted sugar with the butter it clumped immediately, and did not dissolve till i put it back on the stove, the caramel melted quite fast, making it difficult to put the little squares into the batter, and on top of it. and the salted taste is not very prominent.
       <br/>
       other than those minor difficulties which probably were just because Im not experienced, it was surprisingly easy, and completely delicious, Im taking them on my youth summer camp and the teenagers will go crazy for them :)

       Hi! Ive made this a few times and the brownie batter always absorbs the caramels on top, any way to prevent this? I want the caramels to stay intact and gooey.

       so when you use the heart shaped cutter  what do you do with the leftover non heart part?  is this a dumb question?

       We have a potluck at the office today so I made these last night (breaking the cardinal rule of not trying something new last minute). Ive had terrible results trying to make caramel from scratch before but I was feeling daring. I doubled the recipe since it was for more people and several commenters here said that wasnt a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I decided to make the caramel several hours in advance. I burnt my first batch of sugar before I even got to the caramel stage (I was trying to go by time and walked away from the cooking sugar) and then panicked and poured the burnt sugar in the sink so I spent half an hour trying to chip/rinse that out. The second batch I stood and stirred religiously but it went brown super fast anyway (and I was using a good Calphalon pot too). I took it off the heat and added the rest of the ingredients but never put it back on the heat because I was afraid it would get too dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       At around 10:30 I settled in to make the rest. (One doesnt bake brownies with an awake 6yr old in the house unless one plans to share.) The brownie recipe was a no brainer  not a single problem making that so I went to the freezer to retrieve my caramel. It looked great and thanks to a liberal spray of PAM, came right off the parchment. But it was melty! I could barely cut it, it oozed back together and I wound up stretching strands like melted mozzarella cheese to get my squares apart. Im guessing that was due to the omission of the second cooking. I was really afraid it would dissolve in my brownies but I was at the point of no return so I went for it. I covered the entire inside of my 911 with buttered parchment paper since I was going to be cutting these up to serve anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       The brownies needed to cook longer than the recipe said  at 30mins they were still wet. Probably due to the doubling so I kept a close eye on them and took them out closer to 40mins in. They looked perfect! I sprinkled some malden sea salt flakes on top and left them to cool overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       This morning, with great trepidation, I took them out of the pan and cut them into boring squares (ok so Im geometrically challenged, they were more like rhombuses when I was done cutting) I cut away the edges to try to even them out (Ok, really so that I could try them.) They are AWESOME! Gooey with caramel, chocolaty but not painfully sweet  I LOVE them, THANK YOU!!! Next time I would probably make a little more caramel and make sure to get a full layer on the top because it looks really cool on there but otherwise, this is a total keeper Great work!!!!

       I love most of Debs recipes, but I wont make this again. I had a hankering for a half size brownie of the turtle variety, so I made these. I did sub fancy caramels from Christmas for the homemade ones. They were high quality but pretty hard, and they baked up just right  strongly chewy nuggets inside. On top after baking, I scattered chips, pecans, and homemade caramel drizzle. That part was all great. The brownies themselves were just average. Cakey consistency, not especially chocolatey or sweet, and way too thin  only 1/2 or so. Ehh, Brookes best Bombshell are still my go to brownie. I can just turtle those up when needed.

       These are in the oven now and I cant wait to give them a try. My caramel bits werent as set as yours (more freezer time would have solved that), which I suspect will mean theyll melt a bit more into the mixture.. but Im ok with that. Cant wait!

       I have some salted caramel left over from a different recipe. Do you think I can use that and freeze it and it would work the same even though Ive had it in a jar for a little while?
