    ! All week we will present tips on the what, why and how of the anti-inflammatory diet.

  </p>
  <p>
   Want to prevent inappropriate inflammation, reduce the risk of age-related diseases, and promote optimum health at any age? Then try an anti-inflammatory diet. By aiming for variety, including as much fresh food as possible, minimizing processed and fast foods, and making fruits and vegetables the foundation of your meals, you will be well on your way.
  </p>
  <p>
   For more getting-started steps, try the following:
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
   <li>
    <strong>
     Improve your carbs.
    </strong>
    The majority of carbohydrates in your diet should be in the form of less-refined, less-processed foods with a low glycemic load. You can do this by replacing foods made with white flour with healthier whole and cracked grains, and part-whole-wheat and buckwheat noodles such as Japanese udon and soba.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Replace your cooking oil.
    </strong>
    Whenever you can, use high-quality extra-virgin olive oil as your main cooking fat (for a neutral tasting oil, use expeller-pressed, organic canola oil). Avoid safflower, sunflower, corn, cottonseed, and mixed vegetable oils, as well as butter and margarine.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Decrease your consumption of animal protein.
    </strong>
    Except for fish (such as omega-3 rich wild Alaskan salmon) and reduced-fat dairy products, animal derived protein should be limited. You can easily replace meat with vegetable protein such as beans, legumes and whole soy foods.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Eat more fiber.
    </strong>
    Try to eat 40 grams of fiber a day, simple to do if you increase your consumption of fruit, especially berries, vegetables and whole grains.
   </li>
  </ol>
