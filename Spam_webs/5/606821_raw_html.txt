  <blockquote>
   <h2>
    Alone
   </h2>
   From childhood's hour I have not been
   <br/>
   As others were; I have not seen
   <br/>
   As others saw; I could not bring
   <br/>
   My passions from a common spring.
   <br/>
   From the same source I have not taken
   <br/>
   My sorrow; I could not awaken
   <br/>
   My heart to joy at the same tone;
   <br/>
   And all I loved, I loved alone.
   <br/>
   Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
   <br/>
   Of a most stormy life- was drawn
   <br/>
   From every depth of good and ill
   <br/>
   The mystery which binds me still:
   <br/>
   From the torrent, or the fountain,
   <br/>
   From the red cliff of the mountain,
   <br/>
   From the sun that round me rolled
   <br/>
   In its autumn tint of gold,
   <br/>
   From the lightning in the sky
   <br/>
   As it passed me flying by,
   <br/>
   From the thunder and the storm,
   <br/>
   And the cloud that took the form
   <br/>
   (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
   <br/>
   Of a demon in my view.
   <p>
   </p>
   <h4>
    Edgar Allen Poe
