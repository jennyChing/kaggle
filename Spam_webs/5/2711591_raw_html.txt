         From Europe the protests are hard to understand,
 since, aside from the higher public transport prices, isnt it the case
 that there is today an economic and social situation in Brazil in full 
development? What do you think? Is this a manifestation of the 
middle class that does not feel represented?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The truth is that the idea that there is an economic and social 
situation in Brazil of full development is false. The federal government
 tries to pass off that idea, and it is in the interests of the 
international bourgeoisie (and its mass media) to pass off that idea, 
but it is not true.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It is true that under the [Workers Party's (PT) President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] government there was more growth of 
the economy than under the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government. But we look at this in the 
historical context of Brazil, or if we make the comparison with the 
whole of the world, Brazils growth is very mediocre. The growth rate of
 Brazil in the last ten years is one of the lesser rates in Latin 
America, it is less than the growth of the other called emergent 
countries and so on.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In addition, in both years of the President Dilma Rousseff PT government for which there is
 already data, growth has fallen even more: 2.7% growth of GDP in 2011, 
and 0.9% in 2012. In 2013, in spite of the previous hopes of the 
government of a big recovery, the data already indicate that growth will
 again be mediocre. Of course this is explained, in a good part, by the 
reflection of the bad situation of the world-wide economy (in the same 
way that a good part of the better results of the Lula government is 
explained by the international boom in commodities, impelled above all 
by China), but the point it is that there is no process of significant 
economic growth in Brazil.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        If we think in somewhat broader terms, more in line with the 
hypothesis of development, the evaluation is still worse. In the last 
ten years, Brazil has regressed from the point of view of its industry 
 there is a deindustrialisation process -- and above all from the point 
of view of its external economic relations. It has become an exporter of
 commodities, it has been exporting less industrial products than for 20
 years. At that level, its dependency on the outside has increased.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        But the problems from the economic point of view go still further. In
 recent months there has been a renewed process of inflation -- limited, 
but perceivable (something around 6% in the year is expected). At the 
same time, there is a deterioration of the trade balance (explained, 
partly, by the over-evaluation of the real -- the Brazilian currency -- 
which is imposed in the name of control of inflation). Weak growth, with
 inflation and deterioration of the trade balance is a combination of 
circumstances that restricts much the margin of manoeuvre of the 
government. And as it is a very conservative government from the 
economic point of view, what it tries to do is to more forcibly control 
public spending and to give incentives to capital -- with, until now, 
very little result.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        There is an aspect of the question with which I agree more. It is 
clear that the mobilisations are not only explained, and perhaps not 
even mainly explained, by the relatively bad present economic situation 
(although the price of public transport really is high in terms of 
peoples purchasing power). The indignation against the repression of 
the demonstrations, support for the right to demonstrate, as I have 
already mentioned, has an important weight.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        And that also has an important weight on what the question suggests, I
 would not raise it as the middle-class does not feel represented, but
 more as a lost general legitimacy of the political system. A great part
 of the population feels that the majority parties have policies which 
are very similar (which has been expressed clearly, for example, by the 
fairly similar and in general common performance of both the politicians
 directly responsible for the question of public transport in Sao Paulo,
 mayor Fernando Haddad, of the PT, and governor Geraldo Alckmin, of the

        ).
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It is true that the federal government has had clear majority support
 in recent years, and in particular in the elections. But there were 
surveys published shortly before the beginning of the mobilisations that
 have pointed to a significant fall in that support. And the sector that
 supports the government least is exactly the intermediary wage earning 
sector (a part of the proletariat, of course). The government has 
greater support among the more precarious wage earners, among the 
poorest, the sector that some analysts call the sub-proletariat. But 
even a part of that sector has rebelled  starting precisely from the 
initiatives of breaking into shops and banks, burning cars -- and 
certainly feels exploited and oppressed.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         Which are the social sectors that dominate the economy? Has the economic growth of Brazil benefitted society as a whole?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The Brazilian economy is dominated by an alliance between financial 
capital, big industrial capital and agro business (the big rural 
bourgeoisie), in all cases both national and foreign, with some 
contradictions among them. For industrial capital, for example, the 
policy of over-valuation of the real creates problems, because it makes 
it difficult to compete with imports. But as this capital accepts the 
neoliberal general framework of the economic policy of the government, 
it does not have much margin to make pressure for changes in the policy.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The economic growth of Brazil in the last years -- which exists, 
although it is much less significant than is claimed by the propaganda 
of the government and the praise they have received from the 
international bourgeoisie -- has benefitted mainly financial capital and 
agro business. But something has been distributed also to the poorest 
layers of the society, mainly by the big growth in social assistance 
(most important at this level is the well known Bolsa Familia 
programme) and also by the significant growth of the minimum wage (what 
also has implications for which those who receive pensions, which are 
indexed to the minimum wage). That is the big reason for the greater 
support the federal government has among the poorest layers.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In addition, although the situation of public education is in no way 
good, the federal government has expanded federal university public 
education and has a policy of bursaries that has extended the access of 
more popular sectors to private university education.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Intermediate wage-earners and those that receive higher wages have 
lost out, especially public employees. That is one of it reasons why 
those in what can be classified as average layers (this includes a part 
of the proletariat, including workers) have a much more negative opinion
 of the government.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Sectors like farmers and indigenous peoples (who are not numerous in 
Brazil) have also lost out as the government favours agro business, and 
not peasant agriculture. The federal government has allowed a real 
genocide of indigenous people -- there are many murders of natives 
carried out by the great rural proprietors, and the federal government 
tolerates it as the big rural proprietors (agro business) are an 
important part of the political alliances made to guarantee so-called 
governability.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         What balance sheet do you make of the PT in power?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        I believe that it is possible to summarise the line followed by the 
PT governments as follows: to give something for those at the bottom, 
on condition of not entering into any clash with the dominant classes, 
which implies not making any fundamental change of direction in the 
neoliberal policy supported by those classes. It is a fundamentally 
conservative orientation. The economic situation is feasible enough to 
allow, with the growth of the economy, giving something to those at the 
bottom without taking anything from those above, and the strength of 
Lula, the PT and the organisations it leads was able to contain the 
demands of the workers and oppressed layers of society.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Lula seems to believe, and the PT seems to be convinced by him of 
this, that is possible to govern (more or less) for all, replacing the 
class struggle by negotiation (mainly with those at the top) and control
 (for those at the bottom, when negotiation is not sufficient).
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        At some time -- as seems to be beginning to occur -- that line will 
have to exhaust itself. In the end, the PT governments have not 
eliminated the violent contradictions of Brazilian society, nor the 
dependency of imperialism, nor the contradictions of capitalism. And the
 control on the part of the PT and of their allies, and the 
organisations directed by them, over the demands of those at the bottom,
 cannot be eternal.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        This line has debilitated the workers and popular movement  which 
will remain the case for at least a few years, until they can be 
reorganised. To the PT that seemed until now secondary, because it 
relied on electoral strength, extended by the broad alliances with the 
right that it has been making.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        There are other aspects of the government line that are very 
negative. One that should be emphasised is the contempt for 
environmental questions, reinforced by the alliances with the agro 
business sectors. Another is the opening of space for the religious 
fundamentalist right, also reinforced by the importance that it has in 
its apparatus of alliances.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         When and how were the protests born? What are the demands?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        There are many different and even contradictory demands, that have 
emerged at different moments. But we can consider that the centre of the
 movement has been the city of Sao Paulo, and that the demand that lay
 behind the mobilisations has been for the revocation of the increase in
 the price of the urban transport, from R$3.00 to R$3.20.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The first demonstration was on June 6.There were two more 
demonstrations, they were growing, but nothing extraordinary, some 
thousands of people. On June 13 there was a bigger demonstration, of 
more or less 15,000 people, and this time there was stronger police 
repression than in previous demonstrations. There were than 250 people 
arrested, and a few dozen hurt by rubber bullets or batons. Various 
journalists were arrested or hurt. A photograph of a journalist injured 
by a rubber bullet in the eye was widely disseminated.
       </p>
       <div style="text-align: center">
        <img height="297" src="http://www.solidarity-us.org/files/psollogo.jpg" width="213"/>
       </div>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It was from there that the great growth of the mobilisation in Sao 
Paulo and the nationalisation of the movement too place. And in the 
following demonstration in Sao Paulo, on June 17, alongside the demand 
for the revocation of the increase in the price of urban transport, the 
axis was the protest against the violence of the police.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Between June 13 and 17 there was a great wave of sympathy for the 
demonstrations, and a strong social feeling against of the violence of 
the police and for the right to demonstrate. At this time there was a 
change in the attitude of the big mass media, which passed from an open 
hostility to the unrealism of the demand to a certain sympathy 
(although considering, still, that the price increase had been small and
 so on), and from the attribution of responsibility for the acts of 
violence to the demonstrators themselves to the attribution of the 
responsibility to the military police through its exaggerated response. 
The government of the state decided to change line and to suspend 
(partially) the repression.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The feeling of solidarity with the previous demonstrations, the 
rejection of the police violence, the more favourable attitude of the 
mass media all favoured the explosion of the demonstrations and their 
nationalisation (the press has calculated that were demonstrations in 
more than 400 cities), and at the same time to the broadening of the 
slogans. As I already said, the protest against repression became the 
focus of the motivations; alongside slogans on transport, the most 
common being que coincidencia, sin polica no hay violencia [what a 
coincidence, without the police there is no violence] (since the 
demonstration, virtually until its end, was very calm).
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        At the demonstration of Monday June 17 another important subject was 
the protest against the exorbitant cost of the soccer World Cup and the 
Confederations Cup. There were many slogans of the type I dont want a 
ball, I want school, which rhymes in Portuguese. In the same way there 
were slogans about health and education being more important that 
soccer. They were also many slogans against homophobia, a subject that 
has caused many protest mobilisations against the religious 
fundamentalist right in recent months (there is a great mobilisation of 
public opinion against the draft law that allows homosexuality to be 
treated as a disease, defended by the religious fundamentalist right).
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        At the same time, slogans against corruption took on a stronger 
presence. That corresponds to a popular feeling, of course, but it also 
corresponded to a line of the right wing press. The countrys biggest 
circulation magazine, the right wing Veja, had a cover on the weekend 
of June 15-16 saying the revolt of the young -- after the price of 
travel, now is the time of corruption and criminality. Other press 
organs did not go as far as to propose that youth fight against 
criminality (that is to say, for more police), but also emphasised the 
question of corruption.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        That is: at the same time that the demonstrations have become very 
broad (already in Monday June 17 there were demonstrations in many 
capitals of the country and other cities, with definitely much more than
 100,000 people in Sao Paulo and more than 100,000 in Rio de Janeiro 
according to the mass media), and national, they have also begun to show
 more significant diversity and contradictions.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         Are there similarities with the mobilisations of the indignant in other countries?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        For sure there are many similarities between the protests in Brazil 
and the movements of the indignant in other countries. All are movements
 mainly of youth (although in Brazil there has since June 17 been more 
of a presence of other age groups), all have used means of convening via
 Facebook and other media of that type. There is a feeling of 
indignation in the face of injustice that is a strong component of the 
motivations of the movement. But, naturally, there are many 
specificities in Brazil -- for example, I do not believe that in any 
other country the movement of the indignant has faced a government of a 
party with the history of the PT. It is possible also that in Brazil we 
count more on a network of non-traditional social and popular 
organisations of several types than in other countries.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         Which social sectors are at the origin of the mobilisations? What are their forms of struggle and organisation?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        At the start of the movement against the increase of the price of 
public transport in Sao Paulo it was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimento_Passe_Livre" target="_blank">
         Movimento do Passe Livre
        </a>
        (MPL,
Free Fare Movement), that is 
to say, for free public transport. It is a movement that has existed 
since 2005, and has already had many mobilisations, but never with the 
amplitude of today. It is a movement that is defined as non-partisan and
 anti-hierarchical, horizontal but not anti-party. In general, it has 
had always good relations with the parties more to the left, like the 
PSOL and the United Socialist Workers' Party (PSTU). In fact, the PSOL and the PSTU supported the 
mobilisations from June 6, collaborating with the MPL, and also some 
sectors of the PT have been involved. Organisations of youth close to 
the PSOL (where young PSOL members are active) have had an important 
participation. From the beginning anarchist sectors have also 
participated.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The social base of the MPL is mainly youth of the intermediate layers
 (as are the members of the MPL themselves). There is no doubt that is a
 left movement, and in general more to the left than the PT.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        After June 13, many other movements and organisations have been 
incorporated in the mobilisations and have participated in their 
convocations. In Sao Paulo, there is the MTST (Movimiento de los 
Trabajadores Sin Techo -- Movement of Workers Without a Roof) and 
Periferia Activa , both movements that organise inhabitants of the 
peripheries of the city. Also involved have been sectors of the LGBTI 
movement, women, and youth movements. The governmental left (sectors of 
the PT and the PC do B) have also begun to participate. The 
participation of anarchists has been extended. On the other hand, far 
right groups have begun to participate, to try to change the focus of 
the movement.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In other cities similar sectors have called demonstrations: groups 
that fight for free public transport or against price increases (the MPL
 does not exist throughout the country; in various cities there are 
similar movements), in collaboration with left parties.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In many cities there are Popular Cup Committees, which have for more 
than two years organised a critical mobilisation against not only the 
exorbitant cost of the soccer World Cup, but also against the violations
 of rights of populations removed for work related to the Cup, against 
the exceptional legislation for the Cup ( at FIFAs demand) and so on. 
In many cities, these Committees have had (and continue to have) an 
important participation in the calls for demonstrations. In fact, the 
demonstrations that have been most violently repressed by the police 
have been those near the Confederation Cup games (at FIFAs demand). 
Nonetheless, over the last week there have been more people protesting 
outside the Cup games than within them.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        As of Monday June 17, on the other hand, the convening of the 
demonstrations has been increasingly multiple, thorough Facebook or 
other means, much beyond the capacities of the above mentioned 
organisations. Most of the participants in the movement continue to be 
young people from the intermediate layers (including, obviously, young 
wage-earners), but it has extended to age groups and social layers  
especially the poorer layers of inhabitants of the peripheries of the 
big cities.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         What relationship does the present movement have with the 
other social movements: the landless, the homeless and so on? Is there 
articulation between this social movement and other sectors?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        As I explained in the previous question, there is an important 
participation of movements of the homeless, of movements of youth, 
movements of inhabitants of the peripheries, and the Popular Cup 
Committees. In some cities, the Movement of Landless Rural
Workers (MST) has also supported the 
demonstrations, even though they are demonstrations of the urban 
population.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        On the other hand, there is no relation, or there is no good 
relation, between the present mobilisations and the organised labour 
movement. We can say that the participation of the working class as a 
class is not noticeable, even though the national trade union federation CUT (and also other unions I 
believe) has begun to support demonstrations formally. I believe that 
the most important difficulty for this -- and this also affects, to a 
certain extent, the relations between the movement expressed in the 
demonstrations and the MST -- is in the control of the CUT by the federal
 government and the excessive proximity of the MST with that same 
government. The tone of the movement is very naturally against of the 
federal government (in addition to being against the state governments 
and the municipalities in general).
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         From Europe it is seen as perplexing that in the country of 
soccer people are mobilised as the World Cup approaches, demanding less 
soccer and more investment in other sectors (education, health and so 
on). Can you explain this?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In fact, also for us, Brazilians, that was one of the reasons for the
 surprise at the breadth of the demonstrations. But it is not difficult 
to find the explanation. The Confederations Cup (and the same applies 
still more to the World Cup) is not done so that the people can 
participate. The tickets are expensive. In addition, and more important 
than that, the whole process of organisation of the so-called 
mega-events (World Cup, Olympic Games, Confederations Cup) is 
scandalous, and offends the feeling of justice of the people. The cost 
is very high, the benefit to the companies is very great, the demands of
 FIFA -- a true state of emergency -- are absurd. A part of the population
 suffers through the removals.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Already for more than two years there has been work by popular 
organisations, grouped in the Popular Cup Committees, to call attention 
to the absurdity of the policy of mega-events. I believe that, instead
 of acting as a reducer of the mobilisations, the Confederations Cup has
 strongly impelled them. The feeling of justice, the indignation against
 injustice of the people has spoken louder than the taste for soccer.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         What has been the response from the government to the demands of the movement? Are there contradictions in the state apparatus?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The government, or rather, the different governments, of different 
parties, throughout the country, has yielded on the question of the 
prices of urban transport. On that initial subject, the movement has 
gained a clear and rapid victory.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In addition, the president of the republic, Dilma, made a speech on 
Friday June 21 promising to hear the voice of the streets, saying that
 she will not tolerate disturbances (arruaas) (and overall will 
guarantee the security of the games of the Confederations Cup) while 
proposing a national pact for public services. That is, she has not 
defined any change of political direction; she has said that she will do
 the same thing with more efficiency and more coordination with the 
governors of states and municipalities. As yet it is too early to say 
what impact it will have, but, for the moment, it does not seem that 
there is any change in the situation. The mobilisations continue, and 
more are predicted for the coming days.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        There were many more similarities than differences in the responses 
of the different governments from different parties, the PT and their 
allies, and of the right wing opposition. I do not believe that we can, 
at the moment, speak of contradictions in the state apparatus.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         What relationship is there between this movement and the 
left? is it non-political? Do you think that it is being recuperated by 
the right?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        I have already given some elements that are part of the answer to 
that question. The movement has a clearly non-partisan tendency (in the 
sense that there is a strong distrust in relation to the parties), 
although I would not call it in any way non-political.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The initial tendency of the movement was very clearly to the left: 
the slogan for free public transport (or the revocation of the price 
increases) is clearly of the left. Other subjects of the movement, like 
the criticism of the exorbitant cost of the World Cup, the defence of 
better health and education, are also of the left, as are the slogans 
against homophobia, for example.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        On the other hand, from the demonstration of Thursday June 13 in Sao 
Paulo, when it was clear that the movement would experience great 
growth, the right -- including the extreme right -- began to intervene in 
the movement, through the mass media and direct presence in the 
demonstrations.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        On Thursday June 20 in several cities, mainly Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro, where there were the biggest demonstrations, the aggressive 
presence of far right groups, with the collaboration of police 
provocateurs, gained a partial victory, expelling people who carried 
flags of parties or movements from the demonstration. In Sao Paulo, that
 began against the flags of the PT, but later it was extended to flags 
of other parties or movements. And it went as far as attacks on people 
who simply dressed in red clothes.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Those aggressions have reflected the spontaneous feeling of distrust 
towards the parties, which is for two different reasons: the loss of 
prestige of the institutional parties (including people that support the
 government but do not have a positive view of the parties who compose 
it) and what is seen, with some reason, as the opportunism of the left 
parties, who, by taking huge banners and placing themselves at the front
 of demonstrations give the impression that a great part of the people 
who demonstrate support them. In addition, that feeling very was 
reinforced by the bourgeois mass media, who seek to reinforce the 
feeling that all must be united under the Brazilian flag.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        I do not believe, however, that the movement is being recuperated by 
the right, nor that it can be. What exists is a great dispute about 
directions and slogans. It is very important to indicate, meanwhile, 
that until now what has been obtained concretely -- the revocations of 
the increases of the prices of urban transport throughout the country -- 
have been victories of the left.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It is interesting to observe that the announcement of that revocation
 in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and several other cities, was done on 
 Wednesday June 19 (other cities already had done it before). The 
demonstration of June 20 in those cities, that had already been called, 
was maintained as a commemoration. The feeling of victory broadened 
the demonstration (the media have spoken of more than 300,000 people in 
Rio de Janeiro, for example), but, at the same time, left it without any
 clear unifying slogan.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        A key question is that significant sections of the people have had 
the experience of mobilising massively, they have gained victories, and 
they have liked it. That can be exhausted by fatigue later, but I do not
 believe that it can be recuperated by the right.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         What problems does this movement raise for the PT?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The situation of the PT is very difficult, at least immediately. 
There is no doubt that it was the party that has lost the most with the 
mobilisations. Mainly, a good part of its discourse of recent years has 
been undermined: it cannot continue saying that there is a process of 
development in Brazil and that the people are satisfied. And one of its 
central orientations, the policy of the mega-events, has failed 
completely. The Confederations Cup, which it thought would be an 
opportunity to increase its prestige, has resulted in an immense 
erosion.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It is the first time in its history that the PT has faced big mass 
mobilisations that are hostile to it. From the beginning of the Lula 
government -- already with the very conservative pension reform 
(Previdencia) -- the PT was used to dealing with you strikes and 
mobilisations opposing its governments. Often it has negotiated, 
counting on the collaboration of most of the union leadership, other 
times it has resorted to the repression. But even the biggest 
mobilisation against one of its governments -- the mobilisation around 
pension reform -- cannot be compared with the bulk of the mobilisations 
that exist today.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        That is causing, obviously, a deep discontent in the PT. Before 
Thursday June 20, the president of the party, Rui Falco, made a call to
 activists of the PT to participate in the demonstrations with its 
flags. The result was a disaster: it was seen by many of the 
demonstrators as a provocation, it was one of the things that 
facilitated the far right groups in expelling activists with party and 
movement flags.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The predominant tendency in the PT now, and mainly of the sectors 
that support it from a position more to the left, like the MST in recent
 years, has been to call for unity with all the left (that is, with the 
left opposition to the governments of the PT), to stand together 
against the right. But this is very contradictory with the fact that 
the governments of the PT do not show any opening, any change of 
direction. They maintain the same line that has caused (and continues 
causing) the demonstrations. It is evident that the opposition from the 
left to the governments of the PT cannot accept an alliance on those 
bases.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         And what problems does the movement raise for the radical 
left? What are the challenges that face these mobilisations at the 
moment, so that they do not peter out?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        A first question is to reach a good understanding of what has 
happened. The radical left has been also surprised at the breadth of the
 mobilisations, and with the complexity of the struggle that then occurs
 between sectors of left and right in the demonstrations. We are 
advancing, I believe, in the understanding of the situation.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        A second question is the relationship with the PT and the parties 
that are their satellites, like the Communist Party of Brazil (PC do B), and the question of what 
unity of the left to look for. There is a pressure from these sectors in
 favour of unity of the left. There is then a debate in the different 
sectors of the radical left, but I believe that the tendency is very 
clear, and correct: we can make no alliance with sectors that defend 
(although it is a supposedly critical defence) of the governments of 
the PT.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The unity of the left that we must look for is with the sectors that 
are located in opposition to the governments of the PT (and, obviously, 
in opposition to the governments of the right opposition to the federal 
government). That includes anarchists, non-party and movementist 
sectors, like the MPL of Sao Paulo.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In that framework, a trap that should be avoided is the debate on 
party flags. By all means parties have the right to have and to carry 
flags -- but it is necessary to then find the best way to combine the 
defence of the legitimacy of the participation of party activists in the
 mobilisations, without giving the impression (and in many cases it is 
hardly an impression) of wanting to appear as the leadership of the 
movement and without dishonestly giving the idea that all the 
demonstrators support the party. There are other party symbols that are 
much more acceptable, like, for example, party t-shirts.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The central dispute is not about the brand of the parties, but the 
political direction of the movement, its demands and slogans. With that
 we pass to another challenge, that is to find (along with all the 
sectors that impel the movement) the best demands and slogans to advance
 now. Here, there are some more or less clear ideas. The question of 
urban transport -- to advance towards free transport or, perhaps, free 
transport for young people or something in this line, the question of 
the quality of that transport -- continues as an important axis.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        This week, two other questions tend to have priority: the protests 
against the Confederations Cup (and the expense in general of the 
mega-events), and the fight against the draft law that allows treating
 homosexuality as a disease, defended by the religious fundamentalist 
right. Already there was a big demonstration in Sao Paulo strictly on 
that subject (Friday June 21), with more than 10,000 people, and that is
 a subject that has had great presence on many of the broadest 
manifestations. The subject is in debate in the House of 
Representatives, and many deputies already begin to show opposition. A 
short term victory seems very probable.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Finally, the hardest challenge is the dispute with the right 
(especially in the big mass media) and with the groups of extreme right.
 A way to handle that dispute is exactly to call demonstrations with 
clear demands and slogans, in which the demonstrators will have an 
inclination naturally to the left, and the right and far right groups 
will -- if they participate -- be isolated. 
The unity of the non-governmental left is another way to face the right.
And, in addition, it will be necessary to take care of more of the 
organisational aspects, like the protection of the demonstrators against
 provocations.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        <b>
         How would you define the political situation in Brazil today?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        There are signals that the policy that the PT in power has followed --
 to give something for those at the bottom, on condition of not 
entering any clash with the dominant classes -- is exhausting itself. The
 PT has been, without doubt, the party that has been most affected by 
the demonstrations, as well as the other parties either allied to the PT
 (like the PMDB, of the governor of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio Cabral, very 
much attacked by the demonstrators) or opposing it (like the PSDB, of 
the governor of Sao Paulo), which have also been affected.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        I do not believe that there is any possibility of a coup from the 
right, as some sectors of the PT have raised. The right has no reason 
to mount a coup: the government of the PT cannot be the government of 
its dreams, but it serves it well. In this crisis, the parties of the 
right have behaved in a very similar way to the PT. What interests the 
right is to take advantage of the crisis to erode the PT (talking a lot 
 through the mass media -- of corruption, trying to make it seem that the
 problem of corruption is more of a federal than a state level 
question) and to be better placed for the next elections.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It is not clear where the movement will go, nor to what extent it 
will represent a change in the correlation of forces. We have 
indications that the movement has the strength to go forward, can win 
more victories, but it does not seem probable that it will lead to a 
more fundamental change by itself. A key question is self-limitation: 
although the loss of legitimacy of the political system is strong, the 
movement does not pose the objective of changing the political regime or
 the government, and we are far from que se vayan todos.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It seems sure, on the other hand, that some change in the correlation
 of forces will result from the mobilisations. The PT and their 
satellites have lost a lot, the right opposition has also lost, although
 less. The organisations, the social movement close to the PT and their 
allies, like the CUT, which are already highly bureaucratised, are 
probably going to lose something. More independent organisations, like 
the different organisations which have impelled the mobilisations, will 
probably be strengthened.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Passing to the non-governmental political parties (which are much 
weaker than the PT or the right opposition parties), we can evaluate, 
until now, that a party that is going be strengthened is Rede 
Sustentabilidade [Sustainability Network] led by Marina Silva, a 
party still in the process of obtaining registration. It is a party 
that, already from its name, tries to create the impression that it is 
not a party. It has a clean image and it is not in any government.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The PSOL, probably, has also already benefitted from the movement, 
and could benefit more, although it appears to many of the demonstrators
 as somehow similar to the PT, since it is a left party, and the PT is 
still seen by the masses as the major representative of the left, and 
the feeling of distrust of the parties in general is strong. The PSOL is
 the party that is more in tune with the demands that have given origin 
to the movement. In addition, their militants (including its 
parliamentarians) have participated from the beginning in the 
mobilisations -- especially their younger militants. It is sure that the 
youth organisations close to the PSOL already have more authority, and 
they are going to go stronger. In any case, many things will be decided 
in the struggles of the coming days and weeks.

       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        At the moment, at the national level, there is no credible 
alternative to the left of the PT. We are still in the initial phases of
 the reconstruction of the Brazilian anti-capitalist left, after the 
blow that it has suffered with the adhesion of the PT to bourgeois 
institutionalism. The PSOL, the main political alternative to the left 
of the PT, is still very weak, and has, in addition, many internal 
contradictions. It can be a credible alternative in some cities, as in 
the elections of October 2012, but not at the national level.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The main immediate challenge that the anti-capitalist left has then 
is to contribute to the development of the movement, in the sense 
already discussed above. If it can do this, it will also advance in the 
process of its reconstruction  and build itself as a credible 
alternative to the left of the PT.

        <b>
         What do you think of the proposals by the Brazilian president
 to call a referendum and to devote 100% of oil profits to health and 
education?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The first proposal was the calling of a popular plebiscite 
authorising the operation of a specific constituent process for 
political reform. It was initially presented as a plebiscite to decide 
on a constituent assembly exclusively to carry out political reform; the
 following day, the idea of a constituent assembly was rejected, and 
replaced by the idea of a plebiscite with questions on political reform.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        This proposal, obviously, is an attempt to respond to the clear loss 
of legitimacy of the political system, which is clear from the 
demonstrations. In the first version, of a constituent assembly, it 
could be an opportunity for effective change (which would depend, among 
other questions, on the rules for the election of the constituents). In 
the second version, it is much worse. The people would respond to some 
questions, after an electoral campaign where the big mass media would 
have much influence -- as happens in general in bourgeois elections -- and
 the very unsatisfactory present Congress would give the final form to 
the political reform. The probability that there is a significant 
improvement is small; everything is going to depend on the continuity of
 the popular mobilisation to put pressure on the Congress, in the first 
place so that the questions posed in the plebiscite are not those that 
the present Congress would wish to propose.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The second proposal mentioned, of the several proposals given by 
Dilma on Monday, was that of devoting 100% of oil royalties of and 50% 
of the oil resources of the pre-salt layer that would be received by the
 various levels of government (federal, state and municipal) to 
education. That proposal was already changed the following day by the 
Chamber of Deputies, which approved a proposal of 75% of the oil 
royalties for education and 25% for health. The project will have to be 
discussed in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        It is not known what will be the final result, but it is necessary to
 point out that this proposal, in whatever version, very is limited and 
has very bad aspects. The most significant oil royalties are expected to
 come from oil from the pre-salt layer, which has not yet begun to be 
exploited. These resources will be very limited for the next few years 
and will add little to the present resources. The proposal by sectors of
 the left linked to the fight for education is that of 10% of GDP to go 
to public education (now) -- already a viable proposal, although it would
 require a substantial change in the budget -- for example, with the 
reduction of the cost of the public debt, through an audit of the 
latter.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        On the other hand, the position of the eco-socialist movement is 
opposed to the exploitation of oil from the pre-salt layer, because of 
the great environmental problems involved. In addition, in the 
predicted model of operation most of the oil profits would go to private
 companies. In conclusion, the slogan 100% of the pre-salt layer oil 
royalties for education, very popular among sectors of the left that 
support the government, is bad in many senses.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        Since Monday June 24, the different levels of government, the Chamber
 of Deputies and the Senate are having a bullfight to see who can 
announce more good things, which can be presented as a response to the 
voice of the streets. What has been announced -- or decided, in some 
cases -- is the reduction of the price of public transport (very varied 
according to the several levels of government responsible, in the 
different states and cities), including several announcements of free 
passes for students. Another very positive thing is the expected 
withdrawal in the next few days of the draft law that allows the 
treatment of homosexuality as a disease -- the so-called gay cure. We 
need more time to be able to make a clearer evaluation of what has been 
won -- because the mobilisations continue, on a smaller scale, but more 
numerous and diversified than the previous week.

         What has happened in the past few days? Anything new?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        In addition to the continuity of the mobilisations, a very rich 
process of extension of the political discussion is underway, of 
meetings of different sectors (youth, inhabitants of the peripheries, 
movements for public transport, movements for education and so on) by 
far more people than before, to discuss what to do and what to demand in
 particular. The unions, not very active until now, have announced (with
 even the more right wing federations participating) a general strike 
and a day of protests for July 11, with a very progressive basis. Most 
of the social movements, even those nearest to the government, have 
supported this call by the unions and present their own demands -- also 
very progressive. Ex-president Lula has met with some social sectors 
close to him and says that it is time to go for the streets to face 
the right and to push the government towards the left. Evidently, that 
position of Lula has some fairly comedic elements to it, but it is an 
expressive sign of what is happening in the country.
       </p>
       <p style="font-size: 11pt">
        The threat from the right, which seemed significant at the end of 
last week, is much more limited. Some mobilisations with clearly 
rightist orientations that have been tried were clearly a total defeat.

        We do not know if all the popular and union mobilisations announced 
will really happen, nor their strength. After the last ten years, it is 
difficult to think that the very bureaucratised CUT will really flex its
 muscles, not to speak the more rightwing federations. The same can be 
said of an organisation like the highly bureaucratised UNE (National 
Union of Students), one of the organisations which has met with Lula. 
The sectors of the socialist left in the different movements, which are 
being strengthened, for sure, with the present process, are still very 
much in the minority.

        But something we can say with great certainty is that the political 
participation of the people has taken a qualitative leap; lets hope 
that its consciousness does the same. Brazil is no longer the same, 
thats for sure.
