     <h4>
      1) What is the Word of God concerning marijuana, or
         cannabis hemp ?
     </h4>
     <p>
      The hemp plant (scientific name: cannabis, slang name:
         marijuana) is but one of the many useful herbs "yielding
         seed after its kind" (Genesis 1:12, 29) blessed by God on
         the third day of creation for people to use in conjunction
         with our free will. The only place in the Bible where
         Cannabis was mentioned by name got switched into 'calamus'
         by the King James translators as part of a holy ointment
         (described in Exodus 30:23).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Bible also predicted prohibition: "In the later
         times, some shall  speak lies in hypocrisy 
         commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to
         be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know
         the truth." (Paul: 1 Timothy 1-4) Nowhere in the Bible does
         it say people cannot grow, possess, use or even smoke
         cannabis or that hemp is bad. In fact, quite the contrary:
         "God said, 'Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed
         which is upon the face of all the earth.To you it will
         be for meat.'  And God saw everything that he had
         made, and, behold, it was very good." (Genesis 1:29-31)
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      2) How was the cannabis plant used by people during
         Biblical times?
     </h4>
     <p>
      Cannabis was widely used throughout the world since
         earliest times. 'Cana' got its name from the same root word
         as "cannabis," indicating that hemp was grown there. The
         Bible also describes a common way of preparing marijuana for
         medicinal use: "The Lord said Afore harvest, when the
         bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower,
         he shall cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away
         and cut down the branches." (Isaiah 18:4-5)
     </p>
     <p>
      Cannabis was traditionally used in 12 different ways: as
         clothing, paper, cord, sails, fishnet, oil, sealant,
         incense, food, and in ceremony, relaxation and medicine. And
         it was written, "On either side of the river, was there the
         tree of life, which bare 12 manner of fruits, and yielding
         her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for
         the healing of the nations." (Rev. 22:1-2)
     </p>
     <p>
      The leaves and flowers of cannabis are well known for
         their medicinal value, and the Thracians Scythians and
         Zoroastrians were just a few of the groups that were using
         cannabis socially during Jesus day.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      3) What about cannabis today?
     </h4>
     <p>
      Hemp today has thousands of uses. Modern technology has
         devised many new uses for the helpful hemp plant -- like
         biomass energy, construction materials, fuel oil, plastic
         and so on. It is used worldwide as medicine. It is among the
         best food crops on Earth, and is ecological, as well as a
         popular relaxant and a spiritual tool.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unfortunately, during the 20th century, new anti-drug
         laws have been made by man to imprison, seize property, and
         even apply the death penalty for people caught growing
         cannabis in accordance with God's law.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      4) What does the Bible say about drugs?
     </h4>
     <p>
      Alcohol is the only drug openly discussed in the Bible,
         so it must serve as our reference. Jesus began his public
         life by miraculously turning water into wine at the Wedding
         at Cana (John 2:1-10) when the wine ran out at the
         celebratory party. Wine is symbolically drunk during
         religious occasions such as Passover  -- the Last Supper
         of Jesus and His disciples. It continues to be a traditional
         sacrament in today's standard church services. Yet the
         simple joys of God-given pleasures were also sung: "He
         causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
         service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the
         earth; And wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to
         make his face to shineth." (Psalm 104:14-15)
     </p>
     <p>
      The Bible distinguishes between use and misuse: "Give
         strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto
         those that be of heavy hearts." (Proverbs 31:6-7) as well as
         "Woe unto them that  follow strong drink; that
         continue until night, till wine inflame them!" (Isaiah
         5:10)
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      5) What do the 10 Commandments say about people using
         marijuana?
     </h4>
     <p>
      In the 10 Commandments, God ordered that man shalt not
         hold cannabis or anything else as a 'false god,' 'not covet'
         it, 'not steal' it and 'not lie' about it (Ex. 20:1-17).
         Unfortunately, the US government has done nothing but lie
         about cannabis for most of this century. The result of all
         this is that these lies have been used to rationalize the
         arrest of more than 10 million Americans for marijuana;
         695,201 in 1997 alone, and 87% of them for personal
         possession. This is a good example of why the Bible also
         warns that "If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are
         wicked." (Prov. 29:12)
     </p>
     <h4>
      The Ten Commandments:
     </h4>
     <p>
      1. No false Gods.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Worship no graven images.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Do not use God's name in vain.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Keep the Sabbath day holy; no work permitted.
     </p>

      5. Honor your father and mother.

      6)
         How did Jesus speak of marijuana?
     </h4>
     <p>
      Although Jesus lived among a society with many cannabis
         smokers, He never chastised the practice and warned us not
         to criticize other people for their habits or for whatever
         they consume. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth
         a man; that which cometh out of the mouth defileth a man."
         (Mat. 15:11) The Apostle Paul wrote, "I know, and am
         persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean
         of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean,
         to him it is unclean. For the kingdom of God is not meat and
         drink; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
         Ghost." (Paul: Romans 14: 2,3,13,14,17)
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      7) What did Jesus say about the role of government?
     </h4>
     <p>
      He said to keep church and state separate. "Render
         therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto
         God the things which be God's." (Luke 20:25) As we have
         already seen, it was God, not government, who gave man the
         seed bearing herbs to use and government, not God, who
         forbade us to use them. Jesus elaborated on this theme: "A
         good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
         corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that
         bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the
         fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." Matt.
         7:18-20)
     </p>
     <p>
      Certainly the Drug War is just such a branch of
         government that has borne no good fruit, and should be cast
         into the fire.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      8) Who did Jesus say has the right to judge others for
         their lifestyle choices?
     </h4>
     <p>
      Jesus reserved judgement for God alone. " 'Judge not,
         that ye be not judged. For with what judgement ye judge, ye
         shall be judged' " (Matthew 7:1-4). And " 'Let him who is
         without sin cast the first stone' " (John 8:7).
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      9) What did Jesus say about crime and punishment?
     </h4>
     <p>
      Jesus preached love and forgiveness. "Peter said, 'Lord,
         how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
         Till seven times?' Jesus saith unto him, 'I say not unto
         thee until seven times: But until seventy times seven.' "
         (Mat. 18:21-22) Today's mandatory minimum penalties for
         marijuana conspiracy can exceed 25 years to life, with no
         hope of parole, for people who cultivate, exchange or
         otherwise enjoy this natural herb.
     </p>
     <p>
      He also warned us about seizure and forfeiture laws.
         "Beware of the scribes which devour widows'
         houses. The same shall receive greater damnation."
         (Luke 20:46-47) In fact, Jesus was a victim of property
         seizure: "The soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took
         His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part."
         (John. 19:33)
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h4>
      10) What, then, is the Judeo-Christian response to
         marijuana prohibition?
     </h4>
     <p>
      What would Jesus do? He told his followers to show
         tolerance, compassion and unselfishness in every effort to
         end the persecution of God's children. He told us to visit
         those in prison, and when it comes to the Drug War, remember
         His words, "Blessed are the peacemakers." (Matthew 5:9) This
         is reinforced in older texts, in which was written, "My
         people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have
         rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you will be
         no priest to Me for I desired mercy and not
         sacrifice." (Hosea 4:6, 6:6) "The Lord hath sent me to
         bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the
         captives and the opening of the prison to them that are
         bound." (Isaiah 61:1)
     </p>
     <p>
      Prisons and drug wars do not save souls. It was God who
         created cannabis hemp and told mankind to use "every green
         herb" on Earth. "They persecute me wrongfully; help thou
         me." (Ps. 119:86) Jesus himself said, "Whatever you do to
         the least of my brothers, that you do unto me
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in either the Bible or the U.S. Constitution says
         politicians can imprison those who follow their conscience
         and use cannabis in good faith. "Every creature of God is
         good, and nothing to be refused if it be received with
         thanksgiving. If thou put the brethren in remembrance
         of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus
         Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good
         doctrine." (Paul: 1 Timothy 4;1-6) "My people are destroyed
         for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge,
         I will also reject you, that you will be no priest to
         Mefor I desired mercy and not sacrifice." (Hosea 4:6,
         6:6)
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <hr/>
     <h2>
      Summary analysis of the foregoing discussion
     </h2>
     <p>
      What does the Bible say about marijuana? The Bible says
         that God created hemp for people to use "as meat," (ie, to
         consume), that its seed oil is to be used as an ointment,
         and that cannabis is "to be received with thanks-giving of
         them which believe and know the truth." Paul also warned
         that some people would "speak lies in hypocrisy" and
         prohibit us from using it.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also says that we "shall not bear false witness" about
         people who use cannabis, nor judge them because that
         judgement is reserved to the Lord. The Lord hates those who
         speak lies and sow discord among brethern. For those people
         harrassed and imprisoned for using cannabis rightfuly, Jesus
         offers these words of comfort, "Blessed are those persecuted
         for righteousness's sake: For theirs is the Kingdom of
         Heaven."

      What would Jesus do regarding
         medical marijuana?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Despite common knowledge and widespread scientific
         support, the federal government has for nearly 30 years kept
         cannabis in schedule 1 as a deliberate way to deny patients
         access to medical marijuana. This includes people suffering
         from asthma, cancer, migraine headache, chronic pain,
         spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, and provides relief for
         many other conditions. As a result, people at various
         locations across the USA have had to risk and suffer years
         in prison for providing medical marijuana to patients as an
         act of compassion and personal conscience. What would Jesus
         do? He chose to break the law in order to heal the sick.
     </p>
     <p>
      "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the
         corn, and his disciples were hungered, and began to pluck
         the ears of corn, and to eat. 2) But when the Pharisees saw
         it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which
         is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day 3) But he said unto
         them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungered,
         and they that were with him?  10) And, behold, there
         was a man which had his hand withered, And they asked him,
         saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they
         might accuse him. 11) And he said unto them, What man shall
         there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it
         fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on
         it and lift it out? 12) How much then is a man better than a
         sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath
         days. 13) Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine
         hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole,
         like as the other. 14) Then the Pharisees went out, and held
         a council against him, how they might destroy him. 15) But
         when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence, and
         great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; 16)
         And charged them that they should not make him known."

      Should people give blind obedience to government?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
         Jerusalem, saying, 2) Why do thy disciple transgress the
         tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when
         they eat bread." 3) But he answered and said unto them, Why
         do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your
         tradition?  7) Ye hypocrites!  12) Then came his
         disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the
         Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 13)
         But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
         Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 14) Let them
         alone: they be blind leaders of the blind, And if the blind
         lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. (Matthew

      And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed

      The Lord said unto me, "I will take my rest and I will

      One believeth that he may eat all things.
         Anothereateth herbs.  Let us not, therefore
         judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no
         man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his
         brother's way. I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus,
         that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that
         esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. For
         the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness
         and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. (Paul: Romans 14:

      In the later times, some shall  speak lies in
         hypocrisy  commanding to abstain from meats which God
         hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which
         believe and know the truth. Every creature of God is good,
         and nothing to be refused if it be received with
         thanksgiving. For it is sanctified by the word of God and
         prayer. If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these
         things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,
         nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.

      And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
         crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
         Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side
         of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve
         manner of fruits, and yielding her fruit every month; and
         the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
