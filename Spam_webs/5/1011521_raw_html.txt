           Vertebrae and Teeth and Estimating Size of "Megatooth"

          Today, the only remains of the largest meat-eating fish to ever
live, are a few vertebrae and teeth. The teeth of the giant "Megatooth"
shark are prized by amateur fossil collectors and are known from Europe,
Africa, Australia, India, Japan, North and South America. John Maisey,
curator of vertebrate paleontology at the American Museum 
of Natural History (AMNH), wrote in his 1996 book
          <u>
           Discovering
          </u>
          <u>
           Fossil
          </u>
          <u>
           Fishes
          </u>
          , 
(p. 91) "Many other sharks, including some from the Devonian,
replaced and discarded their teeth with greater abandon. Shark tooth
production must rank as one of the most efficient organic methods of
removing phosphate from the biological environment and burying it in
sediment. There probably is more phosphate in a single 15-centimeter
Miocene fossil white shark tooth than was used during the whole life of a
meter-long Devonian shark. Fossil teeth provide dramatic testimony of
increasing phosphate consumption during the evolution of sharks." In 1982,
Maisey was hired by the Smithsonian Institution to reconstruct a more
accurate representation of the "Megatooth". Previous reconstructions had
been made of "Megatooth's" jaws but now Maisey was aided by Pete
Harmatuk's (an amateur fossil collector) find of a partial set of
          <i>
           C.
megalodon
          </i>
          teeth from a North Carolina phosphate quarry. Prior to this,
only individual vertebrae similar to the modern ones seen in
          <a href="megatoothfigures.htm">
           Fig. 1
          </a>
          and
separate teeth (see
          <a href="megatoothfigures.htm">
           Figs. 2-4
          </a>
          ) were known to science. The closest living
analogue, and closest living relative to the giant "Megatooth" shark is the
Great White Shark
          <i>
           Carcharodon carcharias
          </i>
          (Linnaeus, 1758). The Great White
Shark has been used as a model to reconstruct the giant "Megatooth". Maisey
used the partial set of "Megatooth" teeth to make a more accurate
comparison with jaws of the living Great White Shark. In 1985, the new
reconstruction went on public display. Unhappily for science fiction
writers, the "new" "Megatooth" jaws were two-thirds the size of the jaws
reconstructed by Bashford Dean before WWI at New York's AMNH. In Dean's
day, scientists still believed that the living Great White Shark reached
up to 35 to 40 feet in length. So it was not unbelievable to estimate
"Megatooth" reaching 100 to 120 feet in length when it had teeth three
times the size of a Great White Shark.

          Just as humans have different types of teeth in their jaws
(incisors, canines, premolars, molars). "Megatooth" also had different
functional teeth in different areas of its upper and lower jaws (see
          <a href="megatoothfigures.htm">
           Fig.
3
          </a>
          ). Applegate and Espinosa-Arrubarrena (1996) aided by the new discovery
of a second known associated set of teeth for "Megatooth", described by
Uyeno et al. (1989), have published an artificial dental formula for
"Megatooth".

          The upper jaw, starting near the symphysial joint where both the right and
left sides of the jaw meet at the midline, has two 
Anteriors (A I &amp; II), followed by one Intermediate (Int 1), seven Laterals
(L 7), and four Posteriors (P 4). The lower jaw differs in having three
anteriors (a i-iii), no intermediate, eight laterals (l 8), and four
posteriors (p 4). The first two Anteriors (A I &amp; II) and the second
Lateral (L 2) of the upper jaw were the largest teeth in the mouth of a
"Megatooth". Mike Gottfried
          <i>
           et al.
          </i>
          (1996, p. 60) published a formula that
can be used to calculate the size of the Megatooth specimen on the basis
of the A II tooth height and another graph that can be used to predict the
weight of the shark. The "Megatooth's" Total Length in meters = ((0.96) X
(Total height of tooth in mm)) minus (0.22). Using this formula, the
largest "Megatooth" specimen (Fig. 4) in the University of Alberta
Paleontology Collections was calculated as coming from a shark 14.7 m
(48.4 feet) long and weighing 35,000 kg (77,092 lbs).

Florence, published a little book in 1667,
          <i>
           The Head of a Shark Dissected.
          </i>
          In this book he argued the similarities between the teeth of a modern day
shark and the "Tongue stones" dug out for centuries from the soft rocks in
the cliffs of the island of Malta. He argued these were the teeth of long
dead sharks and published what John Maisey credits as the first published
illustration (a
          <i>

          tooth) of a fossil, and making Steno the

           "Megatooth", a Taxonomic Controversy

          <br/>
          Welton and Farish (1993, p. 18) wrote there are at least 65 
nominal species for the Miocene "Megatooth" shark because of the failure
of earlier paleontologists to understand how much variation exists in
tooth shape. Different tooth rowgroup positions, variations, ontogenetic
stages and even pathologies were ascribed to new species and even new
genera in some cases. Also, fossil and modern sharks can have worldwide
distributions but some early shark paleontologists would describe new
species based only on geographic separation despite a lack of
morphological separation. There is currently disagreement among
paleontologists as to which family "Megatooth" belongs. Applegate (1991,
personal communication) and Applegate and Espinosa-Arrubarrena (1996) want
to place
          <i>
           Carcharodon
          </i>
          in its own family Carcharodontidae. Martin (1996),
based on an analysis of the mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Great White
Shark and other sharks, places
          <i>
           Carcharodon
          </i>
          in the Family Lamnidae (the
more traditional view) along with the genera
          <i>
           Isurus
          </i>
          and
          <i>
           Lamna
          </i>
          . There is a
raging controversy in the shark circle of scientists as to what genus
"Megatooth" belongs [
          <i>
           Carcharodon
          </i>
          versus
          <i>
           Carcharocles
          </i>
          ]. Back in the frontier
days of the "Dinosaur Wars" between Cope and Marsh in the American West,
collectors from the different camps would take potshots at each other with
their rifles. Today's scientists battle it out on the internet.  For
example, see the website of Jim Bourdon, an elasmobranch enthusiast, who
is providing a history of the debate at:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          http://www.elasmo.com/selachian/gw/cvc_intr.html
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In a sense, the internet battles can be just as life-threatening. A 
too impassioned response to an electronic bulletin board may influence one
of the few judges for the dwindling supply of research money to cut your
funds and end your career as a research scientist.

          E. Casier (1960) questioned the monophyly of
          <i>
           Carcharodon
          </i>
          and split
it into three genera, using the generic name

           Carcharocles
          </i>
          for Megatooth.
Henri Cappetta (1987) followed Casier and wrote,

to be derived from

          <i>
           Carcharocles

what Applegate and Espinosa-Arrubarrena (1996) envision is the evolution of
"Megatooth". The Late Cretaceous shark
          <i>
           Cretolamna appendiculata
          </i>
          , through
maybe five or six intermediate species, eventually gave rise to the Early
Miocene
          <i>
           Carcharodon subauriculatus
          </i>
          , that may have given rise to
"Megatooth". And, there is even disagreement how many species are present
in the genus
          <i>
           Carcharodon
          </i>
          . Applegate and Espinosa-Arrubarrena (1996), list
nine described and undescribed species, while Purdy (1996) lists eleven.

          Although the Great White does not feed exclusively on seals it has 
been shown they are an important prey item. When the population of seals
increases, so does the numbers of Great Whites (Purdy, 1996). Although it
first appeared in the Eocene, it was during the Miocene the mammalian
order Cetacea (whales) reached its highest diversity and abundance. Almost
every known family of toothed and baleen whale are known from the end of
the Miocene. Large whale vertebrae and flipper bones have been found with
large bite marks made by serrated teeth that match the teeth of
          <i>
           C.
megalodon
          </i>
          (Purdy, 1996). Also, identified "high-use" areas by marine
vertebrates during the Miocene and Pliocene often have associated fossils
of
          <i>
           C. megalodon
          </i>
          and whales (Purdy, 1996). From such evidence,
paleontologists have surmised a predator-prey relationship of
          <i>
           C. megalodon
          </i>
          on large whales.

           Death of the Megatooth?

          By the end of its reign,
          <i>
           C. megalodon
          </i>
          would have witnessed the
Mediterranean becoming a tributary of the Atlantic, the closing of the
isthmus of Panama, a new genus of hominids on the African savannah called
          <i>
           Homo
          </i>
          , the onset of Arctic glaciation and the returning of the Earth to a
predominantly glacial mode. The decrease in the oceans temperature during
the mid-Pliocene may have spelled the doom of
          <i>
           C. megalodon
          </i>
          . Casey and
Pratts (1985) report that juvenile Great White Sharks have a lower
tolerance to cooler waters and an intolerance to higher temperatures that
may limit them to nursery areas in the North Atlantic. Fossils of
          <i>
           C.
megalodon
          </i>
          are found only in regions that were predominantly warmwater
environments. Perhaps the reduction in ocean temperatures in the
mid-Pliocene, reduced the number of possible nursery sites on the
continental shelf for
          <i>
           C. megalodon
          </i>
          . Another possibility is that their
prey, the great whales, escaped to colder waters where Megatooths could
not follow.  Recent discoveries of fossil baleen whales from the Late
Pliocene in Antarctica, demonstrate that great whales began living in
these areas at that time.

          Reports of giant Great White Sharks up to 10 m long (Long, 1995,
p. 80) in recent times and perhaps the influence of Hollywood (
          <i>
           Jaws III
          </i>
          )
have led some scientists to suggest that Megatooth still lives in the
oceans somewhere. Gilbert Whitley, the late curator of fishes at the
Natural History Museum in Sydney, Australia, wrote (1940, p. 125), Large
teeth belonging to species of White Pointer have been dredged at great
depths in the oceans and indicate that enormous sharks are either still
living or only became extinct fairly recently. A man could stand upright
with ease in the jaws of such a monster which has been calculated to have
measured 80 feet in length. However, no well documented "Megatooth" fossils
have been found younger than 3 mya, but remember paleontologists once
believed that all coelacanths went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous,
65 mya, and it is still alive today!
