       Buried Alive

      by Dr. Jack Cuozzo (click to enlarge). It was taken by the author in Bernifal Cave, one of the caverns in France that is renowned for Neanderthal artifacts. The cave was subsequently closed to the public.
      <em>
       Science News

      was given the opportunity to publish the remarkable photo, but declined. It seems that evidence against the prevailing paradigm of naturalistic origin is selected against. It is buried alive by the scientific establishment. As Cuozzo says, this is natural selection in the most literal sense!

      In 600 BC, under the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar, a Babylonian artist was commissioned to shape reliefs of animals on the structures associated with the Ishtar Gate. Many centuries later German archaeologist Robert Koldewey stumbled upon the blue-glazed brick and that gate was rediscovered in 1899. The animals appear in alternating rows with lions, fierce bulls (rimi or reems in Chaldean), and curious long-necked dragons (sirrush). The lions and bulls would have been present at that time in the Middle East. But, on what creature did the ancient Babylonians model the dragon? (click the depiction to enlarge) Koldewey believed that the sirrush was a portrayal of a real animal and in1918, he proposed that the dinosaur
      <em>
       Iguanodon
      </em>
      was the closest known match to the sirrush. The same word, sirrush, is mentioned in the book of Bel and the Dragon, from the
      <em>
       Apocrypha
      </em>
      . Both the description there and the image on these unearthed walls, which are now displayed in the Berlin Vorderasiatisches Museum, appear to fit a sauropod dinosaur. (Shuker, Karl P.N., The Sirrush of Babylon,
      <em>
       Dragons: A Natural History
      </em>
      , 1995, pp. 70-73.)

      <sup>
       st
      </sup>
      Millennium AD that is part of the Genesis Park collection. The most fascinating element of this vessel is the stylized, scaled dinosaur-like dragon that forms the spout. Dragons form an integral part of Persian mythology and beliefs. The ceremonial undertones of this vessel lead us to believe that it was associated with Zoroastrianism. Several malevolent dragon-like creatures are mentioned at various points in the Zoroastrian scriptures. One such popular dragon myth involves Azi Dahaka  a three-headed Persian dragon that will devour one third of all men and animals at the end of the world.

      Although the Ottoman Empire ruled for over six centuries, there are not many depictions of dinosaurian creatures in their artwork (as compared to Medieval European art). Perhaps dragons were not as common in the eastern European/Middle East theater at that time. The Turkish painting to the left, entitled Procession of the Trade Corporation during the Festival of 1720 in Constantinople is in a surname (or historical album) called
      <i>
       The Surname-I Hmayun
      </i>
      archived at Topkapi Museum of Istanbul. It was written and illustrated under the direction of Abdulcelil Levni (aka Abdulcelil elebi) who was the official Ottoman court painter till he died in 1732. The picture shows the guildsmen, followed by clowns and what seems to be a mechanical three-headed dragon. (Click for an enlargement of the dragon.) Note the similarity to baby sauropods dinosaur. A

       sauropod with multiple heads

      , a condition known as polycephaly, while curious, is hardly unknown among dinosaur reports.

      Up to the 1800s the Dayak peoples of Borneo and Sumatra produced multiple pieces of art depicting long-tailed, long-necked creatures with a headcrest. Some of these animals resemble hadrosaurs. This particular work, housed in the Ethnographical Museum of Budapest, depicts a creature that bears a striking resemblance to a Corythosaurus. It is apparently being hunted by these ancient Indonesian peoples. (Bodrogi, Tibor,
      <em>
       Art of Indonesia
      </em>
      , 1973.)

      Chinese stories and stylized dragon depictions are fairly common. But an unusual beaked dragon statue came up on the antiquities market and is now in the Genesis Park collection. The bronze styling on this artifact suggests it is from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.  A.D. 220). It displays numerous characteristics of the beaked dinosaurs (like the
      <em>
       Oviraptor
      </em>
      depicted alongside for comparison): tridactyl feet configuration, metatarsal stance, scale-like representation all over the body (except for the horn which has a striated pattern), long (albeit slender) tail, elaborate head crest and a long neck. This piece was submitted for industrial X-Ray authentication and the patina was also chemically tested, showing that the artifact was clearly genuine. A beautifully preserved beaked dinosaur mummy (
      <em>
       Edmontosaurus)
      </em>
      was discovered in Alberta, Canada in 2013. The specimen sporteda fleshy crest atop its head (like a rooster). Researchers theorized that the hat-like ornament was brightly colored to allow for identification. This was the first non-bony crest discovered on a dinosaur. It closely matches the look of the Chinese beaked dragon.

      The seated dragon sculpture in cast bronze to the left comes from the Tangy Dynasty and is currently housed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Many more such dinosaur-like Chinese dragon depictions could be considered from this time period, like the painted ceramic dragon to the lower left, identified by the exhibiting museum as Tang Dynasty (618-906 AD)

      About 4,000 years ago, the Hongshan culture in China produced many wonderful jade dragon carvings (along with other clear animal representations). Over time these dragon productions became highly stylized and were especially popular as pendants. Most of these pieces only resemble dragons in a crude sense, but a few of the older dragon statues appear to be reproductions of certain dinosaurs. Noticethe resemblance this jade dragon bears to a small
      <em>
       Protoceratops

      dinosaur. The unusual, red carving on right is part of the Genesis Park collection.

      In the view from above (center) the object reveals a strange curving of the plates, as if the animal had been represented lumbering from side to side. The legs are large and awkward, as if carrying great weight, not at all like those of a lizard. There is also a clear representation of a

      There are many striking similarities between these two depictions. The legs and feet on the artifact clearly fit the sauropods better than any other type of animal. The biggest difference is at the head. Cartilage forming the shape of a frill or ears may be stylized or accurate (since there is no way to know from the skeletons we have today). As for the musculature, the ancient artist draws with stunning realism.
      <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">
       One has to ask where the artist got the model to draw so convincingly the trunk of a sauropod.

      To the far right is displayed the Narmer Palette, which datesback to about 3,100 BC. It is from the ancient Egyptian capital of Hierakonpolis and shows the triumph of King Nar-mer with long necked dragons that appear to be in captivity. Immediately to the right is theTwo Dog Palette from the same period. It is displaying a pair of dinosaur-like creatures along with numerous clear representations of living animals (clearly not drawn to scale).

     <p>
      An Egyptian apotropaic wand (or magical knife) dating from about 1750 BC displays a similar long-necked creature. Made from hippo tusk ivory, this artifact is currently housed in the British Museum. The preponderance of these long-necked depictions in ancient art motivated archaeologists who do not believe men and dinosaurs coexisted to invent a name for this particular creature. It is called a serpopard, supposedly a mosaic of a serpent and a leopard. But for those who believe that man was created in the beginning alongside the great reptiles, these palettes seem to be an attempt to depict a sauropod dinosaur. Note the Four Dogs Palette with the serpopard cut out for clarity.

Scholars now believe this is the work of Demetrius the Topographer, an artist from Alexandria who came to work in Rome. The top portion of this remarkable piece of art is generally believed to depict African animals being hunted by black-skinned warriors. These Ethiopians are pursuing what appears to be some type of dinosaur. The Greek Letters above the reptilian animal in question are KROKODILOPARDALIS, which is literally translated Crocodile-Leopard (apparently identifying an agile reptilian creature). The picture shown here is only a small portion of the massive mosaic. It also contains clear depictions of known animals, including Egyptian crocodiles and hippos. (See Finley,

       The picture above right (click to enlarge) was drawn by North American Anasazi Indians that lived in the area that has now become Utah between 150 B.C. and 1200 A.D. Even noted anti-creationists agree that it resembles a dinosaur and that the brownish film which has hardened over the picture, along with the pitting and weathering, attests to its age. One evolutionist writes, There is a petroglyph in Natural Bridges National Monument that bears a startling resemblance to a dinosaur, specifically a Brontosaurus, with a long tail and neck, small head and all.

Some of these Indian depictions of this rotund animal show tridactyl feet, a long neck and prominent tail held aloft. Above to the right, note the handle on a Mesoamerican pottery object made by Mississippi Caddo Indians. It seems to display a baby dinosaur. This circa 1200 AD artifact is housed at Creation Evidence Museum in Texas (click to enlarge).

      Henry Rowe Schoolcraft was a geologist and Indian agent who wrote extensively about the Sioux Indians. He heard stories about a monstrous creature called Unktehi, something like an ox but much larger, with great horns. Schoolcraft reproduced drawings of several types of Unktehi monsters on birchbark around 1850. These were based upon rock art describing a war party of five canoes crossing Lake Superior that encountered animals resembling giant turtles, snakes, and moose. But some (upper right) clearly look dinosaurian. Sioux Indians further west, when interviewed by ethnologists, described Unktehi as an immense reptile or serpent with legs. He was shaped like a giant scaly snake with feet and a notched backbone or crest like a giant saw and had a heavy spiked tail. Still other

      Indian reports describe Unktehi as a swamp-dwelling creature. Adrienne Mayor, an evolutionist, believes that the Sioux were weaving stories about fossils they encountered (Mayor,

      On the right is shown a photo of one of the curious dinosaur petroglyphs near Middle Mesa at the Wupatki National Park. This particular petroglyph is called Puff the Magic Dragon, and appears to be a depiction of a fire-breathing dinosaur. Though there is no certain way to date such petroglyphs, this carving is believed to be at least several hundred years old.

      On two occasions in the late 1800s, Samuel Hubbard, Curator of Archaeology of the Oakland Museum, visited an area of the Grand Canyon known as the Havasupai Canyon. As an evolutionist, he was amazed to find a petroglyph (carved rock drawing) of an elephant made by Native Americans. But another depiction was cut into the sandstone much more deeply than the elephant. Its height was 11.2 inches, with a neck approximately 5.1 inches in length and a tail of 9.1 inches. Hubbard photographed the petroglyph and eventually placed it in his scientific monograph
      <em>
       Discoveries Relating to Prehistoric Man
      </em>
      (1925, p. 10). What kind of animal is it? Dr. Hubbard believed that he had found an ancient drawing of a dinosaur. He wrote, The fact that some prehistoric man made a pictograph of a dinosaur on the walls of this canyon upsets completely all of our theories regarding the antiquity of man. Facts are stubborn and immutable things. If theories do not square with the facts then the theories must change, the facts remain. (Doheny, E. L.,

      A similar association of an American elephant and dinosaur is presented in the Granby Idol. This queer rock relic was unearthed by W.L. Chalmers near Grand Lake, high in the Colorado Rockies. He found the 66 pound stone (along with various ancient utensils) several feet below the surface while enlarging an irrigation reservoir on his homestead. The stone was made of an exceedingly hard green material, like nothing ever known of in the neighborhood. (Is Pre-Glacial Man Coming Back?

       A fantastic mystery has developed over a set of cave paintings found in the Gorozomzi Hills, 25 miles from Salisbury. For the paintings include a brontosaurus  the 67-foot, 30-ton-like creature scientists believed became extinct millions of years before man appeared on earth. Yet the bushmen who did the paintings ruled Rhodesia from only 1500 BC until a couple of hundred years ago. And the experts agree that the bushmen always painted from life experiences. This belief is borne out by other Gorozomzi Hills cave paintings  accurate representations of the elephant, hippo, buck and giraffe. The mysterious pictures were found by Bevan Parkes, who owns the land the caves are on. Adding to the puzzle of the rock paintings found by Parkes is a drawing of a dancing bear.

      Another African tribe from the Mali region produced a dinosaurian object in the mid-1800s. Our friends at the s8int website note that this is the same time frame when Sir Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur in England. The bronze artifact to the left shows a Dogon tribesman riding a long-necked, long-tailed reptilian creature. The oddly bird-like head with strong jawline and ridged head and neck are reminiscent of certain duck-billed ornithopod dinosaurs like the

      To the left is pictured an Ica Ceremonial Burial Stone from the Nasca culture (100 BC to 800AD) that is carved in a bas relief technique. In 1500s the Spanish Conquistadors brought back stories that there were stones with strange creatures carved on them found in Peru. Some of the stones were even brought back to Spain. The Incan Chronicler Juan de Santa Cruz Pachucuti Lumqui wrote in 1571 about the strange engraved stones in Ica. (See Swift, Dennis,
      <em>
       Secrets of the Ica Stones
      </em>
      , 2006.) Dom Geronomo Cabrera was a Spanish conquistador who settled the area of Ica in 1570.One of his descendants, Dr. Javier Cabrera, saw these stones as a child and began collecting them in the 1960s. He eventually accumulated over 11,000 such stones.Retired from the University of Lima, Dr. Cabrera focused upon validating these finds within the scientific community. Hiscredibility was strengthened by long-necked creatures displayed on pottery in the museum of Lima (lower right).

      Also, of interest is the fact that the skin of many of the carved dinosaurs has rounded, bump-like depictions. Some scientists had pointed to this as evidence that this stone art is not scientifically accurate. However, more recent discoveries of fossilized dinosaur skin and embryos have silenced these same critics. For example, Luis Chiappe and colleagues discussed certain sauropod dinosaur embryos found in South America: The general skin pattern consists of round, non-overlapping, tubercle-like scalesA rosette pattern of scales is present in PVPH-130 (Chiappe, et al., 1998, p. 259).

Both taxa show a round pattern of small polygonal scales, which in some places is interrupted by larger oval tubercles surrounded by the small scales, resulting in rosette-like structures. which also match the most common textures known in dinosaurs.

      Other items of anatomical accuracy that attest to the authenticity of these Ica Stone depictions include the positioning of the tail and legs. Early critics said the Ica Stones were fakes, in part because their tails were sticking out while walking. Paleontologists in the 1960s were confident that dinosaurs dragged their tails. The paleontologists were wrong and the Ica Stones were right.

      Scientists now believe dinosaurs held their massive tails off the ground while walking, because there are no drag marks on dinosaur trackways. The dinosaurs on the Ica Stones are depicted standing upright, rather than with legs splayed out in a lizard-like position. That, according to dinosaur experts, is dead on accurate. The stylizing of animals depicted on the Ica Stones matches those found in the Nascan Lines (monkey with curled tail, hummingbird, and stylized dinosaur). Many of the Ica Stones were been blackened so that the artistic etchings stand out. While some fraudulent Ica Stones have been manufactured in recent years to sell to tourists, a number of the dinosaur stones were found in tomb excavations by experienced archaeologists. Moreover microscopic analysis of the patina (covering the stone surface), copper traces and oxidation in the etching grooves unambiguously distinguishes between the authentic and the recently forged artifacts.

      Not far from the South American Nasca sites are the Moche Indian archaeological locations. These Moche tribes inhabited northern Peru about 100-800 AD. Among the artifacts currently in the Lima museums are the Moche stirrup-spout pots (left). These are their main artistic medium, featuring red &amp; white ceramic pots displaying realistic medical procedures, combative events, musical instruments, plants and animals. Official guides at Perus numerous museums and archaeological sites will tell you that the native cultures depicted only things that they saw in nature.

      The ancient Maya culture, which flourished around the 6th century, is famous for their excellent artwork. Bonampak is a Maya archaeological site in Mexico where there are a number ofwonderful murals, including the remarkable one to the left. It shows the presentation of various war captives to the ruler, Chaan Muan, along with some trophy heads (perhaps brought for sacrificing). In addition to the human heads, the men are carrying an animal head and what looks a lot like a dinosaur head (enlarged in the picture to the right). Both the teeth and the large size make it doubtful that the Maya artist was depicting a lizard or snake.

       In 1945 Waldemar Julsrud, a resident of Acambaro, Mexico who had archaeological experience, discovered clay figurines buried at the foot of El Toro Mountain. Eventually over 33,000 ceramic and stone figurines were found! These range from detailed artwork, to fine musical instruments, to roughly-shaped animal depictions, to monstrous creatures. There are clear similarities to Chupicuaro Cultural artifacts

      (800 BC to 200 AD) found in the area, a culture that Julsrud co-discovered.

      But the authenticity of Julsruds find has been challenged because the huge collection included clear dinosaur figurines.In 1954 the Mexican government sent a team of archaeologists to investigate. In 1955 Charles Hapgood, Professor of Anthropology at the University of New Hampshire, conducted an elaborate investigation including radiometric dating and thermo-luminescence testing by the University of Pennsylvania. Subsequent investigations were conducted by the Mexican government. Thus Julsruds work has undergone considerable scrutiny. The Mexican

      government even imprisoned men for digging up and selling these artifacts on the black market. Moreover, the dinosaurs are modeled in very agile, active poses, fitting well with the latest scientific evidence and lending credence to the artists having actually observed these creatures. Like the Ica Stones, some sauropods are depicted with a distinctive spinal frill. The remains of an ice-age horse (now extinct), the unfossilized skeleton of a woolly mammoth, and a number of ancient human skulls were found at the same location as the ceramic artifacts, validating the antiquity of the site (Hapgood, Charles,
      <em>
       Mystery in Acambaro,
      </em>
      2000, p.82.). Dr. Ivan T. Sanderson was amazed in 1955 to find that there was an accurate representation of a
      <em>
       Brachiosaurus
      </em>
      , almost totally unknown to the general public at that time. Sanderson wrote, This figurine is a very fine, jet-black, polished-looking ware. It is about a foot tall. The point is it is an absolutely perfect representation of
      <em>
       Brachiosaurus
      </em>
      , known only from East Africa and North America. There are a number of outlines of the skeletons in the standard literature but only one fleshed out reconstruction that I have ever seen. This is exactly like it. (Hapgood, p. 85.)

By the turn of the century it had improved considerably but fell far short of what we now know. The Acambaro figurine exhibits knowledge we have gained only in recent decades.No hoaxer could have made this model in the 1940s. In fact, there is a movement in recent years to slenderize the sauropod dinosaurs, suggesting that they were more agile and less plump (much like the Acambaro figures). For example, i

      To the right is an artifact from Tiwanaku, an important Pre-Columbian archaeological site in Bolivia. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important precursors to the Inca Empire. The sculptor depicted a dinosaur-like creature at least 800 years before European scientists discovered dinosaurs. The vase on left was also discovered in the Tiwanaku region. It depicts dueling dinosaurs and is believed to date from 500  1000 A.D. The style closely resembles the Nasca dinosaurian depictions (on the Ica Stones).

      The Ashanti people of Ghana in western Africa are known for their bronze carvings that were used over the centuries as gold weights (used along with a scale in the gold dust trade). Eventually, these little statues became a bit of an art form and many accurately depict various African animals. The curious gold weight to the left dates back to the 1800s and is now part of the Penn Museum collection (Image #AF2478 commissioned by Genesis Park). It was unidentified initially, despite diligent search in the animal kingdom. (Plass, Margaret,
      <em>

      Curiously enough, it looks like a stylized version of a sauropod, the fossilized bones of which were actually found in Thailand. Notice the birds perched on the back of the dragon, much as we see them do today on the back of a hippo. A similar motif is seen in a Viet incense burner to the right.

      Deep in the jungles of Cambodia are ornate temples and palaces from the Khmer civilization. One such temple, Ta Prohm, abounds with stone statues and reliefs. Almost every square inch of the gray sandstone is covered with ornate, detailed carvings. These depict familiar animals like monkeys, deer, water buffalo, parrots, and lizards. However, one column contains an intricate carving of a stegosaur-like creature. But how could artisans decorating an 800 year old Buddhist temple know what a dinosaur looked like? Western science only began assembling dinosaurs skeletons in the past two centuries. (Pictures are courtesy of Don Patton.)

      The slaying of a ferocious dragon by St. George is an extremely common motif in medieval art. Various European artists interpreted the dragon differently, depending on local knowledge and lore. A wonderful medieval depiction is seen at the Palau de La Generalitat in Barcelona Spain. St. Georges Chapel contains an altar cloth illustrating St. Georges slaying of a dragon. The depiction bears an amazing likeness to the
      <em>

      , a semi-aquatic reptile (comparison below). Notice the correct-size, the crocodilian body style, and the fascinating long, curved teeth at the front of the jaw that gives way to finer dentition towards the back.

      Yet another interpretation of St. George slaying the dragon is found in the Latin Book of Hours c. 1450 AD which is illuminated by the Master of Jean Chevrot and currently housed at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum (right). Notice the Masters attention to detail (click to enlarge), as seen in Georges armor, the birds in the sky, and the dragons genitals. The Fitzwilliam Museum contains another portrayal (left) of St. George destroying the dragon (probably by Bruges) from a Latin Book of Hours c. 1490 AD. This colorful work from the Flemish School portrays a remarkably dinosaur-like dragon.

       Some of the beautiful French chateaus built at the close of the Middle Ages and early 1500s have dramatic dragon illustrations carved into their walls, ceilings, and furniture. These include Chteau de Chambord, Chteau de Blois, and Chteau Azay-le-Rideau.

      Called salamanders, based on a legendary salamander that could survive fire, they became especially popular decorative elements on construction during the reign of Francis I. Often they are portrayed actually as a fire-breathing dragon, like the biblical Leviathan. Note the similarities among the dragons and their resemblance to dinosaurs like Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus. A number of household furnishings also depict this dragon, like the antique French pot below to the right. A tapestry at Chteau de Blois portrays a dragon (and its baby) with gnarly horns on its head that are reminiscent of the dinosaur

      In Rome there is similar artwork on the outside at the Church of St. Louis of the French. This served for many years as the national church of France in Rome and was completed in the 1580s. Notice on the dragon artwork (to the left) the long neck, tridactyl feet, long tail, neck frill, the scales, and especially the dinosaurian-looking legs. They drop down straight, rather than being splayed out parallel to the ground like a lizards legs. Though exposed to the elements on the exterior of the church, the detailed work has been remarkably well preserved over nearly five centuries! Click to enlarge this amazing dragon carving.

      In 1496 the Bishop of Carlisle, Richard Bell, was buried in Carlisle Cathedral in far northern England, near the Scottish border. The tomb (see right) is inlaid with brass, having various animals engraved upon it. Although worn by the countless feet that walked over it since the Middle Ages, a particular depiction is intriguing in its similarity to a sauropod dinosaur. It appears to be two long-necked dinosaurs with necks entangled like the Egyptian Hierakonpolis dragon depictions mentioned above (perhaps an amorous posture). The long tails stick out straight like an
      <em>
       Apatosaurus
      </em>
      and of one (maybe the male) sports spikes at the end. Amongst the birds, dog, eel, bat, fox, etc. depicted around the tomb, this compelling representation of two long-necked creatures should be considered evidence that man and dinosaurs co-existed.
