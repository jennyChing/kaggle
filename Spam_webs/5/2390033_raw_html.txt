         The Holocaust refers to the systematic murder of more than six million Jews orchestrated by Adolph Hitler and the National Socialist (Nazi) Party in Europe during World War II(1933-1945) during which the Jewish Genocide shocked the world and questioned the human fibre of German authority becoming a license for other colonial countries. The reasons simply known as the preservation of the pure German Nordic race by elimination of the midgets and cycle owners (Jews) with twisted noses and ape-like features(dark haired) were feared and suspiciously looked down upon as lesser humans due to the strange cuisine and religious rituals they practised. Hitlers propaganda leading everyone to believe (including Jews) who represented the economy, media, arts and business services, that Jews were responsible for the misfortunes suffered during the fall of the Weimar government through Nuremberg Laws leading to synagogue(the place of worship for a Jewish congregation) burnings , pogroms(Organized persecution of an ethnic group) and lynched by the espionage brutally in camps, ghettos and pits. The reasons were fear of domination by the scholarly and alien mongrel class of people who followed a distant religion and spoke an unknown language(Hebrew) . This contradicts the theory of considering them evil and powerful where in the past they were wiped out for conflicting reasons.

         Jews today have taken over marketing, militia, medicinal, technological, media, industrial, cinema challenges etc. and continue to face the worlds envy through unexplained success stories given their inglorious past and vermin like repression all over Europe , Soviet Union , Asia before the 20th century. They have transcended all barriers of indifference and hatred and continue to represent in majority number sectors of finance, law, medicine etc. People do not like the stats for obvious reasons as a race thats been subjugated to massacres every 21 years in different places and eras continues not only to exist but with money bags and high portfolios. The reasons are complex yet identifiable. Jews were outlawed from owning land and property in historic times and hence resorted to money lending, business trades, middle class bearing and liberating philosophies which is why we see no farmers today and no poverty either. They are few yet powerful because the misery meted out to them in the past, in time ,turned out to be their most precious possession. Also, history is testament to the cause of the literate masses of the chosen few in times of universal illiteracy where Jews sincerely attended synagogues regularly when their second pillar (temple of Jerusalem) was destroyed and their only resistance was through unfailing faith. This gave them an upper hand, secured jobs killed the need to convert for economic reasons , and they continued to flourish disproportionately (given their small numbers) invoking the worlds contempt and jealousy furthermore.

         The holy book of Islam has been quite a force in deciding the attitude of Muslims towards the Jews and absence of questioning its confusing stand on the chosen few, its led to universal animosity between the children of Allah and Abraham. Quran in some sections maintains Muhammad and his peaceful social contract with the Jews of medina and later a war is waged and the three Jewish tribes of Arabia are expelled for denying prophet hood to Muhammad and called traitors, perfidious and worldliness. What is strange is the fanatic extremities to which the Quran was interpreted and the ruthless treatment of non-Muslims (including Jews) were subjected to for denying Islamic conversion and the right to maintain ones own faith. Dispute was never about the Jewish temple in Jerusalem since the prophet bowed down before it only once which did not make it a religious property of Muslims as that was to represent amicability between medina dwellers (Jews) and the hospitality they offered to Muhammad but misinterpretation led to a prejudiced world belief. Classical commentators viewed Muhammads struggle with Jews as a minor episode in his career, but this has changed in modern times due to external influences. This became the cause of hatred all around the world within Muslim communities as failure to realize the mortality of a prophet and his whimsical declaration posed a threat to Jews from times immemorial and intensified public opinion(uncontrolled Muslim population) around the globe. Jewish people were viewed as a cult posing threat to world religions which explains the anger. A deeper understanding was never strived for as religion became law and law became faith.

         Torah consists of the foundational narrative of the Jewish people, their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of religious obligations and civil laws (halakha). The 613 commandments of the torah(laws of Moses)mostly include morals and self-righteous laws that other people find in contradiction due to the status quo. Jews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jews have believed that right action (as opposed to right belief) is the way for a person to atone for ones sins and that explains the situation in Israel. They seem to be claiming back what they feel is rightfully theirs through this understanding of higher moral from the commandments in the Torah as a way to rightly possess what was denied to them and to ease their conscious into committing a sin just because over the years they have been paying for sins they never committed. A movement of world Jewry that arose late in the 19th century with the aim of creating a Jewish state in Palestine(Zionism) also sprouted from the Jewish cults retaliation to years of suppression, subjugation and discrimination. The holy place of Jewish source being Palestine, the concentrated power in the hands of the Jews and the power monopoly was mere self glorification keeping in with the laws of the Torah. The world therefore hates them for setting two precedents, one, they justify the wrong they do religiously, and two, the general moral standing of Jews that sends the others on a guilt trip since no one wants to be reminded of ones sins.

         A belief or sentiment shared by most people or the voice of the people or a belief of the majority is popular public opinion. Does condemning a particular race of people for mutually inclusive reasons become a fact just because it is done by more people (majority) or should causes be contemplated even then? The medias role in portraying a negative picture of the Jews is a very strong factor determining mass hatred and global views. The traditional role of the media has always been to presents facts, issues and statistics sans judgements. To present the problem and not the opinion is what is required and expected as with power comes responsibility. The politicising of news in general has added fuel to fire and even if someone is ignorant enough not to know what is happening, he/she will hate Jews not because of the trouble brewing but by virtue of the fact that they are Jews. The most hilarious confessions include viewing Jewish minority as both inferior yet dominating, primitive yet successful, nasty but righteous, alien in existence yet the chosen few, Internationally supported yet negatively viewed etc. which are nothing but beautiful contradictions , made by people who neither know who a Jew is nor the cause of the problem which is merely a resurfacing phenomenon but with turned tables.

         Human psychology testifies how we perceive success in terms of collective aspects. For example the world thinks Indians make the best engineers and doctors, Germans make the best automobile and heavy machinery and Spaniards the best wine! Jews on the other hand have surpassed all clich barriers and are ruling everywhere. 52% of non-fiction Pulitzer prize winners are Jews, Nobel awardees are Jews, two Jewish doctors vanquished polio disease and removed our fears forever, garment industry with names like Levis, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan ,our computers with names like Dell, software from giants like Oracle, search engines like Google, and social media like Facebook, share the legacy just as Intel and Qualcomm chips and technologies are inside so many of our computers and cell phones. The three largest broadcasting networks  ABC, NBC and CBS were built from the efforts of two visionary Jewish entrepreneurs, David Sarnoff and William Paley. Sarnoff in particular saw the potential to convert wireless, then used for ship-to-shore communications, into a broadcast medium distributed via a network.. In medicine, law, science, politics and education, the leadership, innovation and hard work of Jews have benefited us all. And if they have been successful as entrepreneurs, disproportionately represented among the members of the Forbes 400 and as CEOs of the Fortune 500, that achievement is outstripped by the fact that in philanthropy  particularly for secular causes such as education, medicine and the arts  Jews are even more philanthropic than they are wealthy. Not too hard to imagine why the world hates Judaic people when 9 out of 10 in every scenario are rolling in money and good hearted too ! Global perceptions are defied through these statistics and people do not like what they do not understand because Jews are supposed to be dying, eradicated and suffering like holocaust instead they are flourishing, prospering and invoking sympathies at the same time which becomes quite a lot to digest for Anti-Semites and Anti-Zionists.

         Loan Sharks or Usurers are people practicing Usury , a practice of making unethical or immoral monetary loans intended to unfairly enrich the lender. A loan may be considered usurious because of excessive or abusive interest rates or other factors, but according to some dictionaries, simply charging any interest at all can be considered usury. The Torah (the first of three divisions of the Hebrew Scriptures comprising the first five books of the Hebrew Bible considered as a unit) and Talmud (the collection of ancient rabbinic writings on Jewish law and tradition (the Mishna and the Gemara) that constitute the basis of religious authority in Orthodox Judaism) are a cause of dispute even today. They suggest that charging interest to Hebrew people is an offense but not if the same is done to non-Jews given that Jews comprised of the merchant class. In the Victorian era and times before, Jews were looked down upon as money mongrels and stiff necked usurers who bribed innocent Christians before their ships would arrive at the docks. In medieval times it was universally condemned as a heinous and immoral act by the Christian church. The act of usury was deemed a mortal sin, and its practitioners path of greed was understood to end in eternal damnation in Hell. The idea of profiteering from someone elses need , possibly desperate , for money was believed by medieval Christianity to be the antithesis of compassion, generosity, and charity. Christ was upheld as an example of poverty, non-materialism, and abstinence. Common wisdom asserted that those who had surplus money to lend in the first place were obsessed with greed and avarice and needed no more  certainly by usury  for their coffers. And making money for doing absolutely nothing (except having the money available) went against Christian medieval understandings of decency, justice, honest work, and morality. In essence, usury was perceived as a crass system of exponential exploitation by which the already wealthy could get increasingly wealthier for little more than the fact of their wealth in the first place and isolated the Christians from the Jews that manifests itself in Shakespeares plays where a Jew is always the devil and continues even today.

         The obvious need not be stated-the Jews in Israel are inhuman, the Arabs are the victims, power monopoly and genocide of the Arab race from Palestine and their extreme control of West Bank which is an open Prison are evidence of a situation that needs to be resolved. But the causes are deep rooted and less known. Jews have lived in this land continuously from the time of its original conquest by Joshua more than 3200 years ago until the present day, though Jews were not always in political control of the land, and Jews were not always the majority of the lands population. Living outside of Israel is viewed as an unnatural state for a Jew. The world outside of Israel is often referred to as galut, which is usually translated as diaspora (dispersion), but a more literal translation would be exile or captivity. In the late 1800s, Theodor Herzl and Chaim Weizmann founded Zionism, a political movement dedicated to the creation of a Jewish state. They saw a state of Israel as a necessary refuge for Jewish victims of oppression, especially in Russia, where pogroms were decimating the Jewish population. The Holocaust brought the need for a Jewish homeland into sharp focus for both Jews and for the rest of the world. The Jews who tried to flee Nazi Germany were often turned back due to immigration limitations at the borders of every country, including the United States, Britain and Palestine. Many of those who were sent back to Germany ended up in death camps where they were systematically murdered. The newly-founded United Nations, which developed a partition plan dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab portions tried to resolve the problem of control. The plan was ratified in November 1947. The mandate expired on May 14, 1948 and British troops pulled out of Palestine. The Jews of Palestine promptly declared the creation of the State of Israel, which was recognized by several Western countries immediately. However, the surrounding Arab nations did not recognize the validity of Israel and invaded, claiming that they were filling a vacuum created by the termination of the mandate and the absence of any legal authority to replace it. The Arabs fought a year-long war to drive the Jews out. Miraculously, the new state of Israel won this war, as well as every subsequent Arab-Israeli war, gaining territory every time the Arabs attacked them. Now the world stands shocked as one race tries to drive another out and they become the persecutors and villains of the 21st century contributing to their hatred furthermore.

         If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence but if the Jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel. There has been a growing call around the world for the United States to stop its blind support of Israel. Arab academics have even begun to conjure up an image of a cowering United States being the lackey of Israel. The possible explanation could be that Jews control the vast majority of wealth in the Western World. All the banks and media companies in America, from health care to the garment industries and law firms are predominantly Jewish with their representation or their stamp. Americans are careful in procuring the best technological and ammunition deals with Israel as the last thing they would want is the Arabs running to the Soviets for support and therefore it is a hush hush affair. Also a great deal of Jews(one of the largest minorities) resides in the US and the new heights of success US has witnessed is their gift to them which they maybe feel obligated to respond to through their unfailing support to Israel and their cause. Israel is a useful country to them with resources, important people, great beneficial consequences and the latest technology in all fields which is why the superpower feels the need to look after its own interests before others leading to provocation in the eastern world who now say America had no right to intervene even in Afghanistan and Iraq with its screwed up notion of corrective intervention. Any country, race or ethnic group that is rightly condemned by most of the world for terrorizing its populace with a powerful giants support is bound to make them hate it even more which is what makes this issue so delectable

         Jewish deicide is a belief that places the responsibility for the death of Jesus on the Jewish people as a whole. The implications of this have been huge- the accusation was frequently stated, and used to exhort violence against the Jews. Many of the most violent pogroms (attacks against Jews), were as a result of a local priest preaching on this theme at Easter. Thus this claim can be linked to numerous persecutions of the Jews. The Dominicans were very active in preaching on this accusation  and the murder of 4000 people in Lisbon in 1506AD is directly attributed to preaching by Dominican priests. The Christian Bible says the Romans killed Jesus, though Jews are mentioned as accomplices (claims that Jews killed Jesus came several hundred years later). How come the accomplices are persecuted and there isnt an anti-Roman movement through history? Jesus himself said, Forgive them [i.e., the Jews], for they know not what they do. The Second Vatican Council in 1963 officially exonerated the Jews as the killers of Jesus. Neither statement of Christian belief lessened anti-Semitism, because Christianity records the historical fact that the Jews crucified Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory. Each individual Jew, as the Bible teaches, shares in the Corporate Guilt of the murder of Jesus Christ. Thus the Jews, both individually and corporately, must repent of their sins. The largest world faith is Christianity followed by Islam and unaffiliated faiths and all three hate Jews for reasons already stated and thats why most of the world hates them. This is the biggest and most revealing cause of Anti-Semitism which to some extent exposes the irrational and theocratic undercurrents in both Christian and Islamic faiths.

            11. For the same reason why the British Empire is hated; they created a religion, which is Jewish supremacy and that branched out into 2 more abrahamic religions which are still fucking everything up.

            2 Jew Dr.s fucked me up and are trying to cover it up. I believe they even tried to take me out with a drug combination that my pharmacist brought to my attention, when i tried to fill my prescription the computer there said cant prescribe together because together they are highly toxic. And my disability lawyer is Jew ,disability judge is a Jew. I tried to sue, guess what? Jews wont sew Jews. So i did some research. Jews are destroying america, they are more of a threat than ISIS, and Al Qaeda combined. Almost all media is controlled  by dirty Jews, They are brainwashing american citizens,(american peasants), and lining the pockets of our government officials,  and our troops are dying fighting their holy war. I now agree death to Israel is the only solution. The JEWS may have got away with killing Jesus, they fucked when they tried to kill me, you cant kill the devil, they will meet the business end of my horns before my health fails me&gt; thats a promise!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                They have been the victims only to those actions provoked by their sadistic actions. It seems you are neither educated nor observant. The probability that a single people be kicked out of nations roughly 109 times without probable and justifiable cause is nearly negligible. Many of the greatest minds of all times were aware of their characteristic seemingly pathological anti-social behavior.
               </p>
               <p>
                Their victimization is largely overstated (they love hyperbole, historically).

                Not all old jews were educated.  Kike was a derogatory name for an uneducated jew given to them by their own people. Their obsession for education has come hand in hand with their need for their survive. You call me a Kike my friend then I call you a Kike as well.

              Why have the Jews been kicked out of 88 different countries worldwide, why did they (NOT) want them colonising America, to stop it being destroyed, Jews build Nothing they don,t work, they destroy like parasites do. Did the Jew do Uss Liberty, study that, Did they do 9-11? Study that, who stupidly let them back to England? Crommel who took over Englands banks study that, who faked the holocaust study that. Ooh the poor Jew gets blamed for everything. Thats because they did it, its called the TRUTH. Do you actually know that word? What it means,
              <br/>
              Truth.
              <br/>
              1)The true or factual state of the matter.
              <br/>
              2)Conformity with fact or reality, verity.
              <br/>
              3)A verified or undesputable fact
              <br/>
              4)The state or chatachter of being true
              <br/>
              5)Actuality or actual excistence.
              <br/>
              6)An obvious or accepted fact; Truism, Platitude.

            Poorly written and grossly inaccurate. Redcross records clearly show that only 271,000 jews died in Germany, mostly from Typhus. Not a single autopsy shows evidence of gassing. Ground penetrating radar shows no masses of bodies underground. Cremation takes 4 hours per body and would be impossible to burn more than 60,000 bodies in the timeframe, not to mention aerial photography from allied forces never showed smoke coming from the work camps. Wake up people. The holocaust is a giant lie. Jews are hated for being liars that feed off the rest of humanity (whom they refer to as Goyim or cattle)

              Please read more history books. Read translated books from different countries. Read the meticulous records the Nazi Regime kept of their progress of racial cleansing. Please dont publicly state that 2% of the worlds population has tricked many of the countries in the world that the Holocaust was the genocide of 6 million Jewish people. Were the other 5 million gypsys, gays, mentally disabled, etc. massacred a lie as well? Did they also lie to the world as minorities and trick billions of people into believing their far tales? Also, Goyim is from the Old Testament and means the nations referring to the other nations that are not of the Jewish faith. Not cattle.

                Wow. How blatantly inaccurate you are. There are no Nazi records of racial cleansing. If you wish to refute, point me in the direction of this evidence. The rest of your drivel is built upon fallacies aplenty.
               </p>
               <p>
                First, the fallacy of personal incredulity; you cannot possibly imagine how such a small group could have perpetuated an untruth so large, that it couldnt possibly be so. In fact, it has been done many times in the past, even relatively recently. The Katyn Forest Massacre is one instance.
               </p>
               <p>
                Next, you create a false equivalence.
                <br/>
                Those groups you described would likely not know what the Jews had purported to be a lie, due to either comparatively less large group cohesion (Gypsies) or to the lack of personal connection found in superficial characteristic categorizations (gays, disabled, etc.).
               </p>
               <p>
                Lastly, you finish with an etymological fallacy. Goyim historically is translated to mean what you have said. But recently, it has an undoubted pejorative connotation. Even further, because many people (even Jews themselves) associate the word with cattle, it has evolved to mean largely such.
               </p>
               <p>
                I assume you are a Jew. The characteristic rhetorical style is comparatively uncanny; using hyperbole to the extent of oblivion, attacking strawmen, and appealing to emotion (usually guilt) to divert and deflect.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sooner or later, the White Western nations are going to wise up and realize the utter affliction that is the Jew within their society. It is beyond lamentable that we must constantly relearn this lesson.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I await your cries of racism, bigotry, or even better anti-Semitism. The Jew is nothing more than a sadistic parasite, and he would be nothing without his gracious host, the White man.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, the Nobel prizes as a whole are a joke. The fact that Jews use their high percentage of winners as intellectual superiority is laughable. Although what can you do when you have hardly contributed any great invention?
               </p>

                    i doubt you even know that the hebrew word goy, means nation. when jews use that word, they are merely saying, that you are of a different nation and have different beliefs.

                   <p>
                    The term goy translates to a single nation or people, simply in reference to the nations of the world (Goyim being plural). Contextually it is often used today to refer to members of a nation that isnt Jewish. Even Jewish writings, however, refer to the Jewish nation as a goy as well.

                  why no records? because the nazis destroyed as much evidence of their crimes as possible, by setting fire to the camps. however camp survivors have written accounts of the atrocities that went on there.

                  This guy clearly has an inferiority complex.    if Jews have conspired to take over positions of power, their success in doing so is clearly not from lack of talent, and surely such talent  explains how they have excelled in  so many areas.    if you deny that its the quest of every group  to gain power and influence, then clearly you dont understand human nature. The fact that you resent the Jews for  succeeding in doing so only indicates your personal failure and inferiority complex as a human Being.

                    Furthermore, those who deny the Holocaust, should at least admit their own stupidity.  Why would Poland, a country that doesnt necessarily love Jews, conspie to admit that the Holocaust happened and why would it help Jews recreate the concentration camp you can still visit today in Warsaw?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Ehat about the Immaculate records kept by the Germans about their own atrocities, which they now repent for. Are you saying the Jews are so powerful, and that gentiles are such  big pansies, that Jews  brainwashed them into having false memories?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    did actually Jews around the world who survived the Holocaust and still have tattooed numbers on their arms today, go to a tattoo parlor and mass as part of some conspiracy?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    anyone who denies the Holocaust goes into the same heading and reality distorting category as people who say Obama was born in Kenya.  and another thing, when you have to lie to validate your hate, perhaps you should Explorer for honestly your own insecurities that youre afraid to admit are the real reason for your hatred.  for example, I hate pedophiles because they exploit and harm children.  that is factually accurate and all that I need to say. if I start saying they have horns, they drink blood, or create other mythology to justify my hatred, it starts to sound like my hatred is based on superstition,l and misunderstanding, as is the case with most anti Semitism.

                  Holy fucking Christ, you vapid douchebag. Do you ever not speak bullshit? Ive ignored most of the Nazis in the comments.  But you, you brilliant asshole, have caught my attention. Your attempts at trying to pass off conjecture and nonsense as evidence is abhorrent. The part of that steaming pile of horse shit that you typed that I despise the most is where you try to defend your ravings by accusing Talkwme of using fallacies and not having evidence. The sure mark of a pseudo-intellectual is an inordinate amount of time spent trying to discredit anothers argument with talk of fallacies  and  evidence  while committing numerous of his own and having no evidence. Instead of shoring up your own position, you desperately attack his.  Im going to posit an argument, with evidence,  since you seem to need spoon feeding, but I fully expect your retort to involve the corrupt Jew media and academia and what not. Its easy to justify your hate and defend your argument if you can convince yourself that everyone else is out to get you. If the Holocaust was a hoax, then why  did the Nazis never deny the holocaust? They tried to distance themselves, change their identities, say they were just following orders, but they never denied that the holocaust happened.  Lets take Rudolph Hoss, he was the commandant in charge of Auschwitz from 1940 to 1943. He was captured in 1946, disguised as a farmer called Franz Lang. He cooperated fully with the allies, telling them all he knew. You might, in this moment, be thinking he was coerced  so in an attempt to head that train off at the pass, Ill say that a psychologist had examined Hoss and determined that he was apathetic. He had resigned himself to his fate. Here are his exact words:
                  <br/>
                  I commanded Auschwitz until 1 December 1943, and estimate that at least 2,500,000 victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease, making a total dead of about 3,000,000. This figure represents about 70% or 80% of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners, the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries.(Hoss affidavit for his Nuremberg trial).  Im also including a picture of hours affidavit. The link to  records in the national archives doesnt seem to be working, but Im sure you get the point.  So I ask you, if the Holocaust didnt happen, or the numbers are wrong or what have you, then why did the Nazis themselves disagree with you? As for a list of inventions by Jewish people; Lasers, Mass-Energy equivalence, Capitalism, and vaccines for Cholera, the plague and polio. Are those inventions great enough? And if youre wondering if Im one of them  I feel like I should clarify that Im Irish and a Catholic.

                    The burden of proof lies on the individual making the claim of the existence of the event, not the skeptic. You must first understand this. The statistical determination of significance requires an adequate amount of physical evidence, and in the case of the Holocaust, the amount that exists or that has been provided is patently miniscule. Well-known Holocaust scholar Robert Van Pelt has said somewhat recently, Ninety-nine percent of what we know [about the Holocaust] we do not have the physical evidence to prove. It has become part of our inherited knowledge.
                    <br/>
                    The probability that such an event of a massive scale occurred (regarding 6 million purposeful exterminations) with practically no physical trace left to verify its reality is so tiny that any other hypothesis paired with parallel statistical and evidential circumstances would be discarded without hesitation. This did not occur because it was never examined under scrutiny while divorced from the enormous mass of emotion in which problematic bias is borne.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Regarding Rudolf Hoess and his testimony/affidavit, this is a point of great contention as many would argue that it was coerced under duress after incredible amounts of torture. Many historians today now admit that he cannot be considered to be a reliable witness. Further, there are aspects of his confession that contradict facts and even parts that are absolute fiction, which only further alludes to the probable case that he was admitting to whatever necessary to avoid further harm.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As you yourself know, Hoess claimed that 3,000,000 prisoners perished in Aushwitz. This is a claim that is unanimously accepted to be false. The officially accepted figure is now 1.1 million as it is even posted on the plaque located at the Auschwitz museum. This large difference in number is extremely odd, given that the Germans are famously meticulous record-keepers, and undoubtedly further implies a statement made under duress in the kangaroo court of the Nuremberg Trials.

                    The burden of proof lies on the individual making the claim of the existence of the event, not the skeptic. You must first understand this. The statistical determination of significance requires an adequate amount of physical evidence, and in the case of the Holocaust, the amount that exists or that has been provided is patently miniscule. Well-known Holocaust scholar Robert Van Pelt has said somewhat recently, Ninety-nine percent of what we know [about the Holocaust] we do not have the physical evidence to prove. It has become part of our inherited knowledge.
                    <br/>
                    The probability that such an event of a massive scale occurred (regarding 6 million purposeful exterminations) with practically no physical trace left to verify its reality is so tiny that any other hypothesis paired with parallel statistical and evidential circumstances would be discarded without hesitation. This did not occur because it was never examined under scrutiny while divorced from the enormous mass of emotion in which problematic bias is borne.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Regarding Rudolf Hoess and his testimony/affidavit, this is a point of great contention as many would argue that it was coerced under duress after incredible amounts of torture. Many historians today now admit that he cannot be considered to be a reliable witness. Further, there are aspects of his confession that contradict facts and even parts that are absolute fiction, which only further alludes to the probable case that he was admitting to whatever necessary to avoid further harm.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As you yourself know, Hoess claimed that 3,000,000 prisoners perished in Aushwitz. This is a claim that is unanimously accepted to be false. The officially accepted figure is now 1.1 million as it is even posted on the plaque located at the Auschwitz museum. This large difference in number is exceptionally odd, given that the Germans were famously meticulous record-keepers, and this further implies the statement was made under duress in the kangaroo court of the Nuremberg Trials.

                  For current deffinitions, from wiki:
                  <br/>
                  Goy: English, Hebrew: regular plural goyim is the standard Hebrew biblical term for a nation, including that of Israel. Long before Roman times it had also acquired the meaning of someone who is not Jewish. The latter is also its meaning in Yiddish. It is also used to refer to individuals from non-Jewish
                  <br/>
                  religious or ethnic groups; when used in this way in English, it occasionally has pejorative connotations. However, many people do not see the term goy as any more or less offensive than the term gentile. However, to avoid any perceived offensive connotations, writers may use the better-known
                  <br/>
                  English terms gentile or non-Jew.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To evidence,
                  <br/>
                  1
                  <br/>
                  Jews (5 of the First Regulations of the German Citizenship Law of 14 November 1935, Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 1333) are prohibited from acquiring, possessing, and carrying firearms and ammunition, as well as truncheons or stabbing weapons. Those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over to the local police authority.
                  <br/>
                  2
                  <br/>
                  Firearms and ammunition found in a Jews possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation.
                  <br/>
                  3
                  <br/>
                  The Minister of the Interior may make exceptions to the Prohibition in 1 for Jews who are foreign nationals. He can entrust other authorities with this power.
                  <br/>
                  4
                  <br/>
                  Whoever willfully or negligently violates the provisions of 1 will be punished with imprisonment and a fine. In especially severe cases of deliberate violations, the punishment is imprisonment in a penitentiary for up to five years.
                  <br/>
                  5
                  <br/>
                  For the implementation of this regulation, the Minister of the Interior waives the necessary legal and administrative provisions.
                  <br/>
                  6
                  <br/>
                  This regulation is valid in the state of Austria and in the Sudeten-German districts.

                  Do you suggest Jews wrote that law? Do you suggest they created the mechanism of their own demise?

                  You say families and friends of other victims would not know of their fate. Talk to some. Read a book, read as many as you can by the ones who survived, Jews or not, and then suggest theyre ALL making it up. I dare you to.

                  And I await your cries of racism, bigotry, or even better anti-Semitism. The Jew is nothing more than a sadistic parasite, and he would be nothing without his gracious host, the White man.
                  <br/>
                  Your comment speaks for itself, the very deffinition of a racist bigot, ignorantly displaying (and not even realizing the incredible hipocracy and oxymoronic nature of your two sentences) the phobia of racism itself.
                  <br/>
                  You just described who you are. No one else has to do that for you. Now go look in the mirror and scream racist as much as you want, your proud of it and it shows, you even upvoted yourself.

                The holocaust was an exploitation of ww2 based on lies to justify Israel. The simple fact that questioning the holocaust is illegal is many countries proves this. A true history has nothing to hide from objective facts and the scrutainy of questioning minds. Only a lie would supress the alternative to continue its exisitance as a lie. The only conclusion is that zionists are behind this lie.

                  Did you happen to see the swimming pool at Auschwitz? The theatres, or the fake gas chambers changed (After) the war, or maybe they don,t show that on the propaganda tour? The walls that were demolished to make it one chamber? The chimney 100 yards from the so called gas chambers, the fact that Zyklon B only works &amp; certain temperatures and was simply used to delouse the inmates! Or you simply another paid Kike to continue Rothschilds Bald faced lies? The proof is undeniable. Whats your motives to hide Bolshevik, atrocities gain millions of dirty Israheli terrorist $ The holodomor was the real holocaust. All wars instigated by Rothschild &amp; the shabez Goi!

              this is a very biased argument. i would recommend you read a book about the holocaust and what camp survivors went through. a good book is the yellow star

              So you have been to Germany and personally visited the camps, the survivors, did researched, taken college courses on the Holocaust, and went to different Holocaust museums and on your own came up with the statement that it never happened? So all the speeches given by Hitler exampling what he was doing and countless Nazis confesses were lies as well? 6 million Jews just disappeared on a magic spaceship according to you?? Are you brain dead or were you dropped a few times as a child, please read a book for your sake or attempt to THINK before you SPEAK.

                Not very likely. The source used to work out that number (The American Jewish Year Book) is biased.

                The total number of Jews in the world actually increased, despite numbers of Christians decreasing.
               </p>
               <p>
                There was definitely a Jewish extermination program in Nazi Germany, but its very unlikely that more than 1 million or so died. The 6 million number also ignores the Jews that emigrated willingly or were deported.

              About 500,000 holocaust victims were German Jews in Germany.  The remaining 5,500,000 or so were living in other parts of Europe that the Nazis invaded.  The Nazis killed more non-Jews than Jews.  They killed about 6 million people in Poland and only 3 million of those were Jews who lived in Poland, they also killed about 3 million non-Jewish Poles during the invasion.  When they invaded the Soviet Union they killed about 13.5 million civilians through both direct violence and starvation as they blockaded Russian cities.  Of those 13.5 million civilians, only about 2.5 million were Jews living in the USSR who were killed in the death camps.  The remaining 500,000 or so Jews killed in the death camps were living in other parts of German occupied Europe.  The Nazis also killed many more non-Jewish civilians in the parts of Europe they invaded.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look at what the Nazis did to the Christian and atheist civilians living in Poland and the USSR, why is it so hard to believe that they would be just as inhumane to the Jews?

              expounder, your ignorance is astounding.  I have been to Auschwitz and saw with my own eyes the site of the horrible atrocities.  I have been to Baba Yar, the monument to the slain Jews in Ukraine.  The ground surrounding the monument continues to bubble and shift to this day because of the decay that is happening under the earthBaba Yar is a MASS GRAVE of JEWS who were slaughtered in WWII. By Germans when the Ukrainians gave over their Jews thinking that the act would allow them to save themselves from the Germans.  I actually saw the ground shifting there.   How anyone in this day and age can deny the holocaust and the numbers that were slain by the Germans and the countries sympathetic to the Nazis, is just impossible to understand.  Btw, cremation was NOT what took place it was incineration with accelerants.  GAS makes everything burn faster.  There are countless accounts and PHOTOGRAPHS of the smoke that rose from the camps.  Before you spew your ignorance about like a dolt, you might want to do some real research, from real sources.  Ones that are endorsed by the Neo Nazis, are probably not the most reliable on these matters.  Just sayin.   And most of the Nazi murders were committed in camps OUTSIDE of Germany they shipped them to Poland etc. so of course the red cross records would say that only a small number died in Germany.  I am normally a very placid person, but such blatant idiocy, and lack of desire to learn the truth, really rile me up.  Those who do not learn history, are doomed to repeat it.

                Oh so youve been to Auschwitz? Unless you were there in the 40s you have no idea what truly happened. You saw what you wanted to see, or what you were told you were seeing. The Soviets were the ones who concocted the so-called atrocities of the Germans to cover up their own atrocities. The Soviets murdered 60 million of their own people, ten times more than the Germans were said to have done. Yet Hitler is histories greatest demon? Why is that? Just remember the victors write the history books.

Please take a deep breath, read reliable data, and when you stop denying that which has clearly happened, youll be welcome back on planet earth. Until then, shhhhh!

              Cremation takes 4 hours per body and would be impossible to burn more than 60,000 bodies in the timeframe

             <p>
              Every crematorium in Nazi Germany was not limited to burning only one body at a time. The crematoria were huge, and there were lots of them.

             <p>
              aerial photography from allied forces never showed smoke coming from the work camps.

             <p>
              Because the spy planes didnt hang around doing a detailed analysis of what was going on in the death camps. They just took a few photos on a few occasions when they flew past. The crematoria wouldnt have been running most of the time.

            Yup, theres a lot of jealousy in anti-Semitism.  theyre over-achievers, the reason likely being as a minority they found out long ago that in a tie, they lose.  so, they had to be clearly better.  if you dont like some particular jews, fine, but dont blame the whole group.  its a whole population containing everything from saints to crooks with most people in-between.  the jews Ive known were nice.  best wishes to them all.

            The writers grammar, spelling and presentation of these backpeddling lies to GLORIFY a tribe of criminals is pathetic and amateur.  The writers English skills are sorry, and the lies they try to pass off to deflect the guilt of this tribe of murderers and satanists is laughable.  No one, but jews, gained from the slaughter of the Russian and German peoples.  No one, but jews, gained from the slaughters of WW1 and WW2.  After murdering the Czar of Russia, his wife and children, then 40 million Christians by the jewish NKVD in less than 25 years, 22 million innocent Europeans murdered by them in WW2 by saturation bombings of Christian villages and cities, and they even murdered Lindberghs baby and blamed it on a German American man, to teach  the Lindberghs a lesson about supporting National Socialism.  They have been in power from the start and behind the slave ships and trade in Colonial America.  They use the internet to data mine, spy and collect information on those whom might threaten their power, and assassinate anyone who is influential enough to share the truth regarding their deception to the world portraying themselves as the victims, when in actuality the polar opposite is true.  All one needs to seal this truth is the Israeli Mossads own assertion and motto:  By Deception We Shall Rule.

                    Spelling, grammar and sentence structure is important to look at as it is a clue to the IQ level were dealing with. For example, all sentences should start with a capital letter. Dont believe me? Ask any 6 year old.

                    Ummmyes you can.  Any English professor will disagree with your pseudo-intellectual, falsely pedantic grammatical rules.  Yes, we teach young children these things, to instill good habits in the usage of formal grammarbut that doesnt apply to the proper use of English as a whole.  We also teach children not to begin sentences with and or but, but these are not improper grammatical structures, they are only introductory guidelines to prepare new speakers with basic writing guidelines to avoid mistakes.  For example is absolutely an acceptable introductory statement (also an acceptable interjection), for anyone with an education in English higher than 7th grade (in the USA).

                    Spelling,or someone hitting the wrong key,or punctuation mark,is not a reason to berate someone. When someone has a different opinion than you do,that is all it is. Different. Just because they do not look at life through the same toilet paper tube you do,does not make them wrong.

                    News flash to all you antisemitic bigots out there Jew is not a race. Mose Jewish people are white. You talk about sentence structure etc. being a way to judge someone elses I.Q. yet people like you and others think nothing of using foul language like some ignorant Troglodyte to get your point across.I am not accusing you personally of cursing,but I have not doubt you would if you thought it would help.

                    No its used as an excuse to deflect the truth. Jews are pathological liars, they dont even know they are doing it. This is the internet, not the next NY Times best seller trash. But this article sucks and doesnt really address the reality and gravity of the Jewish problem.

                the whole thing is patheticwhen Israel was formed the nation state was already an anachronismit wasnt the answer, the answer is there is no such thing as race and the sooner we all fuck each other so we are all the same color and get rid of borders and share resources instead of fighting over them, we may regain our humanity. I live in Australia and the racism and stupidity makes me sick, and it all comes from the top. I used to work with a lot of Jews back in the eighties..the were hilarious, and the most generous people I have ever met

                    Judaism is not a race, its a religion. How much the Jews, and their extremist opposition insist otherwise is irrelevant: The race is called semites.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Disliking people for being Jews can be perfectly justified by an analysis of the religion and what it teaches  for example, that it is morally right to commit genocide against the natives of a land as long as your religion says you are entitled to it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But disliking people for being semitic IS racist.

                Congratulations! You have just proved the theory that there is no limit to human stupidity.
                <br/>
                I find your comment not only laughable but childish, immature, unwise and exceptionally dull witted. Not only does it read like a mentally challenged imbecile wrote it, it reeks of bigotry, racism and inane half baked, mindless ideas.

                Spelling, grammar and sentence structure is important to look at as it is a clue to the IQ level were dealing with. Your IQ must be the same as your shoe size.

              They were not behind the slave ships.  Some Jews financed slave trading voyages because they were found wherever money was to be made, but they were not the main influence.  There were many, many more Christian Europeans who were behind the slave trading voyages and the idea that Jews were somehow disproportionately responsible is a malicious attempt to falsely shift the blame from European Christians onto the Jews.  They were involved, but they were not disproportionately involved compared to their population.  In other words, there were a hell of a lot more Christians involved than Jews.

              Anyway, Arab Muslims were involved in the black slave trade for many centuries before European Christians or Jews, so wake the hell up and stop trying to shift blame onto one religion or ethnic group.  The black Africans themselves owned lots of black slaves and it was almost all black Africans who captured the black slaves and sold them to Europeans in the ports.  Slavery was legal in Africa for many centuries before European colonialism.  In spite of their various moral failures, it was ultimately the European colonists who caused slavery to become illegal in Africa, not the Africans themselves.

                  Giving an example of one group of Jews who were involved in the slave trade does not prove that Judaism as a whole was disproportionately responsible for the slave trade.

              Jews dont worship satan, they worship the same god christians do. All races are guilty of murder. Even god is guilty of murder. And if you believe in god, then you must also believe that everything is his will, since that is what the bible says. So if the jews are successful, rich, and powerful, it is gods will that they are. The jews are gods chosen people after all. To be dissatisfied with that is to go against god. Be humble and enjoy your station in life. Dont covet.

              Lol your comment is laughable and I hope youre trolling because then Im really sorry that you believe anything you read on the internet without thinking about it.
              <br/>
              Firstly jews werent behind the Soviet Unions Gulag system, true higher officials of security forces were jews but only at a degree of 20% so why blame 20% while there is still another 80% to blame?
              <br/>
              Also what do you mean the Jews gained from the holocaust?? After being persecuted only because theyre born in a certain ethnicity dont they deserve to get their former national territory back??
              <br/>
              And are you mad or are you a totalitarian fascist-loving monarchist? the Bolsheviks killed Czar along with his family as happens to every revolution to a monarchy, see french revolution what french are war criminals mow for assassinating the royal family? ever read why they did it, what about bloody sunday??
              <br/>
              Also as a computer software engineer I can tell you that everyone mines data on internet even the small e-shops, and many states also have Intelligence aspionage and assasination agencies. Also Christians did the crusades and the inquisition what all Christians are bad now?? USA nuked a Country,and invaded many more afterwards Germany invaded Europe,England started an 100 year war Ancient Egypt was a warmongering nation, Muslims have a holy war, Napoleon started a massacre and so on, so what just because some people are criminals a whole nation is composed of criminals. Then the whole world is composed of criminals.
              <br/>
              It really makes it easier and more convenient for you to blame a nation for all your problems. Please for your own good stop reproducing that propaganda of yours it only makes you look stupid and ignorant. And start reading about antisemetism throughout the ages try medieval Italy for example, or better yet get a proper education from non-biased sources and get off the internet which is filled with bullshit written by amateur historians that post propaganda to forward their own beliefs and agenda.

                  Its true though. If the Arabs stopped attacking Israel and just let them be and defend themselves from Israeli soldiers theyd be more in the right. There might even be some sort of peace.

                    What about all the Jews living outside Israel? Why are they hated also? They havent done anything wrong except be born of the same religion. I can understand hatred of Zionists, but Jews in general?

                  This article started out objective but quickly took on a bit of stereotypical overtones. At first blush I thought it was an attempt to tackle the why behind a blind hatred but quickly the author descended into anti-Semitic propoganda; Islamic hatred; and an attack on (sometimes misguided) western idiologies. All around a bunch of bullshit.

                Nice trythe Gulags were created by Jewsthere were Jews in there as prisoners too -but that doesnt change the fact that a religious EXTREMIST minority organized and created a criminal movement that attacked the culture and people (and their leaders-the Russian Royal family were massacred by Jews as revealed by gloating Jewish Bolsheviks) in a nation where they were a minority associated with societal degradation -selling sex, alcohol drugs and usury -non productive jobs. The Russian genocide was a Jewish invention -planned and executed by Jewish leaders in Stalins government. Fact.

                ..only because of their ethnicity  total bollocks and you know it -all your people know it..the persecution myth was slain a long time ago. Because of what they BELIEVE and what those beliefs mak e them do.  Thats the problem that your persecution myth is meant to try and cover up.  Being in denial about it (for the uninitiated or naive liberal Jews) is another reason why people hate Jews.  Because Jews are taught that non-Jews are inferior i think this brings on pyschological disability of thinking that non-Jews will believe anything Jews say  regardless of how dishonest it is. The most effective deceit comes from those who are self-deceiveda major proportion of the greater Jewish community

                  Jews are taught that non Jews are inferior? When did you get that tripe from.? And how is it taught? In school, at a family dinner or at an evening class? I think your broad and sweeping statements show you for the bigot you are. Not one Jew I have met has ever said they are superior and all others are inferior. Yet you say they are taught? And you say they persecution myth was slain a long time ago, yet you keep persecuting them in your way by giving us reasons why people hate Jews. Which is it? People hate them, or Jews just imagine they hate them

                    Do a Google search for racist quotes from the talmud. This will put the lie to your idea that Jews dont think they are better than the non Jew. It teaches the goy has no soul, a Jew may steal from a goy, kill a goy, Jesus is being boiled in his own excrement, Jews may have sex with a goy of 3 years old. It also says that if a Jew reveals to a goy the contents of the talmud, what it really says about the goy, that Jew must be destroyed completely.
                    <br/>
                    Look it all up. Youll see where anti semitism really comes from. Its a reaction to the Jews hatred for the goy.

                    It is the Americanized version of my real Mohawk name. Apache are not the only nation here. Really? So all those southwester people with spanish surnames are not REAL natives to you. Neither was Russell Means or Dennis Banks or Clyde Bellecourt I suppose. If I thought you could pronounce it I would give you my native name. But I doubt you speak Haoudanasanee

                    No, those people with Spanish names are NOT real nativesthey are Mixtecs.  Spanish names came with Spanish invaders.  You sound like every other white man who says You know, Im 1/16th Apache.  I was raised on a reservation in Ruidoso, NM.  I can pronounce anything in my proper familys language.  Why would I bother trying to pronounce Iroquois?  Youre a poseur, at best.  I know Iroquoisthey dont sound ignorant like you.  Spanish names for natives, hahahaha, ok, back to your Washington Redskins game Wasichu(yes, I know that isnt Apache, its Dakota, but its as real as your supposed Haoudanasanee).

                    Funny, my Iroquois friends tend to use the term Six Nations, not People of the Long House.  Sounds like Google is more your friend than Apple (thats a joke).  Yes, Mescalero is the modern (time I was born) term for the peoples of Shis-Inday descent.  We are Athabascan like our Navajo brothers, who call us NashgaliDine.  Your white family will probably know us for the name of Mescaline, which your hippie family members used unceremoniously to feel less like invaders and more like participators.  I say Mescalero here because that is the name of the land I was born into.  I still havent caught your supposed Iroquois name

                    I fail to understand why we are arguing about this. In todays hostile environment why would anyone claim Native blood if they did not have it? Dont you think we have enough trouble with the paste faces,without attacking each other? Oh,I get it. Some of your best friends are Iroquois right?  You sound just like Ted Cruz.

                    The fact that you dont understand my point proves you have no Native culture.  It isnt about American football, stupid, its about your heritage.  You missed the obvious clue.  Thanks for proving your ignorance of the peoples you claim.

              Actually the Writer is a bitter anti Semite and have strong views against Israel and continuously says with no uncertain terms that Israel is immoral which is not true and the writer looks like she basis most of her 10 reasons why people hate Jews in almost every single one of them talks about the Jews and the Palestinians this is only one reason but she links them all together. Her bio shows that shes a Muslim born in that region so she hates Jews.

                Jews funded and perpetrated (profitable) usury against slavers and merchants who supported the slave economy.  For further details, consult your local institutions of higher learning

              THIS IS SO WRONG I WANT TO CRY!

              I am not a Jew but I study history and you are killing me.
              <br/>
              Jews did not kill Czar Nicholas II of Russia! There were Jews in the Bolshevik movement that overthrew Czarism but thats because many lived in Russia at the time.
              <br/>
              The Jews are not a tribe of criminals but an ancient people with a set of strong values.Some are bad, I agree, but then you always have bad people, whatever the religion.
              <br/>
              Dont say these things Eddie as they are not true.Spread positivity, not hate!

            This article is ridiculous, unnecessarily hateful, and downright wrong. Please do not lump people into one category. I am not saying that you are hateful as a person, but this article is. Please educate yourself about the Jewish religion before labeling everyone as one person. Im sure if you had the chance to meet a person of the Jewish faith, your opinion would change. Everyone has the ability to think good thoughts towards other people no matter what their religion, race, sexual orientation, or gender.

              Ester  I have to disagree with you  this article was written, as I see it, as irony  tongue in cheek in some ways. The author has basically stated why observed reasons why it seems people hate the Jews.  It does not make is so, except for the mind set of those who believe some of these ridiculous notions. Therein lies the problem not in the observance of what could be the problem. You follow? I got the feeling the author, Rhea Samyal was theorizing what some of the causes may be.

                Alas, the tribe is undoubtedly aware of the justifications for the largely prevalent attitudes. They would rather delude both themselves and the populace that remains unaware of their great, but terrible influence.

            Very, very interesting. I really believe that envy makes societies hate the Jews. Throughout history hatred has always targeted those who were successful, of which in the Jewish culture there are many.(IQ) I am not a Jew, but a very observant and aware person who has been on this planet, for a long, long time. Thank god for the Jews  seriously!!

              Their greatest contribution is the institution of a central reserve bank (the Fed, in the US) that perpetuates a monetary policy in which exponentially increasing debt is an inevitability. How could the world not be thankful? (Sarcasm)

            Lies lies lies.  The jews are responsible for every facet of corruption in western nations. They control the banks and international think tanks that are responsible for every degenerate -ism fad and false movement. They corrupt the schools through Leftist Jewish Marxism. They control all major media networks and Hollywood. Why is census information on the Jews often blocked?  Why is society so sick when compared to the beauty of past civilizations that did not tolerate nor accept Jews (Rome) They are responsible for creating every world war. They deserve more hatred and violence not less.

It is like someone who has never had cancer glorifying cancer, lifting their pompous nose in the air and reviling those who remove cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are a viscous self serving tribe determined to capture power and wealth because they believe it will protect them, not realizing due to pride that their selfish and cruel behavior is the very reason they are attacked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Indians are similarly proud and ignorant and will only learn after Jews takeover their developing country and turn it into a vassal of Israel, subjecting it to an endless war with Pakistand and Iran.

              Actually the power and wealth did protect them.  The Jews survived when the Arabs attacked them in 1948 because wealthy Jewish bankers in America gave them money to buy weapons.  In the beginning it was not the UK, the USA, or the UN that gave Israel the power to survive, it was wealthy Jewish bankers living in the USA who were acting independently of the government.

                Whose money is in the Bank? Is it the Jews money? No it is the money belonging to the American people, it is their private property. The Jews use it without their permission and oversight to engage in political action which they see as beneficial to their tribe.

                  It was not the American peoples money, it was their own personal money that they made as bank owners and businessmen.  If I own a bank and you have money in it, then it is your money.  However, if the bank makes me $1,000,000 by lending money to people and businesses, then it is my $1,000,000, not yours.  See the difference?  In 1948 there were a lot of very rich Jews in the USA who made their money legally and legitimately as bankers and business owners.  They sent their own personal money that they made honestly and legally to the Israelis so the Israelis could defend themselves against the evil men who wanted to harm them.

                    Jewish international financiers place the interests of the Jewish tribe above the interests of their home nations and above the interests of those whose money is in the bank.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Most famously, Jacob Shiff, financed the destruction (and execution) of the Russian royal family to get revenge for his tribe (which is always innocent and pure).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Of course, if you are speaking from the profits of finance, you are correct. As with the example of the Tsar, these profits were to advance the interests of Jew over Gentile. Jews buying bullets to kill the natives of Palestine and make way for the Jew. I am sure there were similar associations in the American 1800s to buy bullets for settlers to kill Native Americans.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you are speaking of generous loans by international banks ran by Jews, you are incorrect. In the latter, they are forcing gentiles to accept risk based on their selfish tribal mindset.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Hitler also assisted in the funding you are speaking of. Before the final solution, he tried others. After confiscating Jewish wealth, he had it invested as a tab in Israeli companies who would then deliver it back to Jewish owners in the form of goods and services upon their arrival in the promised land. Hitler forced Jews to invest in Israel.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    All of this is nothing compared to later US interest free loans, which ended up being just given to Israel, and direct foreign aid. The Jewish lobby in America has funneled $120,472 billion dollars to Israel. This is tax payer money milked from the goyim.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So the definition of evil is wanting to harm the Jews. This the typical subjective morality demonstrated by ethnocentric members of the tribe. What is good for the Jews is good.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I am most certainly evil, because I do not believe your selfish tribalistic behavior at the expense of gentiles is moral, and you would certainly construe that as wanting to harm the Jews/

                    About 3/4 of the US aid to Israel has to be spent on US arms and consulting.  The US arms industry is naturally very pro subsidizing the Israeli military.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Comparing the Palestinians to the Native Americans is somewhat misleading.  There are about 1.7 million Arab Muslims living in Israels borders right now, and another 4 million or so in the West Bank and Gaza.  In 1948 there were only about 1.2 million in the region.

                    The Jews are a lot of things and yes, many of them are greedy, but they are not evil.  They do not seek to oppress others and they do not delight in any more death than is necessary to make their enemies leave them the fuck alone.

                    The Palestinians are comparable to Native Americans as a people displaced violently by settlers.

                    I never said Jews are evil. Jews are just normal people. The problem is many of them are stuck in a 2000+ year old tribal mentality that has no place in the modern world.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The just attitude you project upon the Jews is your own. Many Jews may have that attitude and many do not.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The attitude I am disparaging is that of sociopathic disregard for gentile interests in the pursuance of Jewish tribal interests, especially the protection of their tribe. Among those Jews with this mentality, there are gradations. Many of the most influential Jews have this mentality to the extreme.

                    In the months leading up to the war in 1948, Golda Meir, the future prime minister of Israel, knew that war was coming.  She went to America to raise money from wealthy American Jews so that the Jews in Israel could buy weapons to defend themselves.  She hoped to raise $7 million, and she ended up raising around $50 million, which went a lot farther back then.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Today, Israel is home to many Jews from Middle Eastern countries and their descendants, many of whom are mixed with European Jews from intermarriage.  However, in 1948, most of the Jews in Israel were European Jews.  They and their ancestors had immigrated to Palestine fleeing pogroms, persecution, and oppression in the Russian Empire and other parts of Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Some of the European Jews ended up in the Americas, others ended up in Palestine, but they all knew they had to leave Europe.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Notwithstanding their cultural and distant ancestral ties to the land, the European Jews in Palestine also had nowhere else to go when the war was approaching.  If you can blame them for defending themselves, there is something wrong with your moral compass.  If you can blame the American Jews who financed them with their honestly and legally earned money just three years after the end of World War 2 and the holocaust, there is something wrong with your moral compass.  If you can blame todays citizens of Israel for preventing the Muslims from killing them or subjugating them and going ISIS on them, there is something wrong with your moral compass.

                    If you cannot see both sides of the issue, there is something wrong with your moral compass. The Palestinians were (and are) also defending themselves.

                    When European settlers passed the Mississippi to build homes on the frontier, they had to defend themselves from the Native American tribes upon whose land they were encroaching.  In the conflict between the two, who has the greater moral justification in self defense?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We cannot blame the settlers for arming and defending themselves from the Indian war path but they are, after all, invading someones land.

                   <p>
                    I am not saying Israel should not defend itself. I am saying Jews living in America should not manipulate the US government, exploit the American people financially, or attempt to control public opinion for the benefit of a foreign nation.

                   <p>

                    That is the problem, you put the Jews first due to tribal loyalty. Being equipoised and adhering to abstract moral principles such as justice, tolerance, compassion and forgiveness is a higher platform and gives a better result. If you undercut these principles by tribal loyalties and develop a me first subjective morality, you will always find yourself embroiled in conflict.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Especially placing Jewish freedom over Palestinian lives is dubious. Jewish freedom will come when Jews stop fighting for freedom and place the interests of others above their own.

                For the first 300 years or so after the death of Christ, Jews were hated by Christians for religious reasons. Part of it was the whole rejection of the messiah thing, but it was also driven by the historical persecution of Christians by Jews. The first martyrs were killed by Jews, who ruthlessly tried to stamp our Christianity. It was a mutual violent hatred from the beginning.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Talmuds declares that Jesus was a black magician, the son of a prostitute and a Roman soldier, who is boiling in excrement in hell. Christians are idol worshipers who worship morbid statues of this black magician who was rightfully executed by a rabbinical court.
               </p>
               <p>
                During the middle ages, and all the way up to the late 1800s, Jews were the wealthy middle management of Europe. They worked as tax collectors on behalf of the European royal elite.and oppressed the peasants and surfs, who formed the vast majority of the population. They were not poor, it is just the opposite.
               </p>
               <p>
                They oppressed the serfs with great prejudice. Their Talmud tells them to abuse the gentiles who are the natural slaves of the Jews. The pogroms were usually economic uprisings against the Jewish rulers. (Interestingly Jews would later glorify the oppressed workers of the world through Marxism, but never admit these pogroms were driven by economic oppression perpetrated by their ancestors). This was most prominent in Eastern Europe.
               </p>
               <p>
                After the Jewish haskalah, or enlightenment, when Jews were no longer subjected to the iron fist of the Jewish rabbinical authorities (who were backed by gentile nobility), the Jewish ghettos disintegrated and Jews began to spread into gentile society. This was the beginning of modern antisemitism.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jews do not assimilate like other peoples. They vigorously work to preserve their separateness and/or adjust the gentile society to more resemble their own mindset. This is where Jewish leftism and Jewish radicalism comes in.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jews attack the very foundation of gentile societies through academia, media, and promoting open immigration policies. All of this is to make gentile societies more comfortable for the Jews. Behind all of this is a deep rooted Jewish hatred from gentiles. Modern Antisemitism is merely the gentile recognition that they are under attack from the Jews.
               </p>
               <p>
                The newest turn of events is the appearance of the Jewish Right. The creation of Israel and the resurgence of Talmudic antigentilism has provoked a brand of antisemitism that has not been seen since the ancient Greeks lived among the extreme ethnic tribalism of their Jewish neighbors.
               </p>
               <p>
                Finally, the Jewish Right (and Left) in America have worked to subvert the US government and people through lobbying groups like AIPAC, which send billions and billions a year to Israel, and use our government and military as their stooge.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you would like to know why they were hated over 2000 years ago, by the Romans and Greeks, I recommend you read Josephuss The Jewish War.
               </p>
               <p>
                For the last 2000 years, I recommend this book written by a Leftist Israeli Jew and former IDF soldier.

            #1 reason and probably the only one.  Because they are deeply racist, hypocritical and have deep sown cultural hatreds and disdain for other peoples and their common laws.  From my experience being nothing but cordial to them,  (not all Jews, some are amazing loving people) a good proportion of them are xenophobic and racist.
           </p>

              That is basically it. Their hatred for non-Jews was attested to by the Greeks 2000+ years ago. It is part of their religion. They feel they are superior and look down upon non-Jews with a propensity to exploit and mistreat them. In essence to they do not respect other peoples nations or religions and destroy them without a care.

                I am not agreeing with you, but even if that were truefor you to say that as a person of Spanish descent is like the pot calling the kettle black.  Do you have any idea how the Spanish treated the natives of the Western hemisphere in the colonial period?

                  If you said that, you would be entirely right. The Jews are to whites what whites are to the rest of the world. A conquering tribe that says my group comes first, screw everyone else.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As far as me being of Spanish descent, unlike the Jews, the broad minded Spanish intermarried with the natives and created an entire Mestizo people. Like the WASP English of North America, the Jews have had a historical determination to maintain their pure blood line.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Besides, the age of race driven European Empire ended 100 years ago, your people are still at it today, and that is what we are discussing. The cultural ripples of European colonialism may have lasted all the way until the 1960s but the Jews in America beat them to death during the Civil Rights Movement.

                  Above all of this, you are talking about what my ancestors may or may not have done 400 years ago. We are talking about what the Jews are doing TODAY.

                Yah nice try deflecting, another reason people hate jews is they cant take honest criticism without crying:  the muslims, the muslims!    anti-semite no one hates the muslims! Yet you cant even take a minute out of your life to use google.

                  Why are you changing the subject? you dont have an answer?
                  <br/>
                  Muslims see themselves as superior and christians and jews are inferior to them (Dhimmi). So why theres no such hate towards them *as* to jews? (jews are way more hated than muslims theres nothing to even compare the both).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  plus, think about all the global terrorism (Jihad). So- why?
                  <br/>

                  Why are you changing the subject?? Everything you claim the jews do  the muslims do and even worse. christians (and jews) are inferior (Dhimmi). Plus, all the Global Terrorism. So why people hate jews more than muslims?        (way more than muslims dont even try to compare).

                    The subject is jews doofus.   All you have to do is scroll up and read the title of the article.    Also you spelt hypocrisy incorrectly.   If you cant cogently criticize my point without bringing up a people that have nothing to do with the article,  then there is no helping you or having a constructive dialogue.   Its best to just stop typing and move along maam.

            I am hitler and I will tell u why jews hate me. Aryans r suprior to goyim so u hate me. I grabbed power ligitimately so u hate me. Aryans exceed in industry and honesty so u hate me.  If jews dropped down their lie then peace will come but they never will. If I drpped down my lie then great germany shall not be. Lastly holocaust myth made me so called killer of jews but u ignore the fact that I myself am a partly jew funded by zionist so why blame me.    Soooo this looks quite similar to your ugly jewish justification that sux doesnt it.

              Actually, white European Jews are not just Khazar converts.  There were many Jews from other parts of the world who moved to Eastern Europe in the middle ages and married people there.  Most white Jews are mostly European from mixing with Europeans, but they have some Middle Eastern DNA in them as well.

                  Chosen doesnt mean better.  It simply means they were the ones who were given the Torah and for a long time, they were the only nation that worshiped the Lord.  If you accept the Lord as your God then you are equal to a Jew in the Lords eyes.

                    Equal to a Jew in the Lords eyes.  That means the Lord doesnt like Jews better than you and he doesnt value Jewish life over your own if the Lord is your God because you are a Christian, Muslim, etc. but if you are a Pagan it is another story.  Even in the Old Testament one of the Lords commands to the Israelite people is to treat foreigners with the same scale of justice they use for each other.

                    Are you dumb?  Do you even understand Christianity?  The Lord chose the Jews as the people with whom he made the first covenant at Mount Sinai.  The first covenant led to the creation of Israel as the first nation to worship the Lord as its only God, although some Israelites went astray and worshiped pagan gods as well.  Nevertheless, at the time of Jesus Christ Israel was a place where the Lord was the only god worshiped by most people there.  Thats why Israel is where the Lord incarnated as Jesus Christ and made the second covenant.  The second covenant is between the Lord and all of humanity.  If you are a Christian you believe that the Israelites were chosen as the people with whom the first covenant was made.  Not chosen to be better than everyone.  Not chosen to rule everyone like royalty.  Chosen as the people with whom the first covenant was made.  If you are a Christian, you believe the Israelites were chosen for the first covenant at the time of the Exodus but you also believe Jesus Christ is the path to the Lord through the second covenant.

            10 real reasons ppl hate jews like thee
            <br/>
            1. Racial cleansing conducted by israel
            <br/>
            2. Zionist racism theory
            <br/>
            3. Lower moral valuetorah and talmud which justifies genocide on gentiles which means underdevelopment from tribal level of morality.
            <br/>
            4. Distorting and censuring public opinion by power and money.
            <br/>
            5. Bribing and lobbyng for success corruptoring society system
            <br/>
            6.not only global scale usury but also treachery against human dignity
            <br/>
            7. Masscre thousands of defenseless palestinian women and children and have no intelligence but to call it just a conflict . No brain to tell genocide from conflict.
            <br/>
            8. Most americans hate jews from the bottom of their heart but oppressed not to express it by name of anti semitic blahblah which more makes usa ppl hate jews.
            <br/>
            9. Cursing and ridiculing jesus and western culture.
            <br/>
            10. Shrewdness and slyness of writing another hatred evoking thread like this in which a jew brages off their subhuman morality to the disgusting level.
            <br/>
            No wonder mental illness is main characteristics of jews which your worthless self serving schizophrenia writing proves truthfullness of.

              i would like 2 point out that not being a jew, nor having a full understanding of any commentary on the Torah, you do not know what you are talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              further more, i will bring a case in which a gentile brought a passage saying that jews do not consider gentiles to be adam meaning man. this is because the word adam has no feminine nor a plural, showing how jews are one. gentiles do not consider themselves to be as one, or that we are all bothers.( like the torah says- like one man with one heart.)
              <br/>
              however the word people usually use for man, is ish. ishah for a girl . a jew or a gentile alike can be called so.

              I see #3 as the root cause of them all. They are stuck in tribal mode. It is not a beneficent tribe but a cruel vindictive tribe that cares nothing for gentile tribes and happily works against or destroys them without pain of conscience if it suits their interests.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, on #9, many Jews have a distinct hatred for Christianity, which arises from their 2000+ year old belief that Jesus was a devil worshiping failed messiah. This leads them to attack the morality of Western Civilization. They love to show irreverence towards our moral authority which degrades us. Just look what they have done through Hollywood and Television.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some Jews believe to they must demoralize us for their own protection. Check out this Jew admitting he shows the Christ in Urine art to push the boundaries of what is considered right and wrong so the Jews will be tolerated.

            Written like a typical Jewish defender. The Jews are the Anti-Christ, pin that on them. God himself said the Jews would be a by-word among the nations. Jesus said that their house was to be abandoned, Mat 23:38. lastly, the Apostle Paul says the Jews were against all mankind
            <br/>
            1 Thessalonians 2: 14-16 oh and one more, the Bible mentions those that call themselves Jews from the synagogue  of Satan, Rev 2:9, 3:9.

            Sayanim Everywhere (Hebrew for undercover spies loyal to Israel) by Texe Marrs
           </p>
           <p>
            Israeli spies have done more harm and have damaged the United States more than the intelligence agents of all other countries on earth combined They are the gravest threat to our national security.  Admiral Bobby Inman, Former Deputy Director of the CIA
           </p>
           <p>
            We in the West have been the target audience of an Israel program, a subtle program that permeates our culture and indoctrinates us from an early age through religious training, public schooling and the media, to believe in the goodness of Israel and its right to existence as a well-deserved homeland for the Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this very moment, throughout America, in every city and town of even moderate size, dedicated undercover agents are hard at work. These spies are everywhere, stealing classified material, filching secret documents, plotting terrorist attacks, and devising new means of how America can best be conquered and its citizens subjugated.
           </p>
           <p>
            This army of enemy spies is, surprisingly, not made up of Arabs or Iranians. Theyre not Russians or Chinese either. They are the Sayanim. Jews born and raised in America, who, regardless of the blessings and financial rewards bestowed on them as Americans, are turncoats and traitors.
           </p>
           <p>
            These Benedict Arnold-types willingly collude with a foreign power [FAKE Israel] and plot to damage America by serving that foreign power, the nation of Israel, as undercover spies, saboteurs, and intel agents. To most Jews, their origin of birth is of no consequence. They are Israel-firsters and are traitors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since America has a Jewish population of 7.5 million, our nation is bulging with Israeli spies willing to steal, lie, cheat, or even kill if necessary for their chosen nation Israel. They possess no loyalty to their native born country, the U.S.A., but have, since birth, been propagandized and indoctrinated by fanatical Zionist parents, relatives, teachers, and rabbis. They are Zionist zealots through and through, and many are dual citizens of both Israel and the U.S.A.
           </p>
           <p>
            They Stole Americas Nuclear Secrets
            <br/>
            In Texe Marrs expos book, Conspiracy of the Six-Pointed Star, the reader discovers the names and damaging acts of the Sayanim (Hebrew for undercover spies loyal to Israel). For example, take Abraham Feinberg. According to FBI files, Feinberg, a wealthy American Jew from New York City who owned manufacturing and construction companies, led a secret cabal of seventy other Sayanim agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Together, Feinberg and his underlings committed numerous acts of criminality. They stole nuclear material and uranium, sending it to Israel. It was Feinbergs spying crimes in the late 1940s and early 1950s that enabled both Soviet Russia and Israel to develop atomic bombs.
           </p>
           <p>
            American Jews Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were Sayanim agents. These two heinously stole atomic bomb plans and turned them over to the Communists. With their help, Stalin and the USSR built its first nuclear bomb. Tried in federal criminal court for espionage, the treacherous Rosenbergs were found guilty and were put to death in the electric chair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jewish sayan spy Abraham Feinberg is shown here looking over the left shoulder of First Lady Bess Truman. President Harry Truman is at left. Reportedly, Feinberg bribed Truman to have the United States recognize Israels statehood in 1948.

            Jewish Communist spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were found guilty of stealing atom bomb secrets and passing them on to Soviet Russia. They died in the electric chair.

            The Most Grievous Crime in the History of America
            <br/>
            According to FBI and CIA sources, the most grievous spy crime in the history of the U.S.A was perpetrated by a Galveston, Texas-born Jew, Jonathan Pollard. Working clandestinely for the Israeli Mossad, Pollard got a mid-level job at the Pentagon. Bold and audacious, he was able to steal over 10,000 top-secret documents. He gave this stolen material to his superiorsMossad operatives working out of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Israeli government then sold these documents to our enemy, Communist Red China.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result, tens of millions of American lives were instantly placed in jeopardy, because through this material, Red China had access to the launch codes of Americas nuclear-armed missiles and was able to track the location of every single one of this nations underwater submarines in the seas all over the globe.
           </p>
           <p>
            After discovering the full extent of Pollard and Israels monstrous crime, the U.S. Defense Department was reportedly forced to spend over 20 billion dollars changing and modifying defense systems to mitigate the damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            For his monumental betrayal of his native country, the U.S.A., Jonathan Pollard is today languishing in a federal prison cell. Rightly so. Yet, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu demands that President Obama release Pollard and give the convicted spy a full and complete pardon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, in Israel, the public lauds Pollard as a national hero! Schools and streets are named after him, and his wife and children are handsomely provided for.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am convinced that as the years have gone by since Israels founding as a militant, anti-Christian socialist entity in 1948, the influence and reach of the Sayanim has grown. Today, our government is thick with Israel first operatives. Among them, I believe, are:
           </p>
           <p>
            Senators Joseph Lieberman, John McCain, and Charles Schumer
            <br/>
            House Majority Leader Eric Cantor
            <br/>
            Governor Sarah Palin
            <br/>
            Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel
            <br/>
            CFR kingpin Henry Kissinger
            <br/>
            Fox News mogul Rupert Murdoch
            <br/>
            Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
            <br/>
            Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann
            <br/>
            California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi
            <br/>
            New Yorks Koch Brothers
            <br/>
            Texas Governor Rick Perry
            <br/>
            Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum
            <br/>
            Fed Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
            <br/>
            700 Club host Pat Robertson
            <br/>
            Democratic Party Chairwoman Debra Wasserman Schultz
            <br/>
            Note: Amazingly, both President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney are proven to be puppets of Israel and the Mossad. (See Texe Marrs The Evil Twins of Israel Tape or CD)
           </p>
           <p>
            Not every one of the above persons are of Jewish blood. But all are ardent, loyal Zionists in hock to the Jews. Each puts Israel first over his or her native country, the U.S.A.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Thousands More
            <br/>
            Of course, this is only a partial list. To it we can add hundreds of thousands of other influential Sayanimfrom Zionist talk show personalities Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Larry King, and Rachel Maddow, to corrupt Wall Street crooks like CEO Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase Bank.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rich Jews own most computer communications, internet, and social media networksranging from Google and Wikipedia to Microsoft, Dell, Amazon, and Facebook.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just imagine all the surveillance these massive, Jewish-owned organizations are able to conduct over even the most minute details of our lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            From doctors, airline pilots, postmen, and lawyers to chefs, reporters, plumbers, police chiefs, and plain housewives, Sayanim are ready and responsive when they receive a phone call or visit from their superiors in the Mossad. Whether the assigned task is to steal nuclear secrets or to assassinate a designated troublesome enemy, the Sayanim respond.
           </p>
           <p>
            No other nation on earth except Israel is able to marshal and multiply its secret intelligence forces so quickly and effectively.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Plague of Parasites
            <br/>
            They are a plague on all of us, these Sayanim agents. I have personally been victimized by these devils in human clothing [skin]. And so have thousands of other good patriotic Americans.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jewish/Israel Sayanim are today the single most dangerous threat to our national security. It is no wonder that in country after country, these Jewish parasites, at first welcomed in as fellow citizens and neighbors, are eventually found out and expelled. This is not true of Mexicans, Czechs, French, Germans, Italians, Argentines, Irish or any other ethnic groups and peoples.
           </p>
           <p>
            The time is coming when we, too, as patriotic Americans, must decide what we are going to do about the criminal Sayanim inside our borders. To let them continue doing their dirty work and selling out our country is unacceptable.
           </p>
           <p>
            We must act now before it is too latebefore the parasites, like so much cancer, have eaten away at the vital organs of our existence and leave behind only a shell of a once great nation.

            Wow you people are so sad and you wonder why people are becoming more and more dehumanized, the Jews that killed Chris are the Jews youll meet today. You cant blame the present for the past, every religion has had its ups and downs and just because someone doesnt believe in what you do that doesnt give you the right to belittle them, as long as they are not hurting anyone it shouldnt not matter if they believe the sky is green and I believe its red. Im Catholic and some Catholics are hypnotics and bad just like some Jews are hypnotics and bad  and Muslims, no one is perfect and maybe we should try to stop acting like we arent all sinners in some ways more than others. God doesnt want us to hate each other he wants us to forgive one another like he did.

            The author is uninformed and sentimental. If you want to know the reason listen to a Jew explain it himself:

            They do not acknowledge or respect other peoples religions and nations. As a result, they are a sociopathic force of destruction in non-Jewish societies.

            Rhea Samyal is a Kashmiri. Note in her bio, the shades of sentimental glorification of her homeland arising from devotion to ethnicity.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a long tradition of some Kashmiris believing they are descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. In fact, many Kashmiris believe they are Jews who wondered in the deserts of South Asia for 40 years and arrived in the promised land of Kashmir. I believe the authors pro-jewish bias extends from this.

            Jesus was a litlle bitch! He is not our Messiah! He is a whining little cunt, who fyi was a jew and probably gay. Also, he took it in the ass. He belong in hell for lying about being Gods son. He probably sucks Satans dick daily, while being pounded by a freaking minotaur.

            A lot of Jews I have known are a bit arrogant, superior and condescending They tend to think they are smarter than others and therefore better than Gentiles. I have had conversations with them and they have mock non-Jews to my face. On the whole they dont seem that likable and I think Hollywood accidentally encourages that by the annoying Jewish actors, directors and producers populating it. I just dont like them though I find some Ive met unintentionally amusing.

            Wow, thats a lot of spin, right there.
            <br/>
            The jews have never able to coexist peaceably with anybody, anywhere in the world theyve ever gone for 5,000 years. You can try to blame everybody else (Egyptians, Persians, Romans, Poles, Germans, British, Spanish, Russians, Arabs, et al, ad nauseum) and claim that all those people from different cultures, with different religions and languages, at different times throughout history all share the same irrational hate of one little innocent perfect tribe who never do anything wrong, but no marginally intelligent person capable of any kind of critical thought buys that.
            <br/>
            If an individual man spent his whole life being hated, kicked out, barred and reviled by everybody he ever met, everywhere in the world he ever went, all the time and he attempted to claim that he was just a poor, innocent victim that has never done anything wrong and everybody else is dumb, primitive and bigoted and, in fact, even to try to criticize him is an act of hate because hes above criticism, that man would rightfully be thought delusional, neurotic and sick and probably be put in an asylum where he belonged.
            <br/>
            A group of people who cling to an ancient tribal survivalist belief in their own election, their own chosen-ness, their own special place in the word and their own superiority over the rest of humanity might just also qualify as delusional, neurotic and sick. The neurotic, anti-social canard of election and that alone is the sole reason that jews have been incapable of living peaceably with their neighbors. It continues even in this day when no modern, civilized nation on earth can claim to be a democracy that belongs only to one race, ethnicity or religion, except Israel. And that hasnt worked out too well for them either, has it?

            I am not an Israelite or a Jew, but that race has done me nothing but good.  All of my Jewish teachers, doctors, lawyers, psychologists, neighbors etc have taught me to love and fight racism.  I marvel at how God blesses them.  They were chosen through Abram (then later Abraham) from the land of Ur of the wicked satanic Chaldeans to follow God in faith and be blessed financially.  The unexplainable monetary and worldwide influence of all facets of industry by such a persecuted minority is nothing less than magical.  God truly chose and is with this persecuted nation.  Bless them now and forever.  And whomever persecutes them shall have their retribution now and in the afterlife.  God bless Israel. Shalom

            Are you freaking kidding me????   Obviously written by an arrogant new.  Hey shithead,  Christians dont believe that Jews killed Jesus, they believe it was pontious Pilate and the Romans.  So that shows how bright you are, know it all.  But then again, all Jews know it all, dont they??  How dare you assume that Jews as a population  do everything successfully over every other race?   That shows right there why people hate Jews.  I am SO sick of seeing fucking holocaust memorials all over the place.  You people seriously think that you are the only race that faced genocide?  How about Rawanda in the 90s or the Armenians so many years ago!   And by the way, genius, hitler murdered Catholics, blacks and ANYONE who wasnt a white Protestant.  The Jews are arrogant and have always thought they were better than any other population.  They are exclusive, not inclusive and if something horrible happens to another religion or culture,  they could give two shits.  When has Isreal or any Jews ever helped anyone but their OWN????  Give me ONE example of Jews gathering to help anyone other than Jews????  And yet God forbid something happens to Jews and the world doesnt gather to defend, help or rescue them!!!  THAT is NOTHING to be proud of!!  You are not Gods chosen people.  God doesnt like self centered narcissistic people.  You people are nothing more than a boil on the ass of the world.  You deserve to be hated and massacred acting like that.

            Jews are too stupid at too many things for me (or themselves) to consider jews smarter.
            <br/>
            just a few thoughts.
            <br/>
            the greeks coetanean to the ancient jews were faremore intelligent, smarter and more developed than the jews in all areas of human achievement.
            <br/>
            Just look:
            <br/>
            philosophy (the use of reason to understand the world and humans), instead of believing in a magical god with all the answers and no need to try toeunderstand anything. the greeks cut the gods down to size.
            <br/>
            unfortunately the masses found, like jews do, the jewis magical god too tempting (no needeto think) and the roman emperor decided to adopt christianity, a copy of judaism.
            <br/>
            math, geometry, sculpture, painting, architecture, theater, astronomy, medicine, music, acceptance of the human nature, including the body (instead of the shame of the body judaism carries within), democracy, literature, poetry, academic institutions instead of limiting all valid intellectual life to praying and trying to understand what god told moses in moun sinai or whatever the prophets wrote.
            <br/>
            christianity basically prohibited the descendants of greeks and romans from thinking until the non jews of florence reconnected with ancient greek thought and started to push the jewish-christian god back. that god has been in retreat since galileo and copernicus decidedeto think again like the greeks using reason. the job is not fully done yet but is not far the god gently dies its ethernal death.
            <br/>
            Jews never in their history created a civilisation, all the accomplisments of jews historically happened within the intellectual structures and physical means created by other civilizations. there would be no einstein without germany, there would be no bob dylan without the us and on and on.
            <br/>
            even whatever israel has of a modern country it owes to to ashkenazi (german jews) by the way, germany with no jews and 90 million people packed in land smaller than california and no natural resources other than water has managed to set up a society with far better quality of life, health care, all sort of public works, free university, education, more vacation and workyear of 1400 hours for the 1700 (8 weeks).
           </p>
           <p>
            so jews are not so smart as never in their history have created a model society for otherssto look up to.
           </p>
           <p>
            furthermore, germans have no need to emigrate to israel (even if they were allowedeto) while israelis do emigrate to germany, what a humiliation to have to earnea living among the descendants of those who murdered millions of jews and couldedo it again if they become fed up with the jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews are so smart howcome their way of making a living always requires them to live among people who do not like them and practically always end up puttin them in ghettoes, expelling or murdering them.
            <br/>
            if jews were smart they would have set up their own stable, safe and prosperous country long ago, a true light to the nations like the italy of the renaissance was and now are others in europe, partioularly in the north.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews were smart they woul not bank the survival of israel on support by the west putting themelves again at the mercy of non jews. ancient israelis lost their country whenethe the romans got fed up withe the jews and now they will lose it when the new romans, the us, gett fed up with israel and the us jewish lobby.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews were smart they would have developed a way of life tha does not trigger the evil antissemites over and over and forever.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews were so smart. they would not have their terrible history at the mercy of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews were smarter they would have sparked the renaissance, the industral age and on and on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews are high achievers because they are driven to succeed and also as outsiders they can look at some things in better ways buteaslo as outsiders they do not really understand the host society to really improve it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews were so smart they would have notecome up with communism, an evil greater than nazism. to believe that communism can work as sort of promised landeis nuts.
           </p>
           <p>
            If jews were smart they would know the next big wave of antisemitism will hoappen in the us, the early tremors are all over the place yet the jews are in denial, somehow they seem to believe the holocaust , hollywood movies, books and holocaust memorials protect them. on the contrary, they accelerate antisemitism. there are alsready some 45 million hard core antisemites in the us, you alredy saw the words of many during the occupy wall street protests.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, overall jews ar not smarter, it is obvious.
           </p>

            Well, i could go on. the day we do away with christianitys and fully reconnect with ancient greek  thought antisemitism will largely dissappear because one of causes of antisemitism is the silly idea christianity (or islam) can be truer than the judaism that gave birth to both.

            They say Knowledge is Power.  Sometimes, its better to be naive.
            <br/>
            Sometimes the less you know, the better the chances are that you will judge each human being by their own thoughts, words and deeds instead of based on what their people have done in the past.

            I personally dont want to know reasons why I should hate others.  Im Christian. I knew about the blaming Jews for Christs death but I never felt that was a reason to hate, since nobody alive today was even there?!
            <br/>
            Wasnt it Gods plan to sacrifice his son?  It was all part of Gods plan, the way I understand it.
            <br/>
            And if Jews have money and are successful, who cares??  Good for them I say.  We all must make our own way anyways.  Its easier for some of us rather than others, so you just try/work harder for what you want.
            <br/>
            To tell you the truth, today I personally need help with the being more tolerant of Muslims

            It is an untrue statement to say that Christians hate Jews. I am one and I know a lot of Christians. Many of us feel great appreciation for the Jewish people. While we disagree about who Jesus Christ was and what he meant, we appreciate the legacy of spiritual truth that the Jews received and preserved. American support for Jews is strongest in evangelical Christian circles. In fact, my favorite person ever was a Jewish carpenter.

            I live in the united states of opposites and I am  disappointed that our government is influenced by the Jewish pedofiles.for thousands of years the kikes have been kicked out of almost every country.911 is an example. Bush was at a school(Zion).there are so many examples of the Jew there bible says that Christians and catholics are not the chosen ones (thats probably why they sold out Jesus).you dont have to look to hard to see their influence in the world everywhere they go trouble isnt far behind

            Do any historians with common sense still believe that the Germans intentionally instigated the U.S. into reluctantly entering WW1? For all intents &amp; purposes, Germany had the UK, France &amp; Russia on their collective knees when they supposedly sank the Lusitania full of American vacationers(which still didnt convince President Wilson to act) &amp; then attempted to drive the nail home when they offered the Mexicans all the means to attack the U.S. &amp; regain the Southwest

            How could the holocaust be a hoax. I mean the Nazis themselves fully admitted to their crimes. And why would the jews, romas, and other groups Hitler hated go so far as to tatoo and permanantly scar themselves just for what many ignorant people believe is a silly hoax. And I can tell you right now, there is nothing silly about the holocaust, in fact, its dead serious. And I really do mean DEAD. Actually, when I found out holocaust denial existed I asked my self, and I quote, how is this even a real question?

            You talk about deicide being a major reason  well even non Chrisitan nations have ousted Jewish people, so its not accurate. as for talking about success and insinuating a disproportionate amount of success, well Britian, Germany, Japan, and China have excelled without many Jewish people so is not correct. A reason that you failed to mention in the list, as it doesnt put Jewish people in a good (or persecuted) light, is that they have on the whole been insular and blamed everyone but themselves for their problems (much like a child or immature person does). When they do charity it is only for their own people not the generous European (&amp; Amercian) people that they live amongst. Higher moral Torah  have you read the Torah ( Tenach, Old Testament?), it talks of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and in destroying the neighbouring lands etc. (Look at what Isreal are doing to Palestition people, they overtook a land that had 75% palestitions in the name of mercy and persecution them overan them, and now treat them like dogs. Not a recipe for world popularity). Also America does not love Jewish people, it merely loves controlling the Middle East and its natural resources through proxy, Isreal is its sexual puppet.. And very few so called Jews are Related to the original Old Testament Israelites, but are mostly Ukrainian, Russian and intermixed Germans..

              And America was doing exceptionally well without Jewish people up to the 2nd world war, and even now the country is still 90% Christian  so dont take credit for whats not yours. Look to Israel a country 90% Jewish and see the state its in..

            So much hate for Jews. Yes, some Jews did bad things in the past. As did some Christians, Muslims, etc, etc. This doesnt mean the majority are bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a good reason Israel maintains this unfortunate status quo. Lets explore future options that can be taken and their results:
            <br/>
            1. A Palestinian state is created with nut cases still present. Israel would now face a more powerful attacker.
           </p>
           <p>
            2. Israel moves the majority of Palestinians to the main part of Israel (i.e. opens up the internal borders). In the short term, it now has to deal with terrorism. In the long term, it might have to deal with Jews becoming the minority. Given how nuts the nut cases are, Jews are sure to loose out.
           </p>
           <p>
            3. It annihilates the people trying to kill it. Now it faces wide spread criticism from the entire world.
           </p>
           <p>
            So basically, dont expect anything to change too fast.

            This one of the most well defined summation of the facts I have read.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, as I read the responses of antisemitism, the accuracy of this article becomes ever more true. Complaints about grammar and spelling are salacious and show how easily indoctrinated and uncritically accepting the racist mind is of rumor, propaganda and hate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rabid racism survives within a vacuum devoid of facts. As proven here, antisemites have no intelligent response for their racist argument clearly proving every point of this existential informative as well as the difficulty for any antisemite racist to swallow this 10 point composite jagged pill.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, their are some good points for discussion in this article.
           </p>
           <p>
            For instance, it would be more accurate to state that the Israelites did in fact murder Jesus. Yes, the Romans did the actual deed of ending his life but without the Jewish frame-job and conspiracy, it never would have happened. THAT TOO, shows the astounding ignorance of mob violence, peer pressure, racism and the immature weakness of going along with the crowd.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jesus was an innocent man and the Jewish held trial that convicted him, it itself broke the rule of law of the Jews own court system! Only in this wicked twist of laws and minds could they manage the conviction of this innocent man
           </p>
           <p>
            The exoneration by the second vatican council of 63 is a farce. Many of the Jews at the time of his murder succumbed to the propaganda of the Scribes and Pharisees (religiopolitical leaders of that time), Jesus new that. That is why he said to forgive their brainwashed indoctrinated ignorance. That is why all should forgive. Not because of some politicized vatican entity.
           </p>
           <p>
            While particular points such as that make for good discussion, the facts supporting this article are undeniable to the mature empirical mind who refuses to be so utterly weak as to be led by propaganda.

            I find these comments very ironic. People are saying that Jews are evil, genocidal, liars, that manipulate the world order (Im not denying this)  wouldnt this sort of belief lead people to ethnically cleanse the world by massacring the Jews?  Then, these people go on to comment how the Holocaust was a fraud, but, according to your beliefs of the Jews, WOULDNT THE HOLOCAUST BE A GOOD THING? If you agree that Hitler was right (about the Jews), than wouldnt it be plausible that Nazi Germany deliberately killed the Jews in a genocide (or at least tried)????

            You say there would be no violence, but there would still be stolen land, oppressed locals, and backhanded racism.  Not all violence comes in the form of rockets and riflesviolence also occurs through societal disenfranchisement and institutional racism.

            The right-hand path seeks union with and thus dependence on God, the left-hand path seeks a higher law based on knowledge and power. It is the way of independence, self-empowerment, and true personal freedom.

           <p>
            The left-hand path is not evil but part of our heritage and our deep-seated desire to be free, independent, and in control of our own destinies as sentient beings.

            I want Jews out America AS SOON AS FUCKING POSSIBLE. They have caused nothing but havoc, both religiously and politically. I am getting sick and tired of Jewish people shoving down their beliefs in peoples throat just because they think theyre Gods chosen people; BREAKING NEWS: YOURE NOT!

            1) Rothschild.
            <br/>
            2) Judaism.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Seventh-Day Adventist.
           </p>

            4) Mormon/LDS.

            Majority of those Jewish religion needs to leave. Judaism caused nothing but destruction when it comes to religion: I am tired of it. Immensely, it needs to stop. Before 1938, the American people have experienced unprecedented amount of prosperity and freedom thanks to the constitution drafted by the people and the government alike. Now the Rothschild sees opportunity for Israel expansion in 1948 in the United States by bribing the congress through various of mean and replacing US currency with Israel currency: look at all of the Israel symbols inked on US dollars  its everywhere (notably 1 dollar bill). Police are linked to Israel (look at their star-shaped badge). Christianity is now being redefined and outlined by Judaism. Most, if not all, congressmen, elites, military advisers, corporations, and etc are owned by the Jewish people and are wreaking havoc on the gentiles to pave way for more Jewish settlement. My psychiatrist and doctors are Jewish. Monsanto are mostly Jewish. I see Jewish people everywhere and it irritates me to no end. This is precisely the reason why we need to take our country back from those Jewish fucks. Here is what we need to do:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Remove Rothschild for good.
            <br/>
            2) Replace congressmen and governments alike with non-Jewish people. Period.
            <br/>
            3) Jewish cannot run US politics or government offices, theyre banned.
            <br/>
            4) Replace Rothschild currency with Bitcoin.
            <br/>
            5) Exile all Jewish people back to Israel. The notion that we must bless then in order to be blessed is absolutely ridiculous! Its a conditional statement made by God depending on Israel obedience to God, but that never happened and God abandoned his people and re-focused on the gentiles instead. Alias, that infuriates the Jewish people to no end and decided to declare covert war upon everyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            6) Makes those Jewish-fucks compensate the American people for the horrible things they have wrought upon us.
            <br/>
            7) All Judaism-like religion needs to be shut down (Seventh-Day Adventist, Mormon/LDS, and etc) and expunged back to the shit-hole where they belong: Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            8) The Bible indicate that Israel worship Molech (see Acts 7:43 KJV). The Star of David is nowhere  found in the Bible. The Star of David is actually the Star of Remphan (aka Moloch). Now, take your 1 dollar bill and look at the title In God We Trust. Whose God are we trusting? MOLOCH! Not Jesus Christ. Its very obvious here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Acts 7:43
            <br/>
            King James Version (KJV)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
           </p>
           <p>
            1 Thessalonians 2:13-16
            <br/>
            King James Version (KJV)
           </p>
           <p>
            For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:
           </p>
           <p>
            Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
           </p>
           <p>
            Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jewish people dont believe in God; they dont believe in Jesus Christ; thus they ARE THE ANTICHRIST!
           </p>
           <p>
            1 John 2:22
            <br/>
            King James Version (KJV)
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
           </p>
           <p>
            These passages are referring to the Jews. Now we can see why theyre not GODS CHOSEN PEOPLE! AMEN! Now I have to ask myself this question: whats taking God so long to get rid of the Jews? Because of grace and long-suffering; but that will come to and end soon.

            Contemporary  anti-semitism is not the racism as the Semites have the same prejudice.Even Hitler and nazies highly evaluated Muslims and Islam,that ptoves the not racial base of his hate. So the cultural root is evident :  it is the Christian tradition expressed in the Theology of replacement. Though church hierarchs does not promote this today, the culture of the Christian countries contain it. Islamists were influence by the nazies.

            the day i learnt about the Europeans hatred for jews, that was the day when i first hated the white europeans. i had always wanted to travel europe and learn about their culture. but now i can see what they really are and theres no more that strong desire to travel there anymore. instead i m in love with jews and israel, just like any other indian. and every indian loves jews because we can understand how great their culture is and that they really are the chosen children  of god. god bless jews and israel.
            <br/>
            also, what these white churchians( people who follow the faith of church)cant ever understand is that the greatest calamity in human history was the birth of churchianity ( beloved the all glorious lord jesus christ can be last thing that fools in church can ever grasp. as i write this my heart melts in gratitude to beloved lord christ for being so merciful as to come in the land of savages, but the purpose of his birth was defeated coz dark forces reacted by creating church, which destroyed almost every advanced society in terms of its spiritual growth and potential and brought back the reign of darkness  ). remember if jews are successful in every walk of life despite all the horrors, its coz they have a culture and evolution.
            <br/>
            what the way of dark forces and what they are. as one becomes aware of these things, then one see the real face of church and society that follows church.
            <br/>
            i am really sorry if i hurt the sentiments of anyone. it was never my intention. but i have written what i feel to be right.

            The Jews were persecuted by Hitler. Thats true. They were innhumanely dealt with in 1920s America. Thats true. What do the Jews want then? We respect their pains, we respect their self- defence, their battling to live and exist. But does this give them the right to ridicule other peoples religions? To deny other peoples rights to live on their ancestors lands (Palestinians) ? Menachem Begin in his book THE REVOLT : THE INSIDE STORY OF THE IRGUN confesses that hatred has been the driving force throughout history. SOME JEWS are humble, understanding and modest. The Prophet Mohammed referred to them when he first came to Mdina. He actually treated many of them with decency. He signed a pact with them which decreed that they will be neutral in times of war between Muslims and the Pagan Arabs. However, the elders of the Jews revoked their promise to him publicly. They sought to assist the Pagans to occupy Medina and slaughter its Muslim inhabitants.It is irrational and provocative to expect Him to give a good treatment to a punch of liars and a traitors, only because they happened to be Jews !! A Muslim who persecutes a Jew or a Christian is punished in Islam as if he has persecuted a fellow Muslim. If a Muslim kills a Jew who did nothing to him, the Muslim is to be executed for his henious guilt. JUSTICE PREVAILS OVER ALL. Now, Israel brings another Holocaust to Palestine. Sorry to say this, but many many many Jews hate people not vice versa

            I see most writers follow what they have been taught to impose them over others, and these writers themselves lack for a lot of knowledge but once they senior up will totally start saying different thing, at that time they wont be believed because they will end up minority by what they did when they were learning.
            <br/>
            Simply if you need the truth about what Quran says, read it , its God book too, God of Jewish, Christians and Muslims, miraculously it talks about a lot of  amazing things, part of it clearly reveals a lot about Jewish history good and bad, also predicts their recent power and future plans, and all educated Muslims believe in that, honestly all the chaos made by Jewish now to make Arabs look bad, deny their history to have a reason why kill, expel and scatter poor Palestinians without public mercy look at what they are doing, Jews say holy land is just theirs, doesnt make sense, it is everybody lands including them, for example can Aboriginal Indians in North America do this to European settlers which are Americans now, absolutely no, think and dig deeper before you judge, it is not a matter of a religion or race, it is a matter of power and money, Media controlled by the to make most people blindly bias to them and their opinion, the majority will follow because it fits their needs too.

            Im not interested in Jews or Muslims. I think theyre all the same, just a different tribe.
            <br/>
            In my personal opinion the idea comes from their extreme belief that they should not do business with anybody not-jewish. Like a clan. Of course, when it is in the clans interest, theyll do their utmost to get a favorable deal, banding together.
            <br/>
            Any deal screwing a Gojim (a not-Jew) and even their other brothers is a fair deal, allowed, and applauded by the clan (e.g. Isaac is a very clever boy).
            <br/>
            Gojims have other things on their minds than screwing people, like nation, family values, law, etc. Jews can only think of wealth.
            <br/>
            Thats why everybody hates Jews.Their complete lack of morality, social, nationalistic and humanitarian adherance and justice.
            <br/>
            I dont know if thats imparted by upbringing or genetic build.

            Whenever Jews had state power, they went on large scale genocide of non jews. Exploits of Abraham, Joshua are there in OT. That may be a major reason why Jews were hated.
           </p>
           <p>
            But a word of caution. Jews lived peacefully and honorably in India and China.

            It is unfortunate that so much that happens with politics in America is for Israel. We murdered more than one million people including women and children in Iraq that was completely unnecessary or a war crime because Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11 and there were no weapon of mass destruction. The American people are aware that going into Iraq made no sense at all for retribution and pounced on Bush for years over this, but we continue to aid Israel fighting their wars.  Netanyahu actually stated on Fox News let the American troops die for Israel instead of Israeli troops.  The Jew lobby in Washington is so powerful that it is as if our whole agenda is to help Israel.  We now know that Israel is up to their neck in blame for the bombing of the WTC on 9-11-2001.  This can be proven by who benefited the most from that event that took the lives of over 3,000 New Yorkers who were civilians just going to work that day. Building 7 was all to telling that these buildings were prepared in advance to detonate and crumble to disintegrations in seconds.  Larry Silverstein the new owner of asbestos contaminated buildings was heard in a television interview to that he himself said to pull it. an expression that used in demolishment of buildings. This was not the first time Israel attacked Americans for their own benefit.  The USS Liberty was bombed by Israel, killing and injuring hundreds of our troops with the intent to blame it on Egypt. According to the Talmud the Jewish Bible along with the 1st Testament Bible, the Talmud encourages the Jew to deceive the Goyam (the Christian) . What kind of religion would encourage evil?

            It is Egotistical to call/recognize yourself as a Chosen People, and not expect to have a Backlash How fucking Moronic, is that?! The latter details, only proves my point. If the US hadnt backed these BloodsuckingAssholes in the 7 day War, there would never have been a 9/11. Fuck the Jews! Let them fight their own MOFO battles. They love to Cry Anti-Semitism, yet these fuckers are the most Racists Assholes Weve ever known in NYC, cant speak for other places, though Ive been told the same. Youre Chosen alright Hate (No, I dont!) to tell you, not for the Better. Good Ridance, BeanHead.
