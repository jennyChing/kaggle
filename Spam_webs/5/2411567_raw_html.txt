         Melbournes top chefs and restaurateurs believe theres no other city in the world that can boast the diversity and quality of Melbournes food and wine. Its a community spoilt for choice. The city of Melbourne has embraced cultures and flavours from around the world, creating a varied, competitive and vibrant food and wine industry. So, prepare to loosen your purse strings  and your belt buckle  to take your taste buds on a memorable journey.
        </p>
        <p>
         An abundance of cafes, bars, restaurants and food halls can be found in almost every block in the city. The Crown Melbourne complex, on the banks of the Yarra River, is a short stroll from the CBD and home to fine-dining restaurants such as Neil Perrys Rosetta Ristorante, Spice Temple and Rockpool, as well as Heston Blumenthals The Fat Duck.
        </p>
        <p>
         Speaking of fine-dining, Shannon Bennetts Vue de monde is situated in the heart of the business precinct, 55 levels above ground in the iconic Rialto Building on Collins Street. Bennett has employed cold kitchen technology, which means no exposed flames or gas, and also an e-water system - all part of his sustainable food philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Queuing for a table is common practice in Melbourne for the hot-right-now venues. Reservations are not accepted at these places. Perching yourself at a bar or crouching in a stairwell are becoming part of the dining experience. Chin Chin, Supernormal, and Mamasita in the CBD are all mid-priced options with top quality food (if you can afford the wait). Tables at Kong and Baby in Richmond are also in demand.
        </p>
        <p>
         For a taste of China look no further than the corner of Swanston and Little Bourke Streets in the city. Be transported to another part of the world as you stroll down Chinatown and the cobblestone laneways that branch off it. It is down one of these laneways  Market Lane  that youll find the renowned Flower Drum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditional Asian style Karaoke bars can also be found in this part of town if you fancy a song after supper.
        </p>
        <p>
         Theres no surprise Australias number one restaurant voted by
         <em>
          Gourmet Traveller
         </em>
         is in this great city. The decadent Attica Restaurant can be found in a suburban setting fifteen minutes from Melbourne. Its been awarded Three Chefs Hats in
         <em>
          The Age Good Food Guide
         </em>
         and is celebrated both nationally and internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
         Restaurant manager Banjo Harris Plane says he relocated to Melbourne from Sydney to work there. There were, and still are, inspirational and exciting things going on at this restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was drawn to Chef Ben Shewry and what he has created. Its honest, real and something he believes in completely. Its not driven by business, its something that supports sustainable farming and something that always focuses on people.

         For patrons, the dining experience is designed to be different. Its the opposite of comfort food. Its food that makes you think, he adds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Were here to open peoples eyes, to entice them to try new flavours and ingredients; new wines. Its also about emotion  connecting people to the food.
        </p>
        <p>
         Atticas chefs have an eye for detail and everything is prepared with precision. They grow their own herbs and food is made fresh everyday. We dont set ourselves any boundaries in terms of creativity. We push as hard as we can to make things as amazing as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Popular chef, media personality and food identity, Guy Grossi, has also dedicated his life to cooking, and has built an empire of successful restaurants in Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
         He raves about this city as a hub for foodies.
        </p>
        <p>
         You couldnt count the cuisines in a day, the variety is stunning, he says.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course he believes everyone should experience the authenticity of the Grossi offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
         We treat ingredients with the utmost respect, he explains. Its about simplicity, sourcing local produce from local farmers  the philosophy of using something from your own backyard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Grossi Florentino is his flagship restaurant, situated on Bourke Street, in the heart of the city. The grill is on the ground floor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its a smart, Tuscan-inspired grill  the perfect pre, or post, theatre venue, Grossi explains.
        </p>
        <p>
         Upstairs has a more upmarket feel, steeped in Italian tradition complete with murals depicting sixteenth century life in Florence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Cellar Bar is simple and easy. It opens at 7.30am and closes late.
        </p>
        <p>
         You get this wonderful crowd that develops throughout the day, Grossi says. Im very tempted some days to just sit down with the patrons.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ombra Salumi Bar is located next door. It focuses on the act of preserving things. Described by Grossi as moody and groovy, you cant go past ordering a pizza with dough that has been fermented for 48 hours to create that puffy crispness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another Grossi venue is Merchant, located in the business district on Collins Street. Venetian-inspired, it has a different feel to the restaurant and is more relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
         On a cobblestone alley off Flinders Lane in the CBD is Coda
         <em>
          .
         </em>
         A dining setting suitable to many, it was established by Chef Adam DSylva nearly six years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its a fun experience, with great service, a high standard of food. Its not stuffy or pretentious, he explains.

         He says its the same at his other Indian-inspired restaurant Tonka, nestled at the end of yet another laneway, in what used to be Melbournes famous Honkytonks bar.
        </p>
        <p>
         DSylva is a big believer in visitors experiencing a range of dining options while in Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
         Were just doing amazing things here, he says enthusiastically. The culture and diversity is incredible. We use produce from all around the world. Our chefs are talented and multi-skilled, and many us of bring a wealth of knowledge from around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         He recommends trying the Vietnamese soup pho on Victoria Street in Richmond, and having yum cha in the suburbs, although he does conclude that at the end of the day, the city is the place to be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Grossi echoes this sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Melbourne is such an eclectic place now, were so culturally rich, he says, pointing out other enclaves, like Greville Street in Prahran, are also worth exploring.

         Its no wonder this is where foodies from all over the globe gather for the annual Melbourne Food and Wine Festival. More than 20 years since its inception, the Festival now hosts over 200 events. Its a chance to sample a range of restaurant delights, explore venues around the state  from city rooftops to regional cellar doors  and learn more about the creations of some of Australias leading chefs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Events run all year round but the main festival is on between February 27 and March 15.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to Guy Grossi, you can enjoy great food and hospitality in Melbourne any time.
        </p>
        <p>
         We, in the industry, welcome people to come. We just love looking after them.
        </p>
        <p>
         So pack your bags and some loose fitting pants and come on down.

         Theres no denying that Melbourne is the fashion and shopping capital of Australia. Retail in this great city is expanding, with major international brands selecting Melbourne to open their flagship stores.

         You dont have to book a seat by the runway to view top fashion. Take a walk down some of the popular shopping strips for a taste of style and diversity. Melburnians arent afraid to express themselves through fashion, and along each strip youll notice different trends, from preppy sophistication, to retro grunge. Superb cafes abound in these areas and provide not only a much-needed pick-me-up, but also the perfect viewing platform for the colourful passing parade.
        </p>

         One Melbourne identity who has been observing from close-up is model and popular fashion blogger Nadia Bartel. She has her finger on the pulse when it comes to trends. Melbourne is the fashion hub We just love rocking our own look. For example, you could see a woman with a Yves Saint Laurent handbag with a five dollar top from Cotton On. Thats not something youd necessarily see in other states.
        </p>
        <p>
         She raves about the choice of international labels, but says her loyalty will always lie with local talent. We have so many talented designers here, says Bartel, who just loves shopping in her hometown.

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          "With a truly international feel, wandering the grand walkways of the Emporium makes you get a feeling you could be anywhere in the world."

         Only in Melbourne is one able to walk through from Bourke Street Mall to Emporium to Melbourne Central - a transport hub - linking together the retail heart of the city.

        <p>
         The CBD offers the largest selection of department stores, international retailers and boutiques, with several city blocks dedicated to housing all the big names. Melbourne is the premier Australian destination for global brands such as Uniqlo and H&amp;M. Chanel opened its largest boutique in Australia on Russell Street, Italian label Dolce &amp; Gabbana welcomed its first Australian store on Collins Street, British Brand Paul Smith chose to launch its first Australian stand-alone store on Collins St, and Japanese retail giant Muji opened its first Australian store at Chadstone.

         The GPO on the corner of Elizabeth and Bourke Streets is home to H&amp;M, while adjacent Bourke Street Mall houses high-street names like Zara and Sportsgirl, as well as flagship department stores for both David Jones and Myer. These buildings are now connected via a glass overpass to the sparkling new Emporium building, linking almost 1000 shops within two city blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of these shops can be found on a wander through the grand walkways of Emporium. This multi-level shopping hub, which opened last year, has a bit of everything: technology, clothes, shoes and much more. Not only does it house the big, internationally-acclaimed stores, but local designers are also featured prominently in Emporium. The second floor is home to Melbourne designers such as Scanlan and Theodore, Gorman, Godwin Charli, Arthur Galan, 124 Shoes, Mr Simple and Autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         After hours of browsing the wide variety of shops, youll probably want to grab a quick bite to refuel, or sit down with a nice meal. Thankfully, there are expansive food offerings in the 'food court' area on the third floor, such as Jimmy Grants, New Shanghai and Earl Canteen, as well as many other cuisine options on each level. Emporium's impressive food court features premium "fast food" delights, as well as craft beers and delicious delicacies.

         Emporium also connects to Melbourne Central, a shopping centre with all the staples and the historic Shot Tower and charming clock which chimes every hour.

        <p>
         Outside the walls of the main centres and department stores lies an organised grid of laneways, jam-packed with boutiques, cafes and quaint eateries. Flinders Lane, Little Collins Street, the Block Arcade and Degraves Street offer a completely different feel to the manufactured bright lights of the main shopping centres. Stop to browse the tiny stores, and stay to admire the street art by some of the worlds greats while sipping on a perfectly crafted flat white.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the CBD offers a little taste of everything, its worth venturing beyond the hustle and bustle to explore some quintessentially Melbourne shopping districts, each with something different to offer.

         A short tram ride away, just over two kilometres from the city, are Brunswick and Gertrude Streets in Fitzroy. Funky, eclectic, chic and individuality broadly encapsulates this area.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the neighbouring suburb of Collingwood, Smith Street is the home of vintage. A variation on the funky theme in Fitzroy, this is a favourite hang out for hipsters, and has quickly become a go-to for hot new restaurants and bars. This is the strip for furniture, retro treads and art, such as Australian Galleries showing prints from artists including Jeffrey Smart, Arthur Boyd and Brett Whiteley. Theres a definite vibe that this is

         Cosmopolitan Chapel Street in South Yarra is on the other side of the river and easily accessible by tram or train. This strip passes through three suburbs and is almost impossible to tackle the entire length in one day. Celebrities and sporting heroes are often spotted trotting down this stylish street, or sitting perched at one of the streets great cafes, sipping on a Long Mac. This is one of Nadia Bartels favourite spots to shop: I love the range and diversity. Youve got Australian brands like Scanlan and Theodore, Arthur Galan and Manning Cartell, and then youve got a store like Green with Envy that has a fantastic range of international designers.

         Daylesford and the nearby town of Hepburn Springs are home to 80 per cent of all mineral water springs in Australia. The area has been attracting visitors keen to experience its restorative properties for over a century.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first Mineral Springs Reserve was founded in 1865. These springs also enrich the soil, meaning theres plenty of high quality local produce grown in the area ready to be sampled at many of the regions markets, cafes and restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of these is Kazukis, an authentic Japanese venue in the heart of Daylesford. When asked why its so popular, head chef and owner Kazuki joked, Why? Because of me!
        </p>
        <p>
         Born in Akita in Japan, Kazuki has grown to love this part of the world and all that it has to offer. He and wife Saori have created a happy place for staff and patrons alike. Moreton Bay bug dumplings are his signature dish.

         However, its not just the culinary delights that attract visitors. Natural wonders abound, with Lake Daylesford, the Wombat Hill Botanic Gardens and the mysterious and mystical Hanging Rock all very popular among visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
         The spectacular rock was formed by an upheaval of lava millions of years ago, but made famous by the novel and movie

         Natural beauty isnt the only thing that attracts visitors. The regions Swiss Italian heritage also lends itself to striking architecture. Lavandula is a mixed farm with a traditional European feel. The cluster of farmhouse buildings dates back to the 1860s. It was originally a dairy farm, but today there are lavender fields, olive and chestnut groves, a vineyard and an ancient volcano in the distance. Within the grounds lies La Trattoria Caf, where visitors can sit under the ash trees and enjoy the rustic Swiss Italian inspired food. While the menu is European inspired, scones, biscuits and preserves are made fresh on site and served daily. The property also offers contemporary accommodation.
        </p>
        <p>
         A visit to this region would not be complete without a dip in the rejuvenating and healing waters of mineral spas. There are a number of bathing options on offer.
        </p>
        <p>
         If youve got a few days to relax and unwind, Peppers Mineral Springs Retreat offers the whole package. The boutique hotel has a range of accommodation options including your very own Springs Room and private villas. There are eleven spa treatment rooms, eight dedicated to special couples treatments, and each therapist offers individual healing techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to spa manager Fiona Craig, people can arrive stressed - but then eventually feel calmer and quieter.
        </p>
        <p>
         The spa offers a unique experience for visitors, and if youre game to try them, there are four special water beds.
        </p>
        <p>
         You stay dry and can have a massage or have mud applied, then, at the push of a button, the bed is filled and youre cocooned with warm water. Its womb-like. Youre completely weightless, Ms Craig explains.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although guests can still experience the relaxation benefits after a forty-five minute treatment, a bathing routine followed by a spa session is highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         We get a lot of comments about the products we use. Many of the ingredients are local, indigenous products many people havent been exposed to, Ms Craig says.
        </p>
        <p>
         The setting also contributes to the mood of the spa.
        </p>
        <p>
         Youre brought back to nature, she explains. We try and match our guests to therapists. Youre taken to a state where youre almost sleeping, but youre not. Youre being tended to and all your senses are being stimulated and activated, but in a really gentle way. Needless to say, treatments are in high demand and bookings are recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Lake House is another picturesque retreat where guests can switch off and unwind. Celebrated foodie and owner Alla Wolf-Tasker said her role is to tease out individual wants and then deliver.

        <p>
         The spa has been designed with blonde wood, has ten treatment rooms, waterfall-fed streams, and an extensive menu of treatment packages. Visitors can simply base themselves at the Lake House for a few days and escape.

         Once youre feeling adequately rejuvenated, its time to eat again. Chat to Georgie Patterson for a unique experience. Shes a local identity who has set her sights on demystifying the truffle. She runs Aussie Truffle Dogs, a business dedicated to growing, harvesting and selling truffles. As a dog breeder with 25 years experience, she turned her hand from training dogs to harvesting truffles about a decade ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its really left-field; something totally different. We have a varied group of people come through, she explains. Some are foodies, some just love dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
         They allow visitors to be involved in the process and delight in educating people about truffles.
        </p>
        <p>
         People shouldnt be scared by truffles. Its not that difficult to work with and its not as elite and as expensive as people think.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its also not for everyday use, but is great for something special.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ms Patterson advises people book ahead, and she tailors packages to suit individual needs. She has seven very social, happy dogs. Harvesting is only possible for 12 weeks of the year from early June until late August. Visitors going out to harvest should be prepared for a cold walk through the paddock.
        </p>
        <p>
         With so much to offer, its no wonder locals refer to the region as the ultimate getaway. Alla Wolf-Tasker is the first to sing its praises: Originally an area of volcanoes, the resulting extremely fertile soils have spawned a wonderful local viticulture industry and many sustainable artisan farms  producing some of Australias most highly awarded produce and wines.

         Just over an hour drive from Melbourne, the Mornington Peninsula is a picturesque, seaside getaway boasting much to see and do. Surrounded by Port Phillip Bay to the west, Bass Strait to the south and Western Port to the east, the diverse region is home to award-winning wineries and restaurants, top quality local produce and breathtaking natural scenery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sunny seaside villages including Red Hill, Sorrento and Flinders, showcase local produce, local creations, and offer friendly cafes and restaurants. Along the coast youll find stunning beaches with quaint, brightly painted bathing boxes that have been drawing visitors for over a century. There are eight hundred and fifty in total from Mount Eliza all the way down to Portsea. There is a range of diverse local industries set up in the area.Successful horse trainers, artists, wine makers and farmers have made a home among the spectacular bushland, national parks and mineral hot springs.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those who enjoy the great outdoors, theres a long list of activities to participate in and several natural wonders to admire. Cape Schanck in the National Park is at the southern tip of the peninsula. The dramatic volcanic features, sheer cliffs and wild, rocky beaches can be explored by walking along the wooden paths and scenic tracks. For beach lovers theres fishing, snorkelling, sailing, surfing and paddle boarding. Onshore in the hinterland, visitors can hike across countless tracks suitable for various fitness levels, hire a bike and go mountain climbing, get lost and found again in a maze, saddle up for a horse ride or play a round, or several, of golf. There are more than fifteen championship golf courses including The Flinders Golf Club, Moonah Links Golf Club and RACV Cape Schank  so pack your clubs and after a long day on the fairway you can stroll directly to onsite accommodation at the picturesque Peppers Moonah Links Resort or RACV Cape Schank Resort.
        </p>
        <p>
         Culture also abounds in this diverse pocket of the state. Art enthusiasts can visit artists in their studios and see them work. The Cook Street Collective in Flinders features work from several local identities including jewellery, woodwork, sculpture, furniture, prints, paintings and photographs.
        </p>
        <p>
         For something unique, the Gordon Studio Glassblowers is also worth seeing. Husband and wife Eileen Gordon and Grant Donaldson create vibrant platters, vases and bowls. Visitors might also be lucky enough to watch the glassblowing process through a mezzanine floor.

         The Mornington Peninsula, with its natural beauty and diversity, provides a rich, fertile ground for growing and harvesting local produce. Its not difficult to stumble upon a farm gate, a bakery or cellar door while travelling around, or visitors can purchase fresh produce from a roadside stall. The Main Ridge Dairy, Green Olive and Sunnyridge Strawberry Farm are popular pit stops.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you do stumble upon a cellar door you are likely to encounter pinot noir, the regions most celebrated drop. The region is home to premium producers such as Port Philip Estate as well boutique wineries, which offer more intimate surrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Foxeys Hangout is one such boutique. A place to relax, drink wine, eat food and chat to the brothers behind the successful vineyard, Michael and Tony.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its a simple version of a fancy degustation in a noisy bar-type setting, overlooking the vineyard, says Tony.
        </p>
        <p>
         The brothers started in finance - Tony was a stock-broker and Michael a banker. As young men in their twenties they went on a sailing trip and, over a few beers, decided they both hated what they were doing and agreed to open a caf. Over the past three decades theyve owned four restaurants, establishing Foxeys in 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tony, also a chef, takes care of the food and wine making, while Michael works on the vineyard. According to Tony: It works because were different people, we agree on almost nothing - but the sum of the parts is greater than the individual components, and we get along famously.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the pair believes wine is great fun, they take wine making very seriously and go as far as calling it an obsession. Theyve won 16 trophies in wine shows over the past five years, most recently awarded Best Pinot Noir and Best Wine in the Mornington Peninsula Wine Show.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the Mornington Flinders Road in Main Ridge are three vineyards rolled into one winery. Aptly named Ten Minutes by Tractor, the vineyards all have different properties. The varied soil, climate, and sunlight all contribute to the wide array of flavours produced by each vineyard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chef Stuart Bell has been running the business for the past eight years and says, you can pop in for a tasting at the cellar door or you can stay for hours. Sit down and enjoy our delicious eight course degustation with a selection of wines to match.
        </p>
        <p>
         The restaurant boasts an award winning wine list and received two hats from the Age Good Food Guide in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

         In nearby Red Hill is Maxs Restaurant. Max Paganoni was born and raised on the Peninsula in Tyabb. At the age of 20, as a qualified chef, he spread his wings and travelled to Europe. In the early nineties he stumbled upon a man working on a property and vineyard in Red Hill. He suggested a one-hundred-seat restaurant would work well. In 1994 Maxs was complete and ready for business. Over the years Max acquired more of the land and now runs the 42-acre property. He raves about the view: You look over the vineyard at our pinot and chardonnay and then over the ocean. Its amazing. A lot of people come just for the view and then end up staying for more.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hes also a passionate advocator for the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Peninsula has its own micro climate and an amazing diversity of things to do. Bush walks are underestimated here. Its a one-stop-shop and everything is within a 45 minute drive.
        </p>
        <p>
         This cultured seaside escape can be enjoyed at any time of the year and there are activities for all weather conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Peninsula Hot Springs has sweeping views of the ocean looking out over Bass Straight, while in the foreground the natural beauty of indigenous trees complete the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its a blissfully relaxing experience you can enjoy all year round in any weather condition, says Charles Davidson, manager and owner.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are thirty different bathing experiences, so there really is something for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Charles has dedicated the past twenty years to researching bathing practices around the world. Hes been to more than thirty countries and has incorporated what hes learnt into his business.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can have four generations sitting in the one pool. Its rare to find an activity that everyone in the family can enjoy and participate in.
        </p>
        <p>
         Visitors can simply enjoy the water, or indulge in reflexology walks and traditional spa treatments. When people leave, Charles says they all Walk out with a sparkle, looking relaxed and re-energized.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thermal waters help calm [and] certain minerals in the water help health, healing and the overall state of relaxation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bookings are essential on weekends and public holidays, and are highly recommended during the week to avoid disappointment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Visitors to the region have a range of accommodation options including B&amp;Bs, boutique hotels, large family beach houses for rent, vineyard villas, and luxurious resorts. Theres something to suit all budgets. For a tranquil and romantic getaway, the Ellisfiled Farm Bed and Breakfast, Polperro Villas and Big Blue Backyard are perfect for couples.

         A stones throw from Melbourne is an idyllic hideaway with fertile soil, rolling hills and mountain ash forests. It takes just 50 minutes by road to get to the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges, and it is well worth a visit.

         The region is not only famous for world-class wines - its a natural food bowl, where fruit and vegetables are grown in abundance and where cheese, artisan chocolates and preserves are all masterfully created.
        </p>
        <p>
         These simple pleasures can be found in the quaint villages of Sassafras, Olinda and Healesville. Surrounded by mountains, forests and wineries these townships are bustling hubs of local business worth exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Healesville Hotel is a classic country hotel serving outstanding food and wine. Theres plenty to see so book at night at the hotel or if you are after more luxurious surrounds visit Furmston House, adjacent to the hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nearby youll find quality coffee at Healesville Harvest. Seasonal ingredients are used to create fresh meals perfect to consume while on the go or in the cafs garden. For meat, cheese and hampers, K&amp;B (Kitchen and Butcher) is the ideal spot to purchase fresh produce to serve with local wine.
        </p>
        <p>

         , climbing up and down the historic Thousand Steps, or trekking through the ferns to marvel at Keppel Falls.
        </p>
        <p>
         But perhaps the thing that brings people back again and again is the regions stunning wine country renowned for its chardonnay and sparkling wines. Numerous companies offer tours from the city, often including tastings and lunch.

         Its proximity to Melbourne is such a feature, you travel for fifty minutes, go over the hill  and youre in the Yarra Valley, says Matt Noble from The Australian Wine Tour Co.

         His company has been operating for 16 years. Matt explains how they hire their drivers: We find charismatic wine lovers and then teach them how to drive a bus. They make the day, and really ensure guests enjoy themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are plenty of places to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
         The famous winery De Bortoli is always a favourite and boasts some of the oldest plantings in the region. They produce a range of wines to suit every palate and pocket and are popular with visitors.

         Named after a busy Melbourne thoroughfare, Punt Road Vineyards wines are a lot more enjoyable than the time Melbournians spend in gridlock on its namesake.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also worth a look is Dominique Portet winery, a small family business run by Ben Portet. Im a tenth-generation wine maker, he explains. Were originally from France, so our wines have a French twist.
        </p>
        <p>
         Guests who walk through their cellar door gain an education with every tasting: We cater for people with all levels of wine knowledge  we never assume.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a lot of international visitors and weve learnt different cultures like various smells and flavours. We try to embrace them all.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dominique Portet specialises in a dry, European-style rose, but they also do a variety of blends.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tradition is also big for us, Ben explains. Its just little things that have been passed on from generation to generation. We blend a lot to make a unique wine. We do it over a long time, and with extreme care. As the year progresses we add different flavours.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another family-owned winery is Oakridge. Operating for more than three decades, they pride themselves on being grape farmers, and believe their specialty is creating true table wines that outperform their price-points. These farmers refrain from intervention where possible, and keep pumping, plunging, racking and filtration to a minimum.
        </p>

         Wine is also a family affair at TarraWarra Estate. All wines are estate grown and made on the property. Winemaker Clare Halloran says, Were well known for our exceptional pinot noir and chardonnay. But we have many other varieties, some only available from our cellar door. We always have older vintages available too. The estate sits on four hundred acres of farmland. Theres an upmarket restaurant, and a newly built deck for a more casual experience. Its the perfect area to sit, snack and have a glass of wine under the shade of the peppercorn trees, according to Halloran. Tarrawarra is also home to the TarraWarra Museum of Art showcasing primarily Australian from the 1950s to today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps the best-known of all the Yarra Valley wineries is one with a distinctly French association. French champagne house Moet &amp; Chandon established their Yarra Valley winery in 1986. Domaine Chandon sparkling wines are created with the same techniques used in the Champagne region of France. Methode traditionnelle wines are made from chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier grape varieties, with the Yarra Valley providing the perfect cool climate and soil for Chandon winemakers.

         But the region isnt just for the wine-lover. The Napoleone family has been growing apples and stone fruits here for 67 years. Initially the Napoleone brothers sold their fruit to other wineries, but they now have their own successful range of pear and apple ciders available at Napoleone Brewery and Ciderhouse.

         Napoleone shares the district with Meletos, a series of reconstructed and refurbished century old farm buildings. On site you can relax at the caf in the morning, take to the gourmet pizzeria for dinner and then full of pizza heave yourself into one of the boutique guest rooms in The Farmhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
         If beer is your thing then you'll also want to visit the Hargreaves Hill microbrewery, situated just below the hill it was named. The brewery has endured its fair share of challenges  in 2009 it was destroyed in the Black Saturday fires. For six months, the beer was brewed elsewhere while the new brew house was built in Lilydales Cavehill Industrial Estate. Since then it has produced Pale Ale, Hefeweizen and Stout. Visitors can enjoy their tipple outdoors, sipping on a large variety of beers on tap in the garden surrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another great spot to stop is Coldstream Brewer. No longer brewing on site, instead the team focuses on serving quality beers, cider and top-notch pub food. All produce is sourced from Victoria and they assure visitors everything has been taste-tested many times over so its up to scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you plan to indulge a little too much, you might want to think about spending the night in the Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chateau Yering might just be what you need  it offers exceptional food and luxury five-star accommodation in a historic homestead.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its the best way to experience quality food in the wine country. You just stroll back to your room after dinner and collapse, says executive chef Mathew Macartney.

         Their signature dish at present is eggplant tofu with asparagus, local radishes and carrots, goats curd, ash bread and olive oil, although the menu changes regularly depending on the season and produce availability.
        </p>
        <p>
         For somewhere with a bit more solitude head to Gracedale where contemporary luxury suites offer spa baths, king beds and sweeping panoramic views of the Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
         But to completely appreciate the landscape of undulating hills and manicured vineyards, the Yarra Valley is best viewed from above. A number of companies offer hot air balloon rides and packages. But youd better be an early riser  most require passengers to meet an hour or so before sunrise!

         All flights are dependent on the weather, and it can get chilly, so pack your winter woolies.
