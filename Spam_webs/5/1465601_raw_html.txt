         Yesterday I didnt want to accept the fact that it was actually Monday so Im writing my weekend recap post on Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
         Friday night I did 4 mi on the treadmill @ 8:40 pace. I usually dont run on Fridays, but we didnt have any plans so we just decided to spend our Friday night at the gym. For dinner I made

         On Saturday morning I refused to run on the treadmill, so I woke up way too early and headed to the lake for a run. I forgot my headphones and was running by myself, so I knew it was not going to be fun. Thankfully after about 2.5 miles I ran into my dad and Kara (another way faster than me running friend) and finished up with them. I ended up with a slow 7 miles @ 9:07 pace. I felt like I was running wayyyyy faster, but I guess thats what the heat does to you.

         On Saturday we went to visit with Thomass parents since we werent going to be able to see them on Fathers Day and went to his dads jewelry store to pick out Thomass wedding band. Saturday night we met up with Sarah, Stephanie and her husband Scott for dinner.

         On Sunday we went over to my parents house to see my dad for Fathers Day. My brothers and I got him some Jaybird Bluebud X Wireless headphones for running. Im interested to see how he likes them because Ive been wanting a pair myself, but Im soooo particular about how my running headphones fit my ears and Ive only ever been able to keep Skull Candy headphones in my ears while I run.
        </p>
        <p>
         Monday night was a rest day. We met up with Dara and Matt, our good friends who were with us the night we got engaged. We actually went back to the same restaurant where it all happened!

         Thanks so much for all of your awesome advice and comments on my last post! It makes it a lot easier to think about taking on a marathon when I have all of you to consult on a daily basis. I know every runner is different, but it is beyond helpful to hear all of the different perspectives and experiences. So thanks for being awesome

         It has been HOT here in NC. Like, REALLY, REALLY HOT. It has been in the high 90s every day this week, so Ive been spending my time on the treadmill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tuesday I did an easy 6 miles @ 9:10 pace and Thursday I did 4 miles @ 9:00 pace. I loooove this pace. I know its slow but I dont breathe hard and nothing hurts and I can just watch Orange is the New Black in peace without huffing and puffing. Once training starts Ill start throwing in some tempo runs, but 8:40-9:20 is my jam right now.

         Thursday was an off day because we had our food tasting for our wedding after work. This might be my favorite part of wedding planning so far. I didnt take pictures of everything, but it was all amazing and delicious. We had free beer, sampled hors doeuvres, bread, salad, a vegetarian dish and two main dishes. They gave us really small portions so we wouldnt explode. I honestly would have eaten every bite so Im really glad they forced us to eat smaller plates. It was all SO good and we were very very full when we left.

           cake tasting

         </strong>
         ! Its hard to believe how fast time has flown by since we got engaged last September. I hate how fast time is moving but at the same time I cant wait until our wedding day (79 days!!!!). I really am a lucky girl to be marrying my best friend.

         Monday was an off day, not by choice, but just because we were super busy. We didnt even sit down to eat dinner until 9:45 p.m. and we were
         <strong>
          STARVING
         </strong>
         . We had white chicken enchiladas, YUM.

         After dinnerDixie and I got all caught up on the Bachelorette (Oh heyyyyy Shawn) while Thomas caught up onGame of Thrones. Im kind of mad that Kaitlyn spoiled the winner with her snapchat slip up, but Im kind of happy that it was exactly who I wanted it to be.

         Over the past few days Ive been putting some serious thought into my fall marathon training. For a first time marathoner, a lot of advice is focused on not settinggoals and focusing primarily on mileage  NOT speed. I think thats great advice, and I want to make sure Im smart about training, but I also want to make sure I accomplish something in November.
        </p>
        <p>
         It seems like every training plan has two options  beginner and advanced. Just because it is my first marathon, Im not going to automatically put myself in the beginner category. Ive been running for a LONG time. I understand that the marathon is a totally different race than high school cross country, but I feel like Im educated enough to know when I need to slow down, when I can speed up, and how to avoid getting injured. I am by NO means an expert, but I also wouldnt define myself as a beginner.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to challenge myself, but I dont want to overdo it. I understand how hard this is going to be, but
         <strong>
          I want it to be hard
         </strong>
         . A quote always sticks out in my head that was probably on some corny motivational poster at the gym, but it said something along the lines of if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. I dont want to takethe easi
         <em>
          er
         </em>
         path (no marathon training path is
         <em>
          easy
         </em>
         )just because its the first race. I dont want to set the bar too high either, but I want to set it high enough that I still feeling like Im challenging myself and working towards something.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ive been reading the Hansons Marathon Method and combining aspects of the beginner and advanced plan into a sort of customized plan for myself. I dont think Im going to be able to commit to running 6 days a week throughout the wedding madness and honeymoon time in September, but I want to come up with a realistic and attainable plan that will help me run a good race in November. Im excited to finalize everything and officially get started next month, but Im curious about how everyone else feels about the beginner/advanced training divide and how to approach a semi-experienced runners first marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="color: #0000ff;">
          <strong>
           Do you group yourself into the beginner or advanced category?
          </strong>
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>

         I know Ive been really bad about posting and reading other blogs this past week, but Ive been trying my best to get caught up, so bear with me!

         Well, vacation is officially over. And Im officially depressed. Why does it come and go SO fast? I had an amaaaaaazing week in Nags Head, NC with my whole family (cousins, aunts, uncles, parents, brothers, etc etc). Here is a picture of most of the cousins we were missing two:

         The weather was perfect, our house was oceanfront and awesome, and I could have stayed forever. Some of you may have heard that there were three shark attacks off the coast of NC this week, which is really scary and unusual. These werent anywhere close to us and happened after we left, so I spent a lot of time in the ocean. We saw tons of dolphins and actually saw a WHALE really close to shore that was jumping out of the water. That was a first for me.
        </p>
        <p>
         I always look forward to our family beach week for many reasons, one of which would be the fact that there is food galore. My whole family LOVES to eat. And drink. I think I gained about 5 pounds on this vacation. BUT, I also ran 27 miles last week, which is the most weekly mileage I have done in a very, very long time. For some reason I find it easy to wake up and run in the morning while Im on vacation, but I couldnt imagine doing such a thing while Im at home. Maybe its because I know I dont have to do anything but sit around and get tan for the rest of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
         We got home Saturday afternoon, so I met up with my dad and the Kernersville Running Club for a 7 mile run on Sunday morning. It was HOT and felt terrible. I think I was still in my depressed vacation-is-over mode and was not feeling very motivated at all. The highs have been in the 90s here lately, so Ive accepted the fact that every outdoor run is going to be uncomfortable no matter what time you go. We ended up finishing 7 miles at about 9:00/mi average pace, but my watch was a little off.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, let me fill you in on some not so great Dixie news. Dixie stayed at her usual kennel while we were on vacation, but she had an incident on the first day there. I got a call shortly after dropping her off and they told me she had been attacked by a bigger dog when she was entering the play area. They were extremely apologetic and said the other dog was taken out of the area immediately and isolated from the other dogs and that Dixie was going to be fine, but they were going to take her to the vet as a precaution. Well, a few hours later I got a call from the vet saying she had stitches in two places and a pretty bad bite mark on her neck. I was crying and having a fit and I hadnt even left town yet. I didnt want to risk upsetting her by going to see her and then leaving again, so I just kept telling myself she was going to be fine. Of course I was a crazy dog mom all week.. I called and checked on Dixie almost every day while I was gone and was so desperate to see her on Saturday when we got home. I was so upset to see her wounds I have been spoiling her like crazy and giving her so much love. She seems totally fine, but I know she was probably terrified during her stay.

         Of course Dixie cant run for a while, so shes been enjoying slow walks and lots of rest since we brought her home. She has barely been able to keep her eyes open since she got home Saturday poor baby

         Unfortunately my vacation is flying by but we are getting a lot of good sun and family time in. Wednesday and Thursday I did 4 mile runs It was just way too hot and humid and I wanted to spend less time running and more time on the beach.

         This week we are on vacation in Nags Head, NC. Ive gotten some good running in the last two days I love getting up early on vacation and running on the flat road that runs along the beach. Monday was a nice long 8 miles and Tuesday was a shorter, slightly slower 4 miler.

        <p>
         I have never been a morning runner, or a morning person for that matter, but on vacation its so easy for me to wake up at 7 am and have energy for a run.

         Ive been really excited about this product for a while and Im excited to finally share my review with you guys. Last month, Tiux sent me a pair of their compression socks to review. I had already been using compression socks, but I had never heard of this brand, so I was excited to try them. They sent me these fun pink and yellow socks that match my Brooks Glycerins perfectly!
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         I have totally ditched my old compression socks and have fallen in love with these!! Let me tell you why:
        </p>
        <p>
         1.
         <strong>
          You cant even tell youre wearing them.
         </strong>
         They are super lightweight and you get all the benefits of compression socks without feeling like you are wearing something thick or itchy.
        </p>
        <p>
         2.
         <strong>
          THEY ARE ONLY $35!!!!
         </strong>
         Ive seen compression socks go for upwards of $60 in retail stores. Since Tiux sells directly to the consumer online, they can sell at a lower price and still deliver a high quality product.
        </p>

         3.
         <strong>
          They provide all of the benefits that a great compression sock should.
         </strong>
         I wore these for my first
         <a href="http://www.dixieruns.com/?p=1417" target="_blank">
          half marathon
         </a>
         and my legs felt awesome the whole race.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.dixieruns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FullSizeRender-281.jpg">

         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         They kept my legs feeling fresh and were totally comfortable to wear for the full race. I thought I was going to be hobbling around the next day with sore muscles, but my legs felt 100% fine. Here are some of the benefits listed on the Tiux website:

         After work today Thomas and I areheading straight to Pittsburgh for a wedding on Saturday and then going straight from there to the Outer Banks for a week at the beach with my family. Last night I felt like I had so much to do after work. I was trying to do laundry, clean the house and get all of my stuff packed up and then I remembered we weregoing to have to take Dixie to doggie camp in the morning. She was giving me this face while I was packing my suitcase:

         I always say that Dixie has separation anxiety, but I think I have it just as bad. I take her to an awesome doggie day care that lets all the dogs play together outside so they are happy and tired at the end of each day. If you REALLY love your dog you can pay extra for a penthousewith a TV or a slumber party with other dogs and an employee literally sleeps in a bed in a room full of dogs. Better yet, they give you access to their live video feed so you can check in on your pup whenever you want.
        </p>
        <p>
         So yes, Im the crazy dog mom that almost criedwhen I took my dog to camp this morning. I call it camp because it sounds fun and the word kennel scares me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Besidesthe fact that Im going to be Dixieless for the next 7 days, I am so excited about this weekend and next week!!! One of my best friends from college is getting married and then I get to be with my crazy big fun family at the beach. Yay

         Thursday was national running day and we FINALLY got a break from the heat and humidity. I took that as a sign that I was going to have a good run. Its crazy how amazing 65 degrees feels after youve been running in the 80s for a few weeks.

         I feel like a lot of people were really excited about National Running Day yesterday and I loved it. Running has grown SO much in popularity over the past few years, and I love seeing people who are learning to love it. This tweet from Bart Yasso is so true and explains what makes running so special.

         A few days ago,
         <a href="http://www.blogaboutrunning.com/" target="_blank">
          Kristina
         </a>
         tagged me to take a blogger survey. Thisone was really random and fun (thanks Kristina)! So, here we go:
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <span style="color: #ff0080;">
           1. What is something people might be surprised to learn about you?
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Im scared of everything. Shadows, noises, heights, sharks, airplanes, snakes, spiders, strangers, everything. If someone tries to jump out and scare me (Thomas thinks this is hilarious) I will instantly go into the fetal position and cry. I usually cant even watch the news because Ill have nightmares and when previews for scary movies come on I have to close my eyes and plug my ears. The last scary movie I remember seeing was The Others (2001) and I left early in tears.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="color: #ff0080;">
          <strong>
           2. Have you ever met anyone famous?
          </strong>
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         I took a tequila shot with Hines Ward when I was in college, does that count?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <span style="color: #ff0080;">
           3. What is something you hope will never come back in style?
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The denim on denim on denim look. I know chambray dresses are really popular right now, and Im okay with that, but too much denim drives me crazy.

          <strong>
           4. What is one place on your travel must-see bucket list?
          </strong>
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Greece. Ive ALWAYS wanted to go to Greece. Maybe it had something to do with watching Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants too many times when I was younger.
        </p>
        <p>

          <strong>
           5. Who would you want to play you in a movie of your life?
          </strong>
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Blake Lively, 100% hands down. Shes perfect. Another Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants issue, perhaps. Im definitely more Bridget and less Serena Van Der Woodsen (any GG fans?!).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <span style="color: #ff0080;">
           6. Who is your favorite Disney princess?
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Im not a big princess person I grew up with two older brothers, so I liked what they liked, and they liked Ninja Turtles.

           7. What would you sing at karaoke night?
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Shania Twain songs are sooooo great for karaoke. And it helps that I already know all of the lyrics.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="color: #ff0080;">
          <strong>
           8. Who would you want to be stranded with on a deserted island?
          </strong>
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thomas, for sure. And hopefully we could have Dixie with us too. Hes good at building stuff and he watches a lot of Doomsday Preppers so I think having him with me would be beneficial to my survival.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <span style="color: #ff0080;">
           9. What is your biggest pet peeve?
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Mouth breathing and any kind of food/eating noise there is nothing worse than listening to someone eat a banana, except maybe listening to a mouth breather eat a banana.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <span style="color: #ff0080;">
           10. What clothing item/accessory/shoes do you have way too many of in your closet?
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         I actually just took 3 full trash bags full of clothes to Goodwill. Im a total clothes hoarder, but if I had to pick one thing I would say I have too many bathing suits. I seriously think I have bikinis from when I was 15 still in my closet. Also, I might have too many pairs of running shoes. Whenever I buy new ones I never seem to throw the old ones away
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <span style="color: #0000ff;">
           Pick one question to answer!!

         I cant believe its already Wednesday! Im so glad this week is going by quickly because I am going to the beach with my family for a week starting on Sunday. I havent taken a vacation day yet this year, so I am sooooo ready to sit on the beach and do nothing for a week straight.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Monday Thomas bought me a 60 min hot stone massage and it was AMAZING. I usually just get the regular relaxation massage, but the hot stones were seriously worth the extra cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tuesday I was ready to run after work because it was only 80 degrees (its been high 80s/low 90s for the past week or so here), but the humidity was intense. I forgot my headphones so I had to run without music, which never works out well.
        </p>
        <p>
         As soon as I started I knew it was going to be a bad run. It felt like I was wearing 10 pound ankle weights, so I stopped after 3.1 miles (8:40 pace) and called it a day. I ran right after work because I didnt want to get caught in the thunderstorms that were supposed to roll through later in the day. Well, Im really glad I didnt get caught in this storm. I have never heard so much noise from a storm before. I thought it was a tornado, so Dixie and I went into the bathroom in the middle of the house while Thomas was out in the garage taking videos totally safe. Dixie usually doesnt get scared of thunder and lightning but we learned yesterday that she DOES NOT like hail. She was in my lap the whole time and wouldnt even step outside after it stopped.

         For anyone who doesnt know, today is NATIONAL RUNNING DAY! No excuses today, just go run. Im linking up with

         </a>
         to talk about. you guessed it,
         <strong>
          running
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Right now, I run because
          </strong>
          It makes me
          <strong>
           happy
          </strong>
          . There isnt one particular reason why I run, but in general, I just cant live without it. If I take two days off in a row I go a little crazy. This might be the healthiest addiction ever

          <strong>
           I started running because
          </strong>
          I was fast. When I was younger, it was all about winning. I remember winning at middle school track meets and feeling on top of the world. Then it became more challenging in high school and I didnt love it as much because I didnt get first place in every race. I was still good, but I wasnt the best. Now Ive found a deeper appreciation for running beyond just winning races.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           When I dont run
          </strong>
          I dont feel like myself. I feel like running is a part of who I am and I really cant imagine giving it up unless Im forced to.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           One thing that running has taught me is
          </strong>
          I can do hard things.

           Hanna
          </a>
          reminded me of this before my half marathon and this kind of stuck with me. If I can run a hard race, I can do other hard things in life too.

           My favorite kind of run is

           a run with Dixie! She is the best running partner and I feel like she loves it just as much as I do.
