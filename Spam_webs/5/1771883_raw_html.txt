      </h3>
      This is a collection of various useful and interesting schematics.  Some
of these are also referenced by or included in other documents at this site.
Some are my own designs while many have been reverse engineered from commercial
equipment.  Many are the sorts of circuits you won't find in any textbook or

        Safety Considerations
       </a>
      </h3>
      Some of these circuits operate at extremely lethal voltage and current levels.
The energy storage capacitors in even the smallest disposable camera
flash operating from a 1.5 V AA battery can be deadly under the wrong
conditions.  Line powered devices - including little ones - may have an added
danger of high power at high voltage AND are often non-isolated (no power
transformer).  Do not attempt to troubleshoot, repair, or modify such equipment
without understanding and following ALL of the relevant safety guidelines for
high voltage and/or line connected electrical and electronic systems.

        Simple High Voltage Generator

      This basic circuit is capable of supplying up to 30 kilovolts or more
from a low voltage DC source using a flyback (LOPT) transformer salvaged
from a TV or computer monitor.  Typical output with a 12 VDC 2 A power
supply or battery will be around 12,000 V.  Current at full voltage is
typically around 1 to 2 mA.  Higher currents are available but the output
voltage will drop.  At 2 kV, more than 10 mA may be possible depending on
your particular flyback transformer.

      <h3>
       Adjustable High Voltage Power Supply
      </h3>
      This circuit uses a pair of 555 timers to provide variable frequency variable
pulse width drive to an inverter using a flyback transformer salvaged from
a black and white or color TV or computer monitor.  At very
low repetition rates, it will produce individual sparks.  At high rates with
a low uF value high voltage capacitor, the output will essentially be HV DC
with a specific value dependent on input voltage, pulse rate and width, and
load.  None of the component values is critical.  The particular transistor
used for Q2 seemed to be zappier better than a common horizontal output type
but they work as well.
      <p>
       The input voltage can range from about 5 to 24 V.  Using a flyback from a MAC
Plus computer which had its bad primary winding excised, an output of more than
20 kV was possible (though risky since the flyback is probably not rated for
more than about 12 kV) from a 24 VDC, 2 A power supply.  By adjusting the drive
frequency and duty cycle, a wide range of output voltages and currents may
be obtained depending on your load.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the addition of a high voltage filter capacitor (0.08 uF, 12 kV), this
becomes a nice little helium neon laser power supply which operates on 8 to
15 VDC depending on required tube current and ballast resistor.  See the
document:
       <a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lasersam.htm">
        Sam's Laser
FAQ
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The transistor types are not critical.  Those were selected basically because
I had them in my junk box.  A TV or monitor horizontal output transistor (HOT)
should be satisfactory for the chopper but will require good strong drive.
The lower voltage, high current transistor I used (2SD797) has both a higher
current and higher Hfe rating than typical HOTs.  Even a 2N3055 will probably
survive and not be too bad in the performance department.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drive transformer is from a B/W computer monitor (actually a video display
terminal) and has a turns ratio of 4:1 wound on a 5/16" square by 3/8" long
nylon bobbin on a gapped ferrite double E core.  The primary has 80 turns and
the secondary has 20 turns, both of #30 wire.  Make sure you get the polarity
correct: The base of the switching transistor should be driven when the driver
turns on.  You should be able to wind a transformer similar to this in about
10 minutes if a similar size (doesn't need to be exact) core is available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the flyback includes an internal rectifier and/or you are attempting
to obtain the maximum output voltage of a specific polarity, the direction of
drive matters as the largest pulse amplitude is generated when the switching
transistor turns off.  Since flyback transformers are not marked, you will
have to try both possible connections to the drive coil.  Use the one that
produces the higher output voltage for a given set of input conditions (drive
and pulse rate/width).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many variations on this basic circuit are certainly possible.  The dual 555
circuit can be reduced to a single 555 with some loss in flexibility (unless
you use the cute non-standard modification that allow independent adjustment
of the high and low times - left as an exercise for the student).
      </p>
      <p>
       One nice thing about running it at 24 VDC or less (as opposed to line
voltage) is that it is much more difficult to let the smoke out of th
 circuit!  The 5 A power supply I was using shut down on several occasions
due to overcurrent but the only time I blew the chopper transistor was by
accidentally shorting the base to collector.

      .  It has two
      <i>
       negative
      </i>
      outputs of -5.3 kVDC at 0.3 mA
max (output C) and -5.7 kVDC at 0.4 mA max (output T).  I assume these stand
for something like "Corona" and "Transfer" based on their functions.  The two
sections are independent with the only components in common being the power
connector and a filter capacitor.  Each section is based on a TL494
PWM controller IC.  This is the same one used in many/most PC power supplies.
A Web search will quickly locate a datasheet.  Separate enable inputs permit
each voltage to be turned on individually.  All the low voltage circuitry is
exposed with the high voltage circuitry being inside a module filled with red
goop.  I have not yet ungooped it so the circuitry inside the potting is
essentially guessed at this point.  The two sections are on separate
schematic pages which are virtually identical except for part numbers and
a few part values:

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The adjustments on each section are for the current limit, not output voltage
as might be expected.  The output voltage for each section is set by fixed
resistors (one of which is inside the potted HV module).

      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Output C (5.3 kV) is approximately Vref*R101/(R8||(R12+R13)).
       </li>
       <li>
        Output T (5.7 kV) is approximately Vref*R121/(R28||(R32+R33)).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It would be a simple matter to replace R12 or R32 to vary the C or T
output voltages within a modest range (like 4 to 6 kV).  But going
too high is asking for smoke. :)  If pots are used, make sure their
maximum value will limit the output voltage to something reasonable.

      The Harper-Wyman Model 6520 Kool Lite(tm) module is typical of those found in
Jenne-Aire and similar cook-tops.  Input is 115 VAC, 4 mA, 50/60 Hz AC.  C1
and D1 form a half wave doubler resulting in 60 Hz pulses with a peak of about
300 V and at point A and charges C2 to about 300 V through D2.  R2, C3, and
DL1 form a relaxation oscillator triggering SCR1 to dump the charge built up
on C2 into T1 with a repetition rate of about 2 Hz.

       Bug Zapper 1
      </h3>
      You know the type - a purplish light with an occasional (or constant) Zap!
Zap! Zap!  If you listen real closely, you may be able to hear the screams of
the unfortunate insects as well :-).
      <p>
       The high-tech versions consist of a high voltage low current power supply and
fluorescent (usually) lamp selected to attract undesirable flying creatures.
(Boring low-tech devices may just use a fan to direct the insects to a tray of
water from which they are too stupid to be able to excape!)
      </p>
      <p>
       However, these devices are not selective and will obliterate friendly and
useful bugs as well as unwanted pests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a typical circuit:

      This is just a line powered voltage quadrupler.  R1 and R2 provide current
limiting when the strike occurs (and should someone come in contact with the
grid).  The lamp, FL1, includes the fluorescent bulb, ballast, and starter (if
required).  Devices designed for jumbo size bugs (or small rodents) may use
slightly larger capacitors!

      <h3>
       Electronic Air Cleaner HV Generator
      </h3>
      At least I assume this cute little circuit board is for an electronic air
cleaner or something similar (dust precipitator, positive/negative ion
generator, etc.)!  I received the unit (no markings) by mistake in the mail.
However, I did check to make sure it wasn't a bomb before applying power. :-)
      <p>
       This module produces both positive and negative outputs when connected to 115
VAC, 60 Hz line voltage.  Each is about 5 kV at up to around 5 uA.  It is
probably similar to the high voltage power supply in the AirEase(tm) Personal
Space Ionization Air Cleaner from Ion Systems, Inc., a small table top unit.
(Unfortunately, the HV module in the AirEase was totally potted so I could not
determine anything about its internal circuitry.)

      </pre>
      The AC input is rectified by D1 and as it builds up past the threshold of the
sidac (D2, 100 V), SCR1 is triggered dumping a small energy storage capacitor
(C1) through the primary of the HV transformer, T1.  This generates a HV pulse
in the secondary.  In about .5 ms, the current drops low enough such that the
SCR turns off.  As long as the instantaneous input voltage remains above about
100 V, this sequence of events repeats producing a burst of 5 or 6 discharges
per cycle of the 60 Hz AC input separated by approximately 13 ms of dead time.
      <p>
       The LED (IL1) is a power-on indicator. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       The transformer was totally potted so I could not easily determine anything
about its construction other than its winding resistances and turns ratio
(about 1:100).

      The secondary side consists of a voltage tripler for the negative output
(HV-) and a simple rectifier for the positive output (HV+).  This asymmetry is
due to the nature of the unidirectional drive to the transformer primary.
      <p>
       From my measurements, this circuit produces a total of around 10 kV between
HV+ and HV-, at up to 5 uA.  The output voltages are roughly equal plus and
minus when referenced to point B.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume the module would also operate on DC (say, 110 to 150 V) with the
discharges repeating continuously at about 2 kHz.  Output current capability
would be about 5 times greater but at the same maximum (no load) voltage.
(However, with DC, if the SCR ever got stuck in an 'on' state, it would be
stuck there since there would be no AC zero crossings to force it off.  This
wouldn't be good!)
      </p>
      <p>
       The secondary side circuitry can be easily modified or redesigned to provide
a single positive or negative output or for higher or lower total voltage.
Simply removing R4 will isolate it from the input and earth ground (assuming
T1's insulation is adequate).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is no high voltage from such a device, check the following:
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      Make sure power is actually getting to the high voltage portion of the
  unit.  Test the wall socket and/or AC adapter or other power supply for
  proper voltage with a multimeter.
      <p>
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      Excessive dirt/dust/muck/moisture or physical damage or a misplaced paper
  clip may be shorting it out or resulting in arcing or corona (a strong aroma
  of ozone would be an indication of this).  With such a small available
  current (only uA) it doesn't take much for contamination to be a problem.
  Thoroughly clean and dry the unit and check for shorts (with a multimeter
  between the HV electrodes and case) and then test it again.  Your problems
  may be gone!
      <p>
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      If this doesn't help and the unit is not fully potted (in which case,
  replacement is the only option), check for shorted or open components,
  especially the power semiconductors.

      Well, maybe :-).  This thing is about the size of a hot-dog and plugs

what else.  Whether there is any effect on air quality (beneficial or
otherwise) or any other effects is questionable but it does contain a nice

      T1 is constructed on a 1/4" diameter ferrite core.  The D (Drive) and F
(Feedback) windings are wound bifilar style (interleaved) directly on the
core.  The O (Output) winding is wound on a nylon sleeve which slips over
the core and is split into 10 sections with an equal number of turns (100
each) with insulation in between them.
      <p>
       DL1 to DL4 look like neon light bulbs with a single electrode.  They glow like
neon light bulbs when the circuit is powered and seem to capacitively couple
the HV pulses to the grounded grid in such a way to generate ozone.  I don't
know if they are filled with special gas or are just weird neon light bulbs.

      Ultrasonic cleaning is a means of removing dirt and surface contamination from
intricate and/or delicate parts using powerful high frequency sound waves in
a liquid (water/detergent/solvent) bath.
      <p>
       An ultrasonic cleaner contains a power oscillator driving a large piezoelectric

massive.

       The power transistor (Q1) and its associated components form an self excited
driver for the piezo-transducer (PT1).  I do not have specs on Q1 but based on
the circuit, it probably has a Vceo rating of at least 500 V and power rating
of at least 50 W.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two windings on the transformer (T1, which is wound on a toroidal ferrite
core) provide drive (D) and feedback (F) respectively.  L1 along with the
inherent capacitance of PT1 tunes the output circuit for maximum amplitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       The output of this (and similar units) are bursts of high frequency (10s to
100s of kHz) acoustic waves at a 60 Hz repetition rate.  The characteristic
sound these ultrasonic cleaners make during operation is due to the effects
of the bursts occuring at 60 Hz since you cannot actually hear the ultrasonic
frequencies they use.
      </p>
      <p>
       The frequency of the ultrasound is approximately 80 kHz for this unit with a
maximum amplitude of about 460 VAC RMS (1,300 V p-p) for a 115 VAC input.
      </p>
      <p>
       WARNING: Do not run the device with an empty tank since it expects to have
a proper load.  Do not touch the bottom of the tank and avoid putting your
paws into the cleaning solution while the power is on.  I don't know what,
if any, long term effects there may be but it isn't worth taking chances.
The effects definitely feel strange.  At high enough power levels, it could
indeed pulverize bones as described below.  Whether that could happen with
the typical small ultrasonic cleaner, I don't know and am not about to find
out!

        "While stationed on board the now-decommissioned submarine USS
 Hawkbill (SSN-666), I pondered this as well.  One of my senior shipmates
 related a story of a sailor who had done that very act on his previous
 submarine.  The guy put his feet it the cleaner while it was powered on.
 He remarked that it felt very good and relaxing.  After a few minutes, he
 pulled his feet out, and as soon as he stood up and applied his full bodily
 weight on his feet, all the bones in his feet had shattered.  He got
 permanent disability from it.  Apparently, it had rattled his bones apart.
 Wow!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where the device doesn't oscillate (it appears as dead as a door-nail), first
check for obvious failures such as bad connections and cracked, scorched, or
obliterated parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get inside probably requires removing the bottom cover (after pulling the
plug and disposing of the cleaning solution!).
      </p>
      <p>
       CAUTION: Confirm that all large capacitors are discharged before touching
anything inside!
      </p>
      <p>
       The semiconductors (Q1, D1, D2, D3) can be tested for shorts with a multimeter
(see the document:
       <a href="semitest.htm">
        Basic Testing of
Semiconductor Devices
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The transformer (T1) or inductor (L1) could have internal short circuits
preventing proper operation and/or blowing other parts due to excessive load
but this isn't kind of failure likely as you might think.  However, where all
the other parts test good but the cleaning action appears weak without any
overheating, a L1 could be defective (open or other bad connections) detuning
the output circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the transistor and/or fuse has blown, look for a visible burn mark on
the transducer and/or test it (after disconnecting) with a multimeter.  If
there is a mark or your test shows anything less than infinite resistance,
there may have been punch-through of the dielectric between the two plates.
I don't know whether this could be caused by running the unit with nothing in
the tank but it might be possible.  If the damage is localized, you may be able
to isolate the area of the hole by removing the metal electrode layer
surrounding it to provide an insulating region 1/4 inch in diameter.  This
will change the resonant frequency of the output circuit a small amount but
hopefully not enough to matter.  You have nothing to lose since replacing the
transducer is likely not worth it (and perhaps not even possible since it is
probably solidly bonded to the bottom of the tank).
      </p>
      <p>
       When testing, use a series light bulb to prevent the power transistor from
blowing should there be a short circuit somewhere (see the document:
       <a href="tshoot.htm">
        Troubleshooting and
Repair of Consumer Electronic Equipment

empty tank.

       Plasma Mug HV Generator
      </h3>
      This circuit was found in a cheap "plasma mug" - a double wall partially
evacuated and gas-filled clear glass mug that glows in strange patterns when
sitting on the energizer base, depending on how it is touched or held.  The
circuit is the typical one transistor oscillator driving a small potted
transformer.  Q1 was on a heatsink.  The hard potted HV transformer occupied a
volume of less than 1 inch cubed.  Only the resistances of its windings have
been measured so far.  Someday I may get around to determining more about it.
The listed power requirements for this unit were 12 V at 250 mA.  It would run
on either 8 AA cells or a wall adapter.  There was also a power switch as well
as the usual third contact on the power jack to disconnect the battery
when using the adapter (not shown).

      <h3>
       Converting an AC Output Wall Adapter to DC
      </h3>
      Where a modest source of DC is required for an appliance or other device,
it may be possible to add a rectifier and filter capacitor (and possibly
a regulator as well) to a wall adapter with an AC output.  While many wall
adapter output DC, some - modems and some phone answering machines, for
example - are just transformers and output low voltage AC.
      <p>
       This is also the simplest and safest way to construct a small DC power supply
as you do not need to deal with the 110 VAC at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       To convert such an adapter to DC requires the use of:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Bridge rectifier - turns AC into pulsating DC.
       </li>
       <li>
        Filter capacitor - smooths the output reducing its ripple.
       </li>
       <li>
        Regulator - produces a nearly constant output voltage.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Depending on your needs, you may find a suitable wall adapter in your junk
box (maybe from that 2400 baud modem that was all the rage a couple of years
ago!).
      <p>
       The basic circuit is shown below:
      </p>
      <pre>
       Bridge Rectifier   Filter Capacitor

    AC o-----+----|&gt;|-------+---------+-----o DC (+)
            ~|              |+        |
   In from   +----|&lt;|----+  |       +_|_   Out to powered device
   AC wall               |  |      C ___   or voltage regulator

             |           |            |
    AC o-----+----|&lt;|----+------------+-----o DC (-)
            ~                -
      </pre>
      Considerations:
      <ul>
       <li>
        An AC input of Vin VRMS will result in a peak output of approximately
  1.4 Vin - 1.4 V.  The first factor of 1.4 results from the fact that the
  peak value of a sinusoid (the power line waveform) is 1.414 (sqrt(2))
  times the RMS value.  The second factor of 1.4 is due to the two diodes
  that are in series as part of the bridge rectifier.  The fact that they
  are both about 1.4 is a total coincidence.
        <p>
         Therefore, you will need to find an AC wall adapter that produces an output
  voltage which will result in something close to what you need.  However,
  this may be a bit more difficult than it sounds since the nameplate rating
  of many wall adapters is not an accurate indication of what they actually
  produce especially when lightly loaded.  Measuring the output is best.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Select the filter capacitor to be at least 10,000 uF per 1000 mA of output
  current with a voltage rating of at least 2 x Vin.  This rule of thumb will
  result in a ripple of less than 1 V p-p which will be acceptable for many
  devices or where a voltage regulator is used (but may be inadequate for
  some audio devices resulting in some 120 Hz hum.  Use a larger or additional
  capacitor or a regulator in such a case.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Suitable components can be purchased at any electronics distributor as well
  as Radio Shack.  The bridge rectifier comes as a single unit or you can put
  one together from 1N400x diodes (the x can be anything from 1 to 7 for these
  low voltage applications).  Observe the polarity for the filter capacitor!
       </li>
      </ul>
      The following examples illustrate some of the possibilities.
      <ul>
       <li>
        Example 1: A typical modem power pack is rated at 12 VAC but actually
  produces around 14 VAC at modest load (say half the nameplate current
  rating).  This will result in about 17 to 18 VDC at the output of the
  rectifier and filter capacitor.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Example 2: A cordless VAC battery charger adapter might produce 6 VAC.
  This would result in 6 to 7 VDC at the output of the rectifier and filter
  capacitor.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Adding an IC regulator to either of these would permit an output of up to
a fraction to 2.5 V (depending on type) less than the filtered DC voltage.

      <h3>
       Adding an IC Regulator to a Wall Adapter or Battery
      </h3>
      For many applications, it is desirable to have a well regulated source of
DC power.  This may be the case when running equipment from batteries as
well as from a wall adapter that outputs a DC voltage or the enhanced adapter
described in the section:
      <a href="#schslp0">
       Converting an AC output wall
adapter to DC
      </a>
      .
      <p>
       The following is a very basic introduction to the construction of a circuit
with appropriate modifications will work for outputs in the range of about
1.25 to 35 V and currents up 1 A.  This can also be used as the basis for a
small general purpose power supply for use with electronics experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you want is an IC called an 'adjustable voltage regulator'.  The LM317 is
one example - Radio Shack should have it along with a schematic.  The LM317
looks like a power transistor but is a complete regulator on a chip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a sample circuit:
      </p>
      <pre>
       I +-------+ O                       
    Vin (+) o-----+---| LM317 |---+--------------+-----o Vout (+)
                  |   +-------+   |              |
                  |       | A     /              |
                  |       |       \ R1 = 240     |
                  |       |       /              |           ___
                 _|_ C1   |       |            +_|_ C2      |_0_|  LM317
                 --- .01  +-------+             --- 1 uF    |   |  1 - Adjust
                  |  uF   |                    - |          |___|  2 - Output
                  |       \                      |           |||   3 - Input
                  |       / R2                   |           123
                  |       \                      |
                  |       |                      |
    Vin(-) o------+-------+----------------------+-----o Vout (-)
      </pre>
      Note: Not all voltage regulator ICs use this pinout.  If you are not using an
LM317, double check its pinout - as well as all the other specifications.
For a single output not referenced to a common, it doesn't matter
whether a positive voltage regulator (as shown) or negative voltage regulator
is used.  However, were multiple power supplies like this are needed WITH a
common point, negative voltage regulator ICs must be used for the negative
ones.
      <p>
       Here are pinouts for the most common types:
      </p>
      <pre>
       78xx (Fixed Pos)    79xx (Fixed Neg)    LM317 (Adj Pos)     LM337 (Adj Neg)
   ___                 ___                 ___                 ___
  |_O_|               |_O_|               |_O_|               |_O_|
  |   | 1 = Input     |   | 1 = Common    |   | 1 = Adjust    |   | 1 = Adjust 
  |___| 2 = Common    |___| 2 = Input     |___| 2 = Output    |___| 2 = Input
   |||  3 = Output     |||  3 = Output     |||  3 = Input      |||  3 = Output
   123                 123                 123                 123
      </pre>
      <p>
       Note: Various manufacturers may label the pins differently than shown just to
be confusing.  For example, 1,3,2 instead of 1,2,3.  However, the location of
each pin will be the same so double check with the diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the LM317:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        R2 = (192 x Vout) - 240, where R2 in ohms, Vout is in volts and must be at
   between 1.2 V and 35 V.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Vin should be at least 2.5V greater than Vout.  Select a wall adapter with
   a voltage at least 2.5 V greater than your regulated output at full load.
        <p>
         However, note that a typical adapter's voltage may vary quite a bit
   depending on manufacturer and load.  You will have to select one that
   isn't too much greater than what you really want since this will add
   unnecessary wasted power in the device and additional heat dissipation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Maximum output current is 1 A.  Your adapter must be capable of supplying
   the maximum current safely and without its voltage drooping below the
   requirement in (2) above.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Additional filter capacitance (across C1) on the adapter's output may help
   (or be required) to reduce its ripple and thus the swing of its input.
   This may allow you to use an adapter with a lower output voltage and reduce
   the power dissipation in the regulator as well.
        <p>
         Using 10,000 uF per *amp* of output current will result in less than 1 V
   p-p ripple on the input to the regulator.  As long as the input is always
   greater than your desired output voltage plus 2.5 V, the regulator will
   totally remove this ripple resulting in a constant DC output independent
   of line voltage and load current fluctuations.  (For you purists, the
   regulator isn't quite perfect but is good enough for most applications.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Make sure you select a capacitor with a voltage rating at least 25% greater
   than the adapter's *unloaded* peak output voltage and observe the polarity!
        </p>
        <p>
         Note: wall adapters designed as battery chargers may not have any filter
   capacitors so this will definitely be needed with this type.  Quick check:
   If the voltage on the adapter's output drops to zero as soon as it is pulled
   from the wall - even with no load - it does not have a filter capacitor.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        The tab of the LM317 is connected to the center pin - keep this in mind
   because the chip will have to be on a heat sink if it will be dissipating
   more than a watt or so.  P = (Vout - Vin) * Iout.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        There are other considerations - check the datasheet for the LM317
   particularly if you are running near the limits of 35 V and/or 1 A.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        For a negative output power supply, use the corresponding negative voltage
   regulator and note that their pinout is NOT the same as for the positive
   variety.  See above!

       Dual Output Power Supply Using Non-Centertapped Transformer
      </h3>
      Without a centertap, it is still possible to provide both polarities of output
voltage but a half wave configuration must be used.  This is similar to the
wiring of a voltage doubler but we are using the common point as ground:
      <p>
       Here is a circuit for a +/- 12 VDC supply:

      <p>
       Since only half-wave rectification is used, the main filter caps, C1 and C2,
should be at least twice the uF value compared to full wave or bridge circuits
to obtain the same ripple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another disadvantage of this configuration is that if the currents drawn from
the outputs aren't equal, net DC flows through the transformer secondary
(with a voltage doubler having no output connection to the common point,
this isn't possible).  Core saturation may result if operating near the
transformer's maximum current ratings.

       Higher Current Operation
      </h3>
      By adding a PNP power transistor like a 2N2955 to either a fixed or adjustable
regulator, maximum current can be easily increased.  The circuit below will
permit a very simple 3 to 5 A, 5 V power supply to be constructed assuming the
power transformer/rectifier can supply this current.  Q1 MUST be mounted
on a large heat sink since it is dissipating power equal almost the entire
output current times the difference between input and output voltage!  Also,
keep in mind that the filter capacitor(s) on the supply providing Vin must also
be sized accordingly to keep ripple to a manageable level.

      The way this works is that once the current exceeds about Vbe(Q1)/5 A, Q1
turns on and bypasses current around the 7805.
      <p>
       For a negative supply based on a 79xx regulator, use an NPN transistor like
a 2N3055 and reverse the capacitor polarities.  Don't forget that the pinout
for the 79xx and other negative voltage regulators is NOT the same as for
the positive variety.  See the section:

      and is shown using
an adjustable regulator though a fixed regulator could also be used.  This
is similar to the circuit in the Texas Instruments LM317 datasheet.  Although
not specified, I expect this is good for up to 5 A or more depending on the
actual voltage difference between input and output and the size of the heat
sink used for the power transistor, Q2.  Using this configuration rather
than something like an emitter follower provides much better regulation
since the point of regulation for the LM317 is still the actual output of
the circuit.

       * For proper regulation, RL must be low enough in value to guarantee at least a
30 mA current at the selected output voltage.  It can be a separate resistor
or part of the actual load.
      </p>
      <p>
       For even higher current operation, multiple power transistors (Q2) can be
wired in parallel as a pass-bank with small (e.g., 0.1 ohm) emitter resistors
to balance the load.  In this case, Q1 may need to be a slightly bigger
transistor and R4 reduced in value to provide adequate base drive.  Details
will depend on your particular needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with the other circuits, a negative power supply can be constructed by
using the appropriate regulator IC, swapping NPN or PNP transistors, and
reversing all the polarities of the capacitors and diode.

       (From: David Subert (voodoo2daddy@yahoo.com).)
      </p>
      <p>
       As it turns out, the bipolar transistors can be replaced by IRF9630 MOSFETS.
The only other modification required is to change the value of the 5 ohm
resistor in order to properly bias the MOSFET. This is significant because
MOSFETs can be easily arranged in parallel without having to worry about the
inconsistent BETA of parallel BJTs.

The power transformer (T1) that I used was actually rewound from one that
was rated at 12 V, 1 A.  This was a high quality transformer, so removing
2/3rds of the secondary was quite a pain.  Actually, the purpose was an
experiment to see if it could be done non-destructively.  Conclusions: Just
barely. :-)  Obviously, a transformer actually designed to produce about
4 or 5 V at 3 A could also be used.
       <p>
        D1 to D4 can be individual diodes or a bridge rated for at least 3 A.
       </p>
       <p>
        The regulator (IC1) is an LT1084CP which is similar to an LM317 but is a low
dropout type rated at 5 A max.  I had a pile of these left over from a certain
multi-million dollar project that had been cancelled due to upper management
foot in a** disease.....  An external pass transistor may be needed to use
an LM317 because of the peak current requirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the transformer only being rated for 1 A, with IC1 on a modest
heatsink, the supply seems perfectly happy putting out 3 A at 1.5 V for an
extended period.  I don't know that I would run it all day at this high
current but for my purposes, it seems fine.
       </p>
       <p>
        It turns out that the typical electronic flash circuit from a disposable
camera like the Kodak MAX (see
        <a href="kflashm.gif">
         Schematic
        </a>
        and
        <a href="kflashmp.gif">
         Photo
        </a>
        ), actually draws more
than 3 A at the start of its recharge cycle.  So, the voltage does dip a
bit but this doesn't affect much of anything.  Recharge time with the power
supply is at least as rapid as with a fresh Alkaline cell.  The voltage from
an Alkaline cell also dips a bit under these conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously, the circuit could be easily modified to put out 2.4 VDC (for a pair
of NiCd cells), 3 VDC (for two Alkalines), or whatever else you might need.

       Full Wave Voltage Doubler

      A problem with most voltage doubler circuits is that the positive and negative
outputs operate on alternate half-cycles so ripple is at the power line
frequency rather than at twice the power line frequency.  The transformer is
also not utilized efficiently since only half of the secondary winding is
passing current at any given time.

      <a href="b12vc.gif">
       Boost Supply to Produce Clean Regulated +12 VDC
      </a>
      shows
an approach for getting a higher voltage than +12 VDC from an unmodified PC
power supply.  In this specific case, a source of +12 VDC for an audio or
instrumentation PCI card was needed to be derived from the normally noisy
+12 VDC output of a standard PC power supply.  Any filtering would reduce
the voltage below an acceptable level.  The 555 implements an oscillator
that runs at somewhere around 50 kHz which drives the MOSFET chopper
and stepdown transformer to generate a few VDC which is added to the original
12 VDC from the PC.  This is then regulated down using the 7812.  By only
generating a few V boost (just enough for the dropout requirements of the
linear regulator) rather than the full output voltage, the components can be
smaller since less power is involved.
      <p>
       Obviously, other voltages than +12 VDC can be produced in this manner - the
example was a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could also be done with fewer components using modern SMPS ICs designed
DC-DC converter applications but I don't have any suggestions off-hand.

       Power Supply for Small SVGA Color Monitor
      </h3>
      This is the complete schematic for the switchmode power supply (SMPS)
from a small (probably 14 or 15 inch) "I guarantee you never heard of the
brand name" SVGA color monitor.
      <p>
       The AC line input and degauss components are at the upper left, the SMPS
chopper, its controller, and feedback opto-isolator are in the lower
left/middle, and the secondaries - some with additional regulation components -
occupy the entire right side of this diagram.  Even for relatively basic
application such as this, the circuitry is quite complex.  There are more than
a half dozen separate outputs regulated in at least 3 different ways!
      </p>
      <p>
       The variable voltage B+ regulator is in the upper right corner.  This provides
an voltage to power the horizontal deflection which is determined by the
video input.  To maintain the same picture width, the required voltage to the
horizontal output transistor/flyback needs to be roughly proportional to
horizontal scan rate.

      Most of these circuits were reversed engineered from commercial products.  The
good news is that this means they probably all work somewhat reliably.  The
bad news is that a custom wound transformer (you can build in most cases) will
be needed and there may be errors in the number of turns and wire sizes listed
since these were all determined without totally dismembering the unit in
question.
      <p>
       However, the circuit described in the section:
       <a href="#schssi">

       </a>
       only requires off-the-shelf components but has a pitiful
efficiency. But construction is, well, super simple :-).
      </p>

       And, it should be easy to make modifications to the flash units from pocket

      <h3>
       Super Simple Inverter
      </h3>
      This circuit can be used to power a small strobe or fluorescent lamp.  It will
generate over 400 VDC from a 12 VDC, 2.5 A power supply or an auto or marine
battery.  While size, weight, and efficiency are nothing to write home about -
in fact, they are quite pitiful - all components are readily available (even
from Radio Shack) and construction is very straightforward.  No custom coils
or transformers are required.  If wired correctly, it will work.
      <p>
       Output depends on input voltage.  Adjust for your application.  With the
component values given, it will generate over 400 V from a 12 V supply and
charge a 200 uF capacitor to 300 V in under 5 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your less intense applications, a fluorescent lamp can be powered directly
from the secondary (without any other components).  This works reasonably well
with a F13-T5 or F15-T12 bulb (but don't expect super brightness).  Q1 does
get quite hot so use a good heat sink.

        D1 provides a return path for the base drive and prevents significant

       <li>
        D2 should be a high speed (fast recovery) rectifier.  However, for testing,

        Mount Q1 (2N3055) on a heat sink if continuous operation is desired.  It
    will get warm.  Other NPN power transistors with Vceo &gt; 80 V, Ic &gt; 2 A,
    and Hfe &gt; 15 should work.  For a PNP type, reverse the the polarities of
    the power supply and D1, and interchange one set of leads (where a diode

        When testing, use a variable power supply so you get a feel for how much

      <p>
       The
       <a href="amtac1.gif">
        AmerTac Fluorescent Lamp Ballast
       </a>
       is from a
portable 12 V light made in China for American Tack &amp; Hardware Co sold in Home
Depot stores.  It burned out after about 30 minutes of continuous use.  (OK,
maybe you shouldn't consider duplicating this exactly! --- Sam)  So I decided
to take it apart and see what was in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it had was a very small circuit board (about 1/2" x 2").  Both the
transformer and the transistor were melted beyond recognition.  The
transformer was apparently custom made out of two 'E' cores taped together.
I have another identical unit, so I could read the transistor part number:
2SD882.  It is rated 80 V, 5 A, 40 W, typical Hfe of 30, in a TO127 package.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike many of the others, this circuit powers both both filaments in the tube
but is otherwise very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have another identical unit which hasn't been fried so I put a UV bulb in
there and fired it up.  It is clear that only one end has a glowing filament.
It is the end connected to pins 5 &amp; 6 of the transformer.  The filament
attached to pins 1 and 2 appears to only work as a resistor.  The circuit will
not operate without the bulb so I wasn't able to get reliable readings.

        T1 is an E-core ferrite transformer.  The core is 5/8" x 3/4" x 3/16"
   overall.  The outer legs of the core are 1/8" thick.  The central leg
   is 3/16" square.  The square nylon bobbin has a diameter of 5/16".  There
   is a .020" gap (spacer) in between the two halves of the E-core.
        <p>
         The 315T O (Output) is wound first followed by the 28T D (Drive) and 28T F
   (Feedback) windings.  There should be a strip of mylar insulating tape
   between each of the windings.
        </p>
        <p>
         The number of turns were estimated without disassembly as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          The wire sizes were determined by matching the diameters of the visible
     ends of the wire for each winding to magnet wire of known AWG.
          <p>
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          The number of turns in the Output winding was determined based on its
     measured resistance, core diameter, and the wire gauge tables.
          <p>
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          A 50 kHz .1 V p-p signal was then injected into the Feedback winding.
     The amplitudes of the resulting outputs from the Drive and Output
     windings were then measured.  From these, the ratios of the number of
     turns were calculated.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        The transistor was totally unmarked.  A general purpose NPN medium power
   transistor like a 2N3053 or ECG24 should work.  For PNP types, reverse the
   polarities of the power supply and C1.
        <p>
         Since it is very low power, no heat sink is used in the Archer flashlight.
   However, for other applications, one may be needed.

         T1 is an E-core ferrite transformer.  The core is 1/2" x 5/8" x 3/16"
   overall.  The outer legs of the core are 3/32" thick.  The central leg
   is 3/16" square.  The square nylon bobbin has a diameter of 5/16".  There
   is a .010" (estimate) gap (spacer) in between the two halves of the E-core.
         <p>
          The 160T O (Output) is wound first followed by the 16T H (Heater), 32T D
   (Drive), and 16 T F (Feedback) windings.  There should be a strip of mylar
   insulating tape between each of the windings.
         </p>
         <p>
          The number of turns were estimated after unsoldering the transformer from
   the circuit board as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The wire sizes were determined by matching the diameters of the visible
     ends of the wire for each winding to magnet wire of known AWG.
           <p>
           </p>
          </li>
          <li>
           The number of turns in the Output winding was determined based on its
     measured resistance, core diameter, and the wire gauge tables.
           <p>
           </p>
          </li>
          <li>
           A 100 kHz .1 V p-p signal was then injected into the Drive winding.  The
     amplitudes and phases relationship of the resulting outputs from the
     Feedback, Heater, and Output windings were then measured.  From these,
     the ratios of the number of turns and winding start/end were determined.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         The transistor was an MPX9610.  I was not able to locate specs for this
   part number but a transistor like a 2N3053 or ECG24 should work.  For PNP
   types, reverse the polarities of the power supply and C1.
         <p>
          Since it is very low power, no heat sink is used in the Energizer
   flashlight.  However, for other applications, one may be needed.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         Some experimentation with component values may improve performance for
   your application.
         <p>
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         When testing, use a variable power supply so you get a feel for how much
   output voltage is produced for each input voltage.  Component values are
   not critical but behavior under varying input/output voltage and load
   conditions will be affected by C2 and C3, the number of turns on each of
   the windings of T1, and the gain of your particular transistor.

        The original transistor is marked 8050 C0ZC.  A 2N3055 works better than
   the original, the tube starts faster and the transistor runs much cooler.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        T1 is a ferrite E-core transformer measuring 17mm x 15mm x 15mm. The core
   seems to be 5 mm thick.  The turns ratio has not been determined.  Winding
   W1 is made of ~0.2 mm wire, the resistance is below 1 ohm.  The data for
   winding W2 is the same as winding W1.  Winding W3 is made of ~0.5 mm wire
   and its resistance is 5 ohms.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        The original tube is an F4T5BLB blacklight tube, but the inverter has been
   tested with an ordinary F4T5 tube as well as a Philips 6W tube. The 6W tube
   causes the original transistor to run quite hot, so using a 2N3055 or
   similar power NPN is recommended.
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        4.5V seems to be the absolute minimal voltage required to start an F4T5
   tube. 5V will start the 6W tube when a 2N3055 transistor is used.  Voltage
   can probably be cranked up above 12V, but that was the highest I tried
   (Didn't want to test when the tube blows).
        <p>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        CAUTION: The inverter can give a nice(?) shock when run with the original
   transistor on 5V. With a 2N3055 and higher supply voltage, it can be nasty.
   Avoid touching the tube terminals. The bottom of the PCB can also give
   quite suprise, as I discovered :-(.

     The transformer was an E-core ferrite, most likely E20. The primary and
 feedback windings were wound side-by-side first, followed by a strip of
 insulating tape, then the secondary. I'm absolutely positive that it was
 #38, however the primaries may also have been #26. There were tiny spacers
 on both outer legs, consisting of two layers of the same yellow insulating
 tape that was used to hold both halves of the core together. Total not
 thicker than .004". I could not remove the core without destroying it, so I
 don't know if there was a gap or spacer on the central leg. Stupid as I am,
 I forgot to measure the inductance of the secondary before disassembling, so
 no calculations about the AL value of the core can be made. :(
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Q1 was in a TO-220 case (not heatsinked) and marked "D313 F5H4", so I
 suppose it was a 2SD313. If so, from what I know it would have an Ic of 2 A,
 a Vceo of 50 V and an hFE of 40..320. It ran very cool in the circuit. Power
 consumption from 12 V was about 250 mA - the tube was lit fairly bright, but
 of course not at full power. On the label it states "Power: 12 Volt DC at 5
 Amps", but I don't think the latter is correct. ;)
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     It has got a long cable with a nice set of plugs - a pair of alligator
 clips as well as a cigarette lighter plug. It's made in China, cost the
 equivalent of $8 and could not be disassembled without cutting thick black
 rubber apart.

   I just experimented with rebuilding it a bit. It works fine with a home-made
transformer using an E 25 core (25 mm core width, or 0.79"). I tried both an
un-gapped (AL = 1750 nH) and a 0.4" gapped (on central leg; AL = 151 nH)
version. Concerning efficiency, the result was more or less the same, but
due to the higher switching frequency with the gap, there was no buzzing
sound from the transformer. It worked even with 32 primary and 350 secondary
turns, secondary wound first with the output and feedback winding not
side-by-side but one over another. It's also great as an inverter for use
with a G4 to T5 to erase EPROMs, as I discovered.
   <p>
    Transistors with low gain don't seem to work well - BD237 and 2N5191 were
reasonably good. It's easy to have it operate at more power - just
decreasing the 5.1K resistor and adding a small heatsink works great.
   </p>
   <p>
    The filter capacitor gets pretty warm; needs to be low ESR or it will
probably overheat, especially at higher power levels.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the original inverter, there was a connection between the secondary and
ground. Strange - it doesn't seem to make any sense because nothing changes
if you remove it. But they have got their reasons, I suppose.

     T1 is an E-core ferrite transformer.  The core is 5/8" x 3/4" x 3/16"
   overall.  The outer legs of the core are 3/32" thick.  The central leg is
   3/16" square.  The square nylon bobbin has a diameter of 5/16".  There is
   no visible spacer between the cores but I did not disassemble to confirm.
     <p>
      The 350T O (Output) is wound first followed by the 25T D (Drive) and 18T F
   (Feedback) windings.  There should be a strip of mylar insulating tape
   between each of the windings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of turns were estimated without disassembly as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       The resistances of each of the windings was measured to determine the
     arrangement of the transformer.
       <p>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       The inverter was run at just enough input voltage for it to oscillate
     (so the load of the fluorescent tube would not affect the readings) and
     the voltages on all 3 windings were measured on an oscilloscope.
     From this, the ratios for the windings were determined.
       <p>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       An estimate was made of the number of turns likely to be on the Drive
     winding based on other similar designs.  The number of turns on the
     other windings were calculated based on the turns ratios.  Wire size
     is probably #36 AWG.

   would guess that a general purpose medium NPN power transistor like a 2N3053
   or ECG24 should work.  For a PNP type, reverse the polarities of the
   power supply and C1.
     <p>
      Since it is very low power, no heat sink is used in this lamp.  However,
   for other applications, one may be needed.

     When testing, use a variable power supply so you get a feel for how much
   output voltage is produced for each input voltage.  Component values are
   not critical but behavior under varying input/output voltage and load
   conditions will be affected by C2, C3, R1, R2, the number of turns on each
   of the windings of T1, and the gain of your particular transistor.

     Gary's EPROM Eraser

   </h4>
   (From: Gary Perry (perry_gary@ascom.co.uk).)

I used this circuit based on this design to build an EPROM eraser, using the
4 watt G4T5 germicidal tube.
   <p>
    The tube seems to like 75 VAC in order to 'fire it up'.
   </p>
   <p>
    I used a 2N3053 transistor and a commonly available
commercial 6 - 0 - 6 primary 240VAC 100mA secondary transformer.
After 25 minutes constant usage, both transistor and transformer
remained cool.
   </p>
   <p>
    A variable PSU was connected, and the circuit worked first time. The required
75 VAC output was achieved with only 5 VDC input.

     Low Power Fluorescent Lamp Inverter 2

   The circuit below is the type used in inexpensive fluorescent camping lanterns.
In this particular model, an F6-T5 lamp was used.  It will drive F4-T5 to
F13-T5 tubes depending on input voltage.  The power source can be a 4 to 9 V,
2 A power supply (depending on the size of your lamp) or a suitable battery
pack.  This design was reverse engineered from a random commercial unit of
unknown manufacture using a lead-acid battery battery that expired long ago.

     Construction can take any convenient form - perf board, minibox, etc.
   Make sure the output connections are well insulated.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     T1 is assembled on a square nylon bobbin, 3/8" cubed.  Wind the 250T O
   (Output) first, insulate with mylar tape, 20T D (Drive) next, and 7T F/S
   (Feedback/Starting) last.  Observe directions of windings as indicated by
   the dots (o).  The number of turns for the O winding was estimated based
   on measured winding resistance, wire size, and the dimensions of the bobbin.
     <p>
      The core is just a straight piece of ferrite 1/4" x 1/4" x 1-3/8"  It is
   fully open - there is no gap.

     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Any general purpose NPN power transistor with Vceo &gt; 80 V, Ic &gt; 2 A, and
   Hfe &gt; 15 should work.  For a PNP type, reverse the polarities of the power
   supply, C1, D1, and D2.
     <p>
      Use a good heat sink for continuous operation at higher power levels (6 V
   input or above).  The type used (2SC1826) was a replacement after I fried
   the unidentified transistor originally installed (103-SV2P001).
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Pushbutton switches are used to control operation.  S1 (Start) provides
   initial base drive to the transistor via the Feedback/Starting winding of
   T1 until the tube arc is established.  At that point, feedback is sustained
   via current flowing through the tube.  S2 (Off) shorts the base of the
   transistor to ground to stop the oscillator.
     <p>
      Like a regular manual start preheat fluorescent fixture, the start switch,
   must be depressed until the lamp comes on at full brightness indicating that
   the filaments are adequately heated.

    Low Power Fluorescent Lamp Inverter 3
   </h3>
   (From: Isaac D. Koch.)
   <p>
    I picked this up at an estate auction.  C1 was unmarked but should have a
voltage rating of at least 16 volts.  I replaced mine with a
higher value trying to make it work better, and I don't know what the original
voltage rating was, but I think it was 16 V.
The transformer turns are unknown.
I'm sure the capacitor tolerances are not very important, but I included them
anyway.

    I added a power jack on the case and I think I used the wrong polarity when I
plugged it in again, but either way, it didn't work.  I had to replace the
transistor.  I ended up changing the polarity of the circuit (by changing
the power polarity and the polarization of C1), and using a PNP transistor,
H945, salvaged from a computer power supply.

     Medium Power Fluorescent Lamp Inverter

   </h3>
   This circuit is capable of driving a variety of fluorescent lamps from a 4 to
12 V, 2 to 2.5 A DC power supply, rechargeable battery pack, or auto or marine
battery.  With appropriate modifications (if needed) it may be used for other
applications like powering an electronic flash or HeNe laser tube.  The
transformer will need to be custom wound (by you) but this is not really
difficult - just slightly time consuming for the 600 turn O (Output) winding
if you don't have a coil winding machine.
   <p>
    I have used it with fluorescent tubes of many sizes: F6-T5, F13-T5, F15-T12,
and F20-T12.  The arc will be sustained with the filaments hot on an input
as low as about 3.5 to 4 V (with a new tube) but during starting, an input
voltage of about 5 or 6 V may be needed until the filaments are hot enough
to sustain the arc at the lower voltage.

    Two nearly identical circuits are shown.
   </p>

     This design saves a couple of diodes but requires a centertapped feedback

   The switching frequency is about 21 kHz and varies less than 5 percent over
the range of input voltage for which the bulb remains lit (it is significantly
higher with no load - about 140 kHz).  An input voltage of about 4 V is needed
to start oscillation (reducing R1 or increasing R2 would lower this at the
expense of efficiency at higher voltages) but it will continue well below 3 V.
   <p>
    The measured input current at various input voltages for two lamp types are
shown in the chart below.  SV (Starting Voltage) is the minimum input voltage
required to preheat the filaments before the lamp will turn on (current is
lower until filaments are hot).  FB (Full Brightness) is the point at which
the lamp appears to be operating at the same intensity as if it were installed
in a normal 115 VAC fixture.

     T1 is an E-core ferrite transformer.  Once complete, the cores are installed
   on the bobbin with a 2 mm gap.  Some experimentation with the core gap may
   be needed to optimize performance for a given lamp type and input voltage.
     <p>
      Each E core is 1" x 1/2" x 1/4"  overall.  The outer legs of the core are
   1/8" thick.  The central leg is 1/4" square.  The square nylon bobbin has
   a diameter of 5/16" and length of 3/8".
     </p>
     <p>
      The 600T O (Output) is wound first followed by the 15T D (Drive) and 10T F
   (Feedback) windings.  For convenience, wind the D and F windings bifiler
   style (the two wires together).  Determine the appropriate connections
   with an ohmmeter (or label the ends).  The centertaps are brought out to
   terminals.  Try to distribute the O winding uniformly across the entire
   bobbin area by winding it in multiple layers.  This will assure that no
   wires with a significant voltage difference are adjacent.  There should be
   a strip of insulating tape between the O and the other windings.

     L1 isolates the power supply.  It is 24 turns of #22 wire wound on a 1/4"

   more strength at low voltage with it.

     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     The transistors are MJE3055T (2N3055 in a TO220 package) types but are not
   critical.  However, I expect that some faster switching transistors would
   run cooler.  Any fast switching NPN power transistor with Vceo &gt; 80 V,
   Ic &gt; 3 A, and Hfe &gt; 15 should work.  For PNP types, reverse the polarity
   of the power supply.
     <p>
      For operation above about 6 V, a pair of good heat sinks will be required.
   However, power dissipation in the transistors does not seem to increase
   as much as expected - the base drive is probably more optimal at higher
   input voltage.

     When testing, use a variable power supply so you get a feel for how much

     Lazar's Comments on F-Lamp Inverter Design
    </a>
   </h3>
   (From: Lazar Pancic (dextter@eunet.yu).)
   <p>
    I planned one week of camping with my friends this summer, so I wanted
to make one fluorescent tube run on 12V and studied a lot of Internet
places for the ideas.  I made some of the circuits (some of them I found
on your site) but the performance was not as I expected.  Yes, they do
run a 8W tube but the brightness is quite obviously lower than when the
tube is run on mains supply.  Then I started to study app-notes of many
different electronic ballasts for fluoro-tubes and got the idea what was
wrong.  I send my conclusions to you with the hope that it could help
others in selecting the good circuit with less trouble than I got :))
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     For the good performance it is important to drive fluorescent tube by
 pure AC voltage.  It may look strange, but simple flyback transformer
 drives the tube on DC, not AC! Look at one of the flyback circuits:
 when the transistor is conducting the primary windings get more and
 more current which produces storage of magnetic energy in the core of
 the transformer.  At the point when the core saturates the base drive
 for the transistor is being suddenly cut off (this "suddenly" depends
 on the core material properties), and the stored energy is being
 transferred by the secondary winding to the tube as a high voltage
 pulse.  Since the orientation of primary and secondary windings and
 the battery (e.g.  accumulator) is always the same this pulse also has
 the same polarity every time.  That's why only one side of the tube gets
 darker after it is being run on such inverter for some period of time,
 and that is why the tube can't perform well for some reasonable
 period of time with the flyback topology of the driver.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Because there is one period within the flyback cycle when the transistor
 is only supplying the transformer with the magnetic energy and the tube
 doesn't get any portion of the energy during this period, the tube
 would probably turn off during this.  That is not good at all.  One of
 the biggest advantages of the electronic ballasts over older ballasts
 with the inductors (or transformers) is that the tube is run on high
 frequency so that it doesn't turn off at any time.  There is no flicker
 but one more important consequence is that the tube need not be
 started at the beginning of every single cycle!  That's why the tube
 has 10% more light power when being run on electronic ballasts.
 Naturally, the good ballasts have no "dead-time" in their operation cycles.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     For the long lifetime of the tube, many app-notes suggest sinusoidal
 form of the tube driving voltage, which is not the case with the
 flyback inverters.  The tube voltage would be probably the very high
 voltage pulse at the very beginning of the tube supply period of the
 inverter cycle, and approx.  100V of continuous voltage at the rest of
 the cycle (all of these is during the period while the transistor is not
 conducting; while it does, the output voltage is 0 V).
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Since only one transistor is performing the switching job, it's
 current is at least two times bigger than if there were two of them,
 for the same output power of the inverter.  For example, if the inverter
 gets constant current of 1 Amp from the power supply, the
 transistor's peak current would probably be greater then 2 Amps!
     <p>
      So, it seams that far better topology for fluorescent tube inverters is
 symmetrical push-pull inverter, such the one described in "Medium Power
 Fluorescent Lamp Inverter". There is only slightly higher cost for this
 (one power transistor more), but also fewer resistors and capacitors!
     </p>
     <p>
      The output voltage of this circuit is alternating (+/-) square wave.  The
 tube gets constant power supply (it lights during positive as well as
 during negative half-cycle, which means AC), and it doesn't turn off at all.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     It is good to preheat the electrodes of the tube before it is being
 started.  There are some of the flybacks that does so, but during this
 period of operation the peaks of output voltage are even higher.
 Unfortunately, Medium Power... doesn't preheat the tube.  This could
 be done by adding one high voltage capacitor in parallel with the
 tube.  It's capacitance should be few times lower than the one in
 series with the tube... (read on :) Notice that the oscillating
 frequency of the inverter is around 7 times higher with no load
 (e.g., when the tube is not started yet). At this very high frequency
 this small capacitor's impedance is low enough so that considerable
 preheating current could flow through the filaments.  Every simple
 compact fluorescent tube electronic ballast has one of these, the
 value of which is 2n2/1000V. I suggest using one of them or any with
 the similar properties.
     <p>
      One additional good feature of this capacitor is that it heats the
 filaments of the electrodes even during normal operation of the tube
 but in much lower rate (about  5% of the preheating current). It may
 look as a fault but it doesn't.  The lamp life would be longer if the
 filaments are hotter.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     High speed switching transistors could be the good choice but only if
 special "hard" ferrite core materials are used.  These materials have very
 sharp hysteresis curve which means that they saturate fast and provide
 fast and clean switching pulse for the transistors.  If normal core is
 used, fast switching transistors may not be of any benefit.  Nevertheless,
 standard cores for ferrite transformers tend to be made of the "hard"
 materials (and these materials get better and cheaper) so it could be
 interesting for enthusiasts to experiment.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     If you use emitter resistor as I do, it is quite likely that no cooler
 would be needed for the transistors!  It's resistance depends on the
 power of the tube that is being run and could be calculated with this
 rule-of-thumb:
     <p>
     </p>
     <pre>
      Re = 1.2V/I(Amps)
     </pre>
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Small capacitors in parallel with the base resistors help in starting the
 oscillations.  Their value is not critical (0.33 to 2.2 nF).
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Finally, there is another way of providing the base drive pulses to the
 transistors without separate "base-drive" windings.  I experimented for
 some time with this topology and find it satisfactory.  Any transistor
 type would probably need different values for resistors, bud not much
 different than one I suggested.  However - is obviously much easier to
 experiment with resistors than with number of base-drive turns :)
     <p>
      With a 12 VDC power supply, this resistor produces around 10% of power loss
 but if the compactness of the device is important, it is acceptable.
 Without it the transistors would dissipate almost the same amount of heat
 as resistor dissipates when is present, so I suggest using it anyway.  The
 inverter runs much more stablely with it and the transistors are much less
 stressed, which ensures long and reliable operation of the inverter.

     Compact Fluorescent Lamp Electronic Ballast 1
    </a>
   </h3>
   This unit is from a Techna-Bright EDXR-38-16 compact fluorescent lamp
used as a (mediocre) replacement for the ubiquitous 150 W outdoor floodlight.
It's a 3 U-section tube inside a light weight glass floodlight reflector.  With
a rated electrical input of only 16 W, I doubt it's even as bright as a 60 W
incandescent lamp.  The inverter is remarkably simple and must be dirt cheap
to manufacture.  It uses a pair of 400 V, 4 A bipolar transistors in a
self-oscillating configuration which appears to have its output in resonance
with a LC network in series with the lamp.  The only magnetic components are
an inductor for RFI suppression, an inductor in series with the lamp, and a
driver transformer for the transistor bases (3 sets of 2 or 3 turns on a
ferrite core).  An RC and diac circuit provides a kick start to get it going.
Protection of sorts (one time) consists of a fusable 0.47 ohm resistor
in the AC line input.

    The same basic circuit could be used on 220 to 240 VAC, 50 Hz but the voltage
ratings of the filter capacitor and possibly the transistors would need to
increase, and probably some other changes would be needed.  This in fact is
what 230 VAC CFL ballasts do.

model CFLs!
   </p>
   <p>
    However, note that these ballasts do not seem to be very tolerant of
any sort of fault in the lamp circuit itself and may fail instantly if
there is a short, open, intermittent connection, or wrong type or size lamp.
Thus care should be taken if attempting to use the ballast to power anything
other than the original lamp.  Double check that all wiring is correct
and secure before applying power.

schematic) boosting the half-bridge output voltage.  (L3 may actually have
at least one of its windings wired with Litz multistrand insulated wire
based on the appearance of the wire ends at its terminals.)  Gate drive
feedback is via a series L-C circuit.  A Positive Temperature Coefficient
thermistor provides current to power the tube filaments and then increases
to a high resistance while the lamp is running.  This is easier on the
filaments during starting but uses a bit extra power than might be possible
with some sort of active switching circuit to disable them. Protection is
provided by a real 1.5 A mini glass fuse wired directly to the center of
the CFL screw base.

    The same basic circuit could be used on 220 to 240 VAC, 50 Hz but the voltage
ratings of the filter capacitor and MOSFETs would need to increase, the L3
turns-ratio would decrease, and probably some other changes would be needed.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, note that these ballasts do not seem to be very tolerant of
any sort of fault in the lamp circuit itself and may fail instantly if
there is a short, open, intermittent connection, or wrong type or size lamp.
Thus care should be taken if attempting to use the ballast to power anything
other than the original lamp.  Double check that all wiring is correct
and secure before applying power.

    <a name="schbp10">
     Basic 200 W Power Inverter
    </a>
   </h3>
   This circuit was reverse engineered from a Tripp-Lite "Power-Verter" Model
PV200 DC to AC Inverter - typical of those used for camping or boating
applications where the only source of power is an auto or marine battery.
This particular model is rated 200 W continuous.  The output is a 60 Hz
squarewave and there is no regulation or precise frequency control.  (Unlike
the other circuits in this collection, it is NOT a high frequency inverter.)
   <p>
    Modifications for higher or lower output voltage are easily achieved.  For
example, a fast cycle strobe requiring 330 VDC, would only require using three
times the number of turns on the Output winding and the addition of a bridge
rectifier to charge the energy storage capacitor(s).  Alternatively, the
inverter could be used as-is with the addition of a voltage tripler.  A tripler
rather than doubler is needed because of the squarewave output.  (The RMS and
peak voltages are the same so you don't get the boost of 1.414 as you do with
the sinusoidal waveform from the power company.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Circuits similar to this will also be found inside UPSs (Uninterruptible Power
Sources) so if all you want is a cheap low voltage DC to line voltage inverter,
find a dead UPS - there's a good chance the battery is bad, not the electronics!
(However, it may not be designed for 12 VDC input.)

     Notes on Basic 200 W Power Inverter
    </a>
   </h4>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Construction was all done point-to-point - there is no circuit board.
   Layout appears not to be critical.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     T1 is a relatively large heavy laminated E-I core transformer.  The E and I
   sheets alternate direction to assure a low reluctance magnetic circuit.
     <p>
      The core dimensions are 3-3/4" x 3-1/8" x 1-1/8" overall.  The outer legs
   of the core are 5/8" thick.  The central leg is 1" wide.  The square bobbin
   has a diameter of 1-3/8".
     </p>
     <p>
      The 360T O (Output) secondary is wound first as 4 or 5 insulated layers
   followed by the 31T D (Drive) and 17T F (Feedback) windings.  There are
   insulating layers between each of the windings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of turns were estimated without disassembly as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       The wire sizes were determined by matching the diameters of the visible
     ends of the wire for each winding to magnet wire of known AWG and/or
     measuring with a micrometer where possible.  (The Drive windings are
     actually wound using square cross-section magnet wire for maximum packing
     density.  This was estimated to be equivalent to #13 AWG round wire.)
       <p>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       The number of turns in the Output winding was determined based on its
     measured resistance, core diameter, and the wire gauge tables.
       <p>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       The inverter was run and the amplitudes of the signals on each winding
     were measured.  From these ratios, the number of turns were calculated.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     The transistor were marked 69-206.  ECG29 is a close match - high power
   amplifier switch - 80 V, 50 A, 300 W, Hfe 20 min.  2SD797 is another
   readily available power transistor that should work.  For PNP types,
   reverse the polarities of the power supply, C1, C2, and C3.
     <p>
      The transistors are mounted on heat sinks which form the sides of the case.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     C3 and R3 are required for starting.  Since there is no source of current
   for the bases of the transistors other than the Feedback windings, this
   provides a starting pulse to Q2 when the unit is switched on.  Ramping the
   input voltage slowly rather than using the power switch would likely result
   in the inverter behaving like an inanimate object.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Measured frequency of operation was about 56 Hz.  This is likely affected
   by nearly everything - input voltage, capacitance, core saturation, phase
   of the moon, etc.  Therefore, don't expect to drive a clock mechanism from
   this thing with any accuracy!
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     Some experimentation with component values may improve performance for
   your application.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     When testing, use a variable power supply so you get a feel for how much
   output voltage is produced for each input voltage.  Component values are
   not critical but behavior under varying input/output voltage and load
   conditions will be affected by C2 and C3, the number of turns on each of
   the windings of T1, and the gain of your particular transistors.  However,
   See note (3) about starting.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     WARNING: Output is high voltage and dangerous - even more so if you
   increase its output for true HV applications.  Over 200 W is available

    <a name="schmi10">
     Up to 350 VDC Inverter from 1.5 V Alkaline Cell
    </a>
   </h3>
   Using the basic circuit of the electronic flash unit from a disposable pocket
camera, it is possible to generate any voltage from a few V to 350 V or more
from a 1.5 V AA Alkaline battery.  (Similar modifications could be made to
other pocket camera or external flash unit circuits.)
   <p>
    The specific circuit described below is derived from the inverter used in a
Kodak "MAX" disposable camera electronic flash.  The beauty of this approach
is that the remains of these cameras are often available for the asking at 1
hour photo developing outfits since they are usually thrown away after
extracting the film (though apparently some are recycled, this is probably
the exception rather than the rule).
   </p>
   <p>
    The original
    <a href="kflashm.gif">
     Kodak MAX Flash Unit Schematic
    </a>
    and
    <a href="kflashmp.gif">
     Photo of Kodak MAX Flash Unit
    </a>
    show what you get for nothing.  All newer Kodak disposable cameras including
the "Funsaver Sure Flash" and APS (Advanced Photo System) "ADVANTIX" appear to
use a similar if not identical circuit but I haven't disassembled one of those
as yet.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is certainly useful intact for strobe and high voltage projects but for
the purposes of this discussion, all we need are T1 (which we may modify), Q1,
R1, perhaps S1 or an equivalent, C1, and D1.
   </p>
   <p>
    By rewinding the inverter transformer, any output voltage up to about 350 VDC
can be obtained from a 1.5 V Alkaline cell.  More than 350 V is probably
possible but just thinking about winding the needed secondary makes me tired!
   </p>
   <p>
    The
    <a href="minips.gif">
     Mini Power Supply Based on Modified Kodak MAX
Inverter
    </a>
    shows the simplified circuit for a low voltage version.
The original circuit board can be
used and is very convenient though a more compact unit can be constructed if
you use a bit of perf board or your on PCB.  The output is taken across C2
(between +V and -V) so the voltage rating of C2 must be greater than the
maximum output of the circuit.  In the original photoflash, its value was
160 uF at 350 V.  But for the inverter, the uF value of C2 can be much
smaller since it's only used as a filter capacitor.  As drawn, the output
voltage tops off at around 5 to 6 VDC with a fresh AA battery
1.5 V).  Q1, the 2SD965, is a rather special high current high gain
low voltage NPN transistor.  Using a 2N3904 rather than the 2SD965
will NOT work well, if at all!  D1 should have a PRV rating 3 or 4
times the output voltage and the transformer needs to be insulated
for the output voltage.  The other components on the primary side
are nothing special.  Note that for higher voltage operation (at the
output), Q2 in the original MAX schematic may be needed.  For low voltages,
performance is much better without it.  I don't know what the
break-even point is so you may want to leave a spot for Q2 just in case
   </p>
   <p>
    The main difficulty is in disassembling T1 in a nondestructive way.  It seems
that the ferrite core is held together by an adhesive which is very tough and
resistant to any solvent that won't destroy the plastic bobbin and wire
insulation as well.  Therefore, you may need to sacrifice two of these - one
so that just the ferrite core can be salvaged by soaking the transformer in
some nasty solvent (maybe lacquer thinner will work) to dissolve the adhesive.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the 6 turn primary, the number of turns required on the secondary is
approximately:
   </p>
   <pre>
    N = 6 * (Vout + 1.2) / 1.2
   </pre>
   assuming a small load on the output.
   <p>
    So for 4 VDC, N = 26 (as drawn); for 50 VDC, N = 256; and for 300 VDC,
N = 1506.
   </p>
   <p>
    The original circuit topped out at about 350 VDC with N = 1750.
   </p>
   <p>
    It may be possible to use multiple output windings to provide more than one
output voltage but as will be shown below, all output power must be drawn on
the forward stroke of the converter since the flyback pulse of the reverse
stroke is needed to drive the voltage on C1 and the base of Q1 negative.
   </p>
   <p>
    I have done the modifications for the 4 VDC version by removing the original
1,750 turn secondary (I had to do this anyway so I could confirm the number
of turns for the circuit description) and replacing it with a 26 turn winding
of #32 wire.  Unfortunately, I also had to Epoxy the half dozen pieces of the
ferrite core back together after somewhat destructive disassembly but I don't
think there are any significant gaps left in the core. :-(
I've heard that soaking in Methylene Chloride for 24 hours may allow these
transformers to be disassembled without damaging the bobbin or core, but
this stuff also dissolves internal organs, so use with caution.  Alcohol
or acetone may also do the trick if given enough time.
   </p>
   <p>
    I confirmed that the transformer still worked by installing another set
of undamaged original windings and checking that it still charged and
fired the flash properly.
   </p>
   <p>
    With no load and the new windings, the output reaches about 5 V in a fraction
of a second.
   </p>
   <p>
    With a 100 ohm load, the output drops to a bit over 4 V.
   </p>
   <p>
    Following a post to sci.electronics.design suggesting this circuit as a simple
way of obtaining a dual op-amp supply from a single Alkaline cell (dual part
as yet to be tested), we have the following discussion on the theory of
operation of this circuit:
   </p>
   <p>
    (From: Tony Williams (tonyw@ledelec.demon.co.uk).)
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "That sounds about right, rough sums:
    <p>
     Q1 bottoming-V is going to vary from about 0.1V to about 0.3V on the
        forward stroke, from no-load to full-load.
    </p>
    <p>
     D1 + Q1Vbe fwd-drop is going to similarly vary from about 
        (0.7 + 0.35)V to (0.7 + 0.6)V.
    </p>
    <p>
     V/C2(NLoad) = (1.5 - 0.1)26/6 - 1.05 = 5.02V.
     <br/>
     V/C2(Fload) = (1.5 - 0.3)26/6 - 1.3  = 3.9V.
    </p>
    <p>
     4 V across 100 ohms is about 160 mW, not bad really.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, I still haven't seen what recharges C1 negatively. Some scope
    waveforms for C1 and D1 would be nice (hint, hint). :)"
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   After noting that I was impressed that both our numbers work as well as they
do, Tony replied:
   <blockquote>
    "Don't be, it was a pure fluke.  The V-drops were only guesstimated and 
   things like primary IR-drop were not even included."
   </blockquote>
   Well, IR-drop should be negligible - 4 inches of #26 wire is only about .013
ohms :-).
   <p>
    Some additional info (after I took the hint) finally appears to have solved
the mystery:
   </p>
   <p>
    I checked the waveform across B-E of Q1.  It is around .6 V for most of the
cycle with strong -6 V going spikes!  So, where are they coming from????
   </p>
   <p>
    Possible sources include:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Transformer (T1) Interwinding capacitance.
    </li>
    <li>
     Circuit board capacitance.
    </li>
    <li>
     Diode (D1) junction capacitance.
    </li>
    <li>
     Diode (D1) reverse conduction.
    </li>
   </ul>
   I thought that maybe the relatively long recovery time of the standard-looking
(though unknown markings) diode (D1) is providing enough reverse current to
turn off the transistor.  I tested this by subbing both a fast recovery
and high efficiency rectifier - no difference. OK, well maybe just a bit
better performance :-).  Perhaps it still is the reverse current spike as the
transistor switches off that drives the base hard to -6 V.
   <p>
    Now, here is the kicker (no pun....):
   </p>
   <p>
    Monitoring the waveform ACROSS D1 - do you want to guess what it looks like?
   </p>
   <p>
    We have a greater than 110 V, 200 ns spikes occurring when Q1 switches off!
Geez! 110 V from a 26 turn winding and a 1.5 V battery!  It wouldn't take much
capacitance or reverse recovery leakage through D1 to drive the base and C1
negative by 6 V.  Looking at the equivalent circuit:
   </p>
   <pre>
    X pF         470 pF
      &gt;110 V pulse o-------||-----+------||------+
        ~200 ns                   |             _|_
                                  o              -
                             ~6 V pulse
   </pre>
   X of about 26 pF would result in an appropriate divider ratio.  However, this
sounds high for the layout and 26 turns.  Then again, stranger things have
happened :-).  But, a combination of the reverse recovery conduction and
higher capacitance at low voltage as the diode reverses could probably do it.
   <p>
    Tony replies to this new information:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "You will recall that I was puzzled about energy transfer on the fwd stroke
   only.  That transformer is going to get stored energy on every fwd stroke,
   and yet there appears to be no means of dissipating that energy..... There
   is even no protection for the collector of the transistor. In fact, I would
   suspect that that is part of the design, in that they did not want the
   energy clamped by the primary, they needed it as a high voltage reverse
   dissipation in the secondary.
    <p>
     Think varactor-action. For D1 being spiked from fwd conduction to 110 V
   negative I would suspect that a 26pF-equivalent for D1 is quite reasonable.
   Bearing in mind that we have an inherent reverse-Vbe clamp I would not even
   be surprised if D1 could also be allowed to avalanche."
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   I just wonder how this design came about. The vast majority of these simple
flash inverter circuits use the traditional blocking oscillator topology with
a separate winding or portion of a winding for the base drive/feedback.  (At
this point I have taken a look at over a dozen different types.)  This
Kodak circuit appears to be unique in letting the high voltage (originally)
winding serve double duty.  It probably does save 5 cents in the manufacturing
cost of the transformer by not having to have a separate winding. :-).
   <p>
    And, Tony's reply:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    "I worked for a chap once (one Jevon Crossthwaite, about 70 now if still
   alive) who could take a circuit and absolutely *squeeze* the last ounce of
   performance out of it. This is typical of what he would get up to.  I did
   learn a lot from him, but only partially, because my inbuilt design nature
   is still yer brick outhouse.
    <p>
     If there are any BOFs around; I think Jevon Crossthwaite, in his
   early days, worked for Sylvania and for George Philbrick (before
   and after Teledyne entered the scene), both in the States."

   <p>
    I'm building a super strobe bar!   It has 8 strobe tubes under computer
control.  (Actually a PIC processor, but hey, computer is a computer.)
I have all the stuff done except the control section, and I only have
2 of the 8 strobe units done due to the fact that I haven't found any
more cheap cameras at the thrift store! (One Saturday morning's worth of
garage sales and flea markets would remedy that! --- sam).
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    It runs on 12 V, at up to 6 A, and can fire the tubes at a rate of about 8-10
times per second.  The storage cap is a 210 uf, 330 V model; it gets to about
250 V to 300 V before firing; depending on how long it has had to charge.
Because of this high speed, the tubes get shall we say, a little warm. (Well,
maybe a lot warm --- sam).  I have it set up at the moment driving two
alternating 5 W-s tubes.  I'm pumping them quite a bit too hard, as the
electrodes start to glow after oh, about 5 seconds or so of continuous use.
I know, a high class problem, indeed!  My final assembly will have 8 tubes
spaced about 8 inches apart on a 2x4, with a Plexiglass U-shaped enclosure
with a nice 12 V fan blowing air through one end of the channel to cool the
inverter and the tubes.  Stay tuned.

     Teeny Tiny Inverter Design

   </h4>
   <p>
    I have developed a cool little transformer circuit that seems to be
very efficient.  I built this inverter as tiny as I could make it.
It runs off of 3V, and charges up a little 1 uf 250V cap all the way up in
about 30 seconds; drawing about 5 to 8 mA in the process.  The numbers by the
windings tell the number of turns.  The primary and feedback windings are
#28, while the secondary is #46.  Yes, #46!  I could hardly tell what
gauge it was, as it was almost too small to measure with my micrometer!
It may be #44 or #45, but at these sizes, who knows?  I used a trigger
transformer for the wire.  I used all the wire on it, to be exact; it
all
    <b>
     JUST
    </b>
    fit on the little bobbin.  The primary went on the core first,
then the secondary, and finally the feedback winding.  This order is
very important.  I used a ferrite bobbin and corresponding ferrite 'ring'
that fit on it.  The whole shebang was less than 1 cm in diameter, and
about 3-5 mm high!  I gave it a coat of wax to seal things up, and made
the inverter circuit with surface-mount parts, which I then waxed onto the
top.  There are two wires in, and two wires out.  It's enough to run a
neon fairly brightly at 1.2 V, with a 3 ma current draw.

   <h3>
    Ultra-Compact 350 V Capacitor Charger
   </h3>
   These two circuits are based on the inverters from disposable camera flash
units.  While not having quite the fewest components, they have an advantage
in that a simpler inverter transformer like the one in the
   <a href="kflashm.gif">
    Kodak MAX Flash
   </a>
   with a single primary and single
secondary winding can be used.  (Some of the other flash inverters require
either a separate feedback winding or an additional tap for the feedback.)
Even so, the total space for either of these circuits excluding the battery,
power switch, and energy storage capacitor may be less than 0.1 cubic inch!
And the cost may be $0.00.
   <p>
    The schematics are shown in
    <a href="uc350vc.gif">
     Ultra-Compact 350 V Capacitor
Charger
    </a>
    .  The only differences between the circuits are whether
the HV output is positive or negative with respect to the input and whether
one side of the battery and HV are in common.  Otherwise, they should behave
in a similar manner.  (The Kodak MAX is negative output type 1).
The versions using 2SD879 or 2SD965 (NPN) transistors
for Q1 have both been tested and appear to work about equally well, charging
a 120 uF 350 V photoflash capacitor (C2) to 350 V in about 10 seconds.  (The
10 uF C2 shown is just an arbitrary example.).  This was at least as fast as
the original flash using the same transformer.  The actual transformer used
for these tests is from a newer flash and is somewhat smaller in size
than the one found in the original MAX.  It may be a more modern version of the
MAX since the design and PCB layout look very similar but I don't know for
sure.  (See:
    <a href="dcfu1.jpg">

    .
Please contact me via the
    <a href="emaillnk.htm">
     Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page
    </a>
    if you know for sure from which model camera this
originated.)  Using the larger transformer should
result in a faster charging speed.  The value of C1 isn't critical - almost
anything will work though values between about 200 pF and 10 nF seem to be
best.  The versions using PNP transistors should work just as well as long
as a transistor with similar gain to the NPN types are used.  (The 2SB1050
or ECG12 might work but I have not confirmed this.  The 2SA1585S and 2SB1395S,
which were the actual transistors found in two versions of the flash from
which the transformer I used were taken, oscillated but would have taken a few
    <i>
     minutes
    </i>
    to charge a 120 uF capacitor to a useful voltage.  I assume
their gain was too low.  It's also possible that low gain samples of the 2SD879
or 2SD965 would not work well in the negative output circuit but all the ones I
tried were fine though there was some variation in charging rate probably
due to variations in gain.  In the original flash circuit, an additional
transistor in a quasi-Darlington configuration where the collector of the first
transistor goes to the supply instead of the collector of the second
transistor boosts the gain.  This, of course, could be added to be sure
of reliable operation.)  If S1 is a momentary switch, the inverter will
charge to a voltage based on the uF of the energy storage capacitor (C2)
where there is no longer enough of a feedback pulse to maintain oscillation.
With a C2 of 120 uF, this is between 250 and 300 VDC.  (In the original
flash circuit, with the additional transistor, the inverter would run to well
above 300 VDC at which point the voltage limiter circuit turned it off.)
The circuit then shuts off and will not restart until S1 is pressed again.
If S1 remains on continuously, the inverter will run continuously.  At an
input of 1.5 VDC, the output will then top off at 350 to 400 VDC.  The
inverter may be shut off by shorting the base of Q1 to COM (either directly
or via a transistor).  However, note that except for the Kodak MAX
configuration, note that I've only tested the circuits with S1 on
permanently.  I do not know if all configurations will work with a
momentary switch.

    for an example of the compact construction (shown sitting on a U.S. dime).
   </p>
   <p>
    The simplest source of power for these circuits is a single AA Alkaline cell.
An alternative is the
    <a href="#schslp3">
     1.5 V Alkaline Cell Eliminator
    </a>
    .
The peak current draw is several AMPs - anything that even slightly limits
current will dramatically reduce the charging speed.  DO NOT attempt to run
on much more than 1.5 V as bad things may happen.
   </p>
   <p>
    If your circuit doesn't oscillate at all, reverse the connections to the
primary or secondary of the transformer, but not both.
   </p>
   <p>
    There appears to be a slight difference in charging speed depending on which
end of the HV winding goes to the HV rectifier.  This is likely due to the
interwinding capacitance or some other parasitic.  Try both (reversing the
primary as well) and pick the one that performs best.  I'd expect the better
one to be where the end of the HV winding goes to the HV rectifier.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other factors which affect charging rate are input circuit resistance (due to
the high current) and stray capacitance.  These circuits seemed to charge
consistently more slowly (by about 10 to 20 percent) when tested on a
solderless breadboard compared to the original flash unit or the construction
shown in the photo, above.
   </p>
   <p>
    WARNING: Almost any uF value cap charged to 350+ VDC will result in a shocking
experience if touched and may be lethal under the wrong conditions.  Take
care as potential danger of this little tiny circuit running from a 1.5 V
battery easily be underestimated!

   The first uses a bare photodiode as the sensor.  It is simpler, lower

  <li>
   An IR detector module salvaged from a TV or VCR, or purchased from Radio
  Shack or elsewhere may be used instead of a photodiode.  This will have a
  much greater dynamic range (response to both weak and powerful signals)
  than a simple photodiode.  However, some of these assume a particular
  modulation frequency and will be blind to anything else.  Power requirements
  may also be more restrictive - it may insist on regulated 12 V).

   <h3>
    IR Detector Circuit Using Bare Photodiode
   </h3>
   This IR Detector may be used for testing of IR remote controls, CD player
laser diodes, and other low level near IR emitters.  It will not have the
sensitivity or dynamic range of the approach described in the section:
   <a href="#schir2">
    IR Detector Circuit Using IR Receiver Module
   </a>
   but will
respond to all sources of IR falling within the wavelength range of the
photodiode used since there is not demodulation or coupling circuitry to get
in the way.
   <p>
    IR radiation falling on the photodiode causes current to flow through R1
to the base of Q1 switching it and LED1 on.
   </p>
   <p>
    Component values are not critical. Purchase photodiode sensitive to near
IR - 750-900 um or salvage from optocoupler or photosensor.  Dead computer
mice, not the furry kind, usually contain IR sensitive photodiodes. For
convenience, use a 9V battery for power.  Even a weak one will work fine.
Construct the circuit so that the LED does not illuminate the photodiode!
   </p>
   <p>
    The detected signal may be monitored across the transistor with an
oscilloscope.

    IR Detector Circuit Using IR Receiver Module

   This one uses an entire IR receiver module as the IR sensor.  Its sensitivity
and dynamic range will be much better than the circuit described in the
section:
   <a href="#schir1">

   since
these modules have automatic gain control circuitry built in.  However, some
modules are tuned to a particular modulation frequency and/or are AC coupled
and will not respond to all remotes or other pulsed or continuous IR sources.
   <p>
    The IR receiver module from a TV, VCR, or purchased from Radio Shack or
elsewhere, drives the base of Q1 through R1.  It may even be possible to
eliminate the transistor circuit entirely and connect the LED directly to the
module's output (in series with a current limiting resistor to Vcc or Gnd) but
that depends on the drive capabilities of the module.  You can use whatever
Vcc is required for the IR receiver module for the LED circuit as well but may
need to change the value of R2 to limit the current to the LED to less than
its maximum rating.

     Sam's 6146A RF Power Oscillator
    </a>
   </h3>
   This is a tunable RF generator based on a 6146A - a once popular "beam power
tube", which I built about 30 years ago and recently resurrected in
conjunction with my laser activities.  It is a basic Hartley oscillator
capable of at least 15 watts of RF output when powered from a 400 VDC, 100
mA power supply (of the same vintage and also recently resurrected).  My most
accurate power estimates are based on the "fluorescent lamp brightness test"
and when driving a 15 W light bulb as a dummy load. :)  The 15 W bulb runs
best when attached to a 25 turn, 1 inch diameter air-core coil inserted into
the main tuning coil (L2).  Impress kids of all ages: Look, it lights with
no wires!
   <p>
    However, depending on the tuning and loading cap settings, the oscillator may
not start when the bulb is cold (due to its much lower filament resistance
and thus too much load) and fully inserted into L2 - it must be partially
withdrawn to start up.  Much more than 15 W could likely be generated by
powering the system from a higher voltage input (the 6146A's maximum ratings
exceed 725 V and 250 mA).
   </p>
   <p>
    With the components values used, its output frequency range is about 2.5
to 5 MHz which almost actually agrees with calculations (at least within a
factor of 2. :)
   </p>
   <p>
    I make no other claims about this circuit either in terms of efficiency or
output purity - I know that it produces all sorts of harmonics which mess
up local (at least) radio and TV reception depending on the setting of its
tuning cap.

    A note about the power supply: This was probably one of my first electronics
projects, back in the days when tubes were king (but in the process of being
dethroned).  It uses an old TV power transformer, 5U4 full wave rectifier,
and a CRC filter with a dual section twist-lock electrolytic cap.  It isn't
good to put more than 500 V on a 450 V electrolytic cap: I was running the
unit on a Variac capable of 140 VAC with the supply outputting 425 VDC or so.
While adjusting the oscillator, the plate current went way down and without
regulation, the output of the power supply drifted up to 500 or 550 V.  While
my back was turned, the cap started smoking profusely and all sorts of
disgusting icky juice leaked out.  Locating a replacement that would fit
became a non-trivial exercise. :(

    CAUTION: However, note that a dimmer should not be wired to control an
outlet since it would be possible to plug a device into the outlet which
might be incompatible with the dimmer resulting in a safety or fire hazard.
   </p>
   <p>
    While designed for incandescent or heating loads only, these will generally
work to some extent with universal motors as well as fluorescent lamps down
to about 30 to 50 percent brightness.  Long term reliability is unknown for
these non-supported applications.

    Simplest Dimmer Schematic
   </h3>
   <p>
    The first schematic is of a normal (2-way) inexpensive dimmer - in fact this
contains just about the minimal number of components to work at all!
   </p>
   <p>
    S1 is part of the control assembly which includes R1.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rheostat, R1, varies the amount of resistance in the RC trigger circuit.
The enables the firing angle of the triac to be adjusted throughout nearly
the entire length of each half cycle of the power line AC waveform.  When
fired early in the cycle, the light is bright; when fired late in the cycle,
the light is dimmed.  Due to some unavoidable (at least for these cheap
dimmers) interaction between the load and the line, there is some hysteresis
with respect to the dimmest setting: It will be necessary to turn up the
control a little beyond the point where it turns fully off to get the light
to come back on again.

     Types of 3-Way Dimmers
    </a>
   </h3>
   There are at least two varieties of inexpensive 3-way style dimmer switches
which differ mainly in the switch configuration, not the dimmer circuitry.
You will probably have no reliable way of telling them apart without testing
or disassembly.
   <p>
    None of the simple 3-way dimmer controls permit totally independent dimming
from multiple locations.  With some, a dimmer can be installed at only one
switch location.  Fully electronic approaches (e.g., 'X10') using master
programmers and addressable slave modules can be used to control the intensity
of light fixtures or switch appliances on or off from anywhere in the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, for one simple, if inelegant, approach to independent dimming, see
the section:
    <a href="#schidk">
     Independent Dimming from Two Locations - Lludge

    </a>

   </p>
   <h3>
    <a name="schtwd1">
     Simple 3-Way Dimmer Schematic 1
    </a>
   </h3>
   <p>
    The schematic below is of one that is essentially a normal 3-way switch with
the dimmer in series with the common wire.  Only one of these should be
installed in a 3-way circuit.  The other switch should be a normal 3-way
type.  Otherwise, the setting of the dimmer at one location will always
affect the behavior of the other one (only when the remote dimmer is at its
highest setting - full on - will the local dimmer have a full range and
vice-versa).
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that the primary difference between this 3-way dimmer schematic and
the normal dimmer schematic shown above is the addition of an SPDT switch -
which is exactly what is in a regular 3-way wall switch.  However, this
dimmer also includes a choke (L1) and capacitor (C2) to suppress Radio
Frequency Interference (RFI).  Operation is otherwise identical to that
of the simpler circuit.
   </p>
   <p>
    This type of 3-way dimmer can be used at only one end of a multiple switch
circuit.  All the other switches should be conventional 3-way or 4-way types.
Thus, control of brightness is possible only from one location.

    <a name="schtwd2">
     Simple 3-Way Dimmer Schematic 2
    </a>
   </h3>
   The schematic below is of a 3-way dimmer with a slightly more complex
switching arrangement such that when the local dimmer is set to full on or
full off, it is bypassed.  (If you ignore the intermediate dimming range of
the control, it behaves just like a normal 3-way switch.)  With this scheme,
it is possible to have dimmers at both locations without the dimmer
circuitry ever being in series and resulting in peculiar behavior.
   <p>
    Whether this is really useful or not is another story.  The wiring would be
as follows:
   </p>
   <pre>
    Location 1             Location 2
             3-way Dimmer      A    3-way Dimmer     +---------+
                  /o----------------------o\         |  Lamp   |
    Hot o------o/    Silver 1     Silver 2   \o------|   or    |-----o Neutral

                     Silver 2  B  Silver 1           +---------+
   </pre>
   (If dimming interacts, interchange the A and B wires to the silver screws at
one dimmer).
   <p>
    This one uses a toggle style potentiometer where the up and down positions
operate the switches.  Therefore, it has 3 states: Brass to Silver 1 (fully
up), dim between Brass and Silver 1 (intermediate positions), and Brass to
Silver 2 (fully down).
   </p>
   <pre>
    Br  /o---o            Br   o---o          Br/\/o---o
  3-way dimmer is up o---o/   S1   or down o---o\  S1    or Dim o---o  S1
                             o---o                \o---o               o---o

   </pre>
   However, it is still not possible to have totally independent control - local
behavior differs based on the setting of the remote dimmer (details left as
an exercise for the reader).
   <p>
    Like the previous circuit, this dimmer also includes a choke (L1) and
capacitor (C3) to suppress Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).  It is just
a coincidence (or a matter of cost) that the 3-way dimmers have RFI filters
and the 2-way type shown above does not.

     Independent Dimming from Two Locations - Kludge #3251
    </a>
   </h3>
   Here is a scheme which will permit dimming with independent control from two
locations.  Each location will have a normal switch and a dimmer knob.  The
toggle essentially selects local or remote but like normal 3-way switches, the
actual position depends on the corresponding setting of the other switch:
   <pre>

Hot o--+---| Dimmer |----o\ /o--------o\            +---------+
       |   +--------+      /            \o----------| Fixture |------o Neutral

       |                           +--------+  |
       +---------------------------------------+
   </pre>
   As usual, the brass screw on the fixture or outlet should be connected to the
Hot side of the wiring and the silver screw to the Neutral side.
   <p>
    The dimmers can be any normal knob or slide type with an off position.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that as drawn, you need 4 wires between switch/dimmer locations.
4-way switches are basically interchange devices - the connections
are either an X as shown or straight across.  While not as common as
3-way switches, they are available in your favorite decorator colors.
   </p>
   <p>
    If using Romex type cable in between the two locations, make sure to tape or
paint the ends of the white wires black to indicate that they may be Hot as
required by Code.
   </p>
   <p>
    And, yes, such a scheme will meet Code if constructed using proper wiring
techniques.
   </p>
   <p>
    No, I will not extend this to more than 2 locations!
   </p>
   <p>
    CAUTION: However, note that a dimmer should not be wired to control an
outlet since it would be possible to plug a device into the outlet which
might be incompatible with the dimmer resulting in a safety or fire hazard.

   <h3>
    Typical Toaster Oven/Broiler
   </h3>
   Here is a schematic of a typical 'dumb'toaster oven/broiler - one without a
P5-1000 chip if you can believe such a thing exists. :)  Most of the
complexity of these simple devices is actually in the sheet metal of the toast
release mechanism!  Like the more elaborate unit described in the section:
   <a href="#schtm1">
    Toastmaster Toaster Oven/Broiler with Electronic
Controls
   </a>
   , there is a knob for control of the oven/broiler functions and
another for toast Light/Dark.  A separate lever engages the toast function
which terminates when the toast is done.  You will note that other than that
unit having an IC for toast timing, the basic circuits are almost the same.
   <p>
    Apparently, the only real difference between a "toaster oven" and a "toaster
oven/broiler" is that the latter has a means of disabling the bottom heating
element while in oven (non-timed) mode - and, of course, the price!
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The heating elements are either Calrod(tm) type or Nichrome wire coils,
  possibly enclosed in quartz tubes.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     A single knob selects OFF (full CCW, S1A open), oven temperature S1B opens
  at selected temperature), and BROIL (full CW, S1C open).  Some models may
  have a separate both/top only switch.
     <p>
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     The Toast Timer can be a mechanical timer and/or a bimetal or other toast
  temperature sensor.  Individual details will vary but when the toast is
  ready, they will both release the Toast Lever and open S2 as well as
  possibly signaling with a bell.  The Light/Dark control may vary time or
  the temperature at which toast is considered 'done'.

   <p>
    Well, for toast, at least! :)
   </p>
   <p>
    Aside from the CMOS IC based toast timer, this is a fairly basic design:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="tstovn1.gif">
      Toastmaster Toaster Oven/Broiler Schematic
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   The toast function and oven/broiler are controlled separately.  A single
Power/Temperature/Broil knob controls the oven/broiler.  This is entirely
electro-mechanical with a conventional bimetal thermostat.  Toast darkness
is based only on time using CD4541B timer chip to release a manually activated
Toast lever.  Older 'dumber' toasters often were more sophisticated in their
operation using a combination of time and temperature.  Not this one.
   <p>
    Its conventional counterpart would be identical except using a mechanical
and/or toast temperature sensor in place of the IC timer.  Despite what you
might think, the most likely failures are NOT in the 'high-tech' electronics
but the usual burnt out heating element(s), bad cord or plug, broken wires,
and tired switches.

   Here are circuit diagrams from several inexpensive rechargeable flashlights.
and an electric toothbrush.  These all use very 'low-tech' chargers so battery
life may not be as long as possible and energy is used at all times when
plugged into an AC outlet.  The electric toothbrush schematic is more
interesting since it uses a high frequency inductive coupling rather than a

   <h3>
    First Alert Series 50 Rechargeable Flashlight
   </h3>
   <p>
    This one is typical of combined all-in-one units using a lead-acid battery
that extends a pair of prongs to directly plug into the wall socket for
charging.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a really simple, basic charger.  However, after first tracing out the
circuit, I figured only the engineers at First Alert knew what all the diodes
were for - or maybe not :-).  But after some reflection and rearrangement of
diodes, it all makes much more sense:  C1 limits the current from the AC line
to the bridge rectifier formed by D1 to D4.   The diode string, D5 to D8 (in
conjunction with D9) form a poor-man's zener to limit voltage across BT1 to
just over 2 V.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Series 50 uses a sealed lead-acid battery that looks like a multi-cell
pack but probably is just a funny shaped single cell since its terminal voltage
is only 2 V.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another model from First Alert, the Series 15 uses a very similar charging
circuit with a Gates Cyclon sealed lead-acid single cell battery, 2 V, 2.5
A-h, about the size of a normal Alkaline D-cell.
   </p>
   <p>
    WARNING: Like many of these inexpensive rechargeable devices with built-in
charging circuitry, there is NO line isolation.  Therefore, all current
carrying parts of the circuit must be insulated from the user - don't go
opening up the case while it is plugged in!

I assume that R1 is actually at least in part the effective series resistance

    Similar circuits are found in all sorts of inexpensive rechargeable devices.
These have no brains so they trickle charge continuously.  Aside from wasting
energy, this may not be good for the longevity of some types of batteries (but
that is another can of worms).

    Brand Unknown (Made in China) Rechargeable Flashlight
   </h3>
   <p>
    This is another flashlight that uses NiCd batteries.  The charger is very
simple - a series capacitor to limit current followed by a bridge rectifier.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is an added wrinkle which provides a blinking light option in addition
to the usual steady beam.  This will also activate automatically should there
be a power failure while the unit is charging if the switch is in the 'blink'
position.
   </p>
   <p>
    With Sa in the blink position, a simple transistor oscillator pulses the light
with the blink rate of about 1 Hz determined by C2 and R5.  Current through R6
keeps the light off if the unit is plugged into a live outlet.  (Q1 and Q2 are
equivalent to ECG159 and ECG123AP respectively.)

    Electric Toothbrush with Inductively Coupled Charger

   This was found in an Interplak Model PB-12 electric toothbrush but similar

possible.
   <p>
    A coil in the charging base (always plugged in and on) couples to a mating
coil in the hand unit to form a step down transformer.  The transistor, Q1,
is used as an oscillator at about 60 kHz which results in much more efficient
energy transfer via the air core coupling than if the system were run at 60
Hz.  The amplitude of the oscillations varies with the full wave rectifier 120
Hz unfiltered DC power but the frequency is relatively constant.

RU1, the MOV (Metal Oxide Varistor), is the same sort of part found in a
surge suppressor and is there for the same purpose.  CR5 was not marked
but is probably a fast recovery rectifier like an FR105 since it is part
of the high frequency circuit.
    <p>
     The battery charger is nothing more than a diode to rectifier the signal
coupled from the charging base.  Thus, the battery is on constant trickle
charge as long as the hand unit is set in the base.  The battery pack is a
pair of AA NiCd cells, probably about 500 mA-h.

     For the toothbrush, a 4 position switch selects between Off, Low, Medium, and
High (S1B) and another set of contacts (S1A) also is activated by the same
slide mechanism.  The motor is a medium size permanent magnet type with carbon

    Solar Powered Walk Light
   </h3>
   This was found in a Malibu(tm) LZ1 Solar light set made by Intermatic.  It
uses a solar cell, approximately 4 square inches in area, to charge a pair of
AA NiCd cells during the day which powers a superbright yellow LED at night.
I estimate the actual light output to be 2 or 3 mW at around 595 nanometers
wavelength (something like stoplight yellow).  Actually, it is kind of cool
in more ways than one! :)  If only the cheap plastic enclosure was actually
waterproof....

   When there is enough voltage from the solar cell, Q1 is turned on and Q2
(the LED driver) is turned off.  As far as I can tell, there is nothing to
actually limit current to the LED except for the combination of battery,
transistors, LED, and wiring resistance.  Both transistors could probably
be replaced with 2N3904s.  So, if you were duplicating this thing, I'd
recommend adding something to control the current to the LED or at least
checking it first!
   <p>
    Actual failure of this complex device would most likely be due to worn out
NiCd cells or corrosion to due exposure to the weather.
   </p>
   <p>
    Operational problems like weak output or inadequate lighting time could be due
to insufficient Sunlight (the thing is installed under a bush!) or extended
cloudy conditions.  Of course, these don't produce a huge amount of light in
any case!

not sure what purpose D7, D8, R1, and R2 serve, but the rest is fairly

    is from a
fluorescent wall fixture.
   </p>
   <p>
    Despite the small size and modest component count, this circuit was 
deceptively tricky to trace and make sense of. It's been cleverly 
engineered to be very cheap to produce, which leads to an unusual and 
difficult to follow design.
   </p>
   <p>
    The design is based on the UBA2021P, which is a "630 V driver IC for CFL
and TL lamps" from NXP Semiconductors.
It is designed to operate one 42 Watt compact fluorescent 
lamp, specifically the LOA 9142B which has a standard medium screw base 
containing the starting capacitor. General operation is described in the 
UBA2021P datasheet, the majority of the circuit being very similar to 
the reference design they give. The main difference being the photo 
control circuit consisting of D3, D4, Q1, Q2, R3, C6, and CDS1.
   </p>
   <p>
    Two separate charge pumps fed by the output of the half bridge provide 
Vcc to the UBA2021P and the photo control respectively. The first, 
formed by D1, D2, and C9 has the output filtered by C4 and feeds Vcc of 
the IC. The second, formed by D3, D4, and C8 with the output filtered by 
C6 provides power to the photo control. As light falls on the CdS, the 
impedance drops, pulling Vcc down. Transistors Q1 and Q2 form an SCR, 
also connected across Vcc and Ground, with the gate being pulled up by 
the output of D3 and down by R3. I don't fully understand what happens 
here, but from what I can tell, as Vcc drops due to the load imposed by 
CdS1, the output of D3 rises, causing Q2 to conduct which pulls down the 
base of Q1 causing Q1 to conduct, latching to shunt Vcc fully to ground, 
causing IC1 to shut down. When CdS1 is dark, the resistance rises, 
allowing Vcc to rise, IC1 starts up, and R3 keeps the SCR formed by Q1 
and Q2 turned off.

   <p>
    The sequential flasher circuit is very old, going back to the 1950s at
least.  Operation follows classic neon light theory.  As the voltage
rises on the lamps, one will reach threshold first, and fire.  That
drops the voltage (via caps) on the two connected lamps, and to a
lesser degree on the lamps those are connected to.  The caps will
charge through the resistors and one of the far lamps will finally
reach threshold and fire.  The process goes on from there.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you really want a strange one, draw 5 points in a circle.  Then
draw lines between the points.  You will have a star inside of a
pentagon.  Replace each line with a 0.1 uF cap.  Replace each point
with a neon lamp and resistor.  Resistor goes to +v and lamp.  Other
side of lamp to ground. (polarity doesn't really matter, just needs
DC).  Similar to your circuit, except more caps.
   </p>
   <p>
    Power it up and the bulbs will flash in some 5 step pattern, which
will repeat until you interrupt power.  Only one lamp on at a time.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are a whole lot of neon lamp circuits like this one.  It is
possible to build logic elements and flip-flops from them.  I suppose
one could build a computer with enough parts, although I don't know of
anyone who had the patience.

     1.5 V LED Circuits

   </h3>
   Here are a pair of circuits that will light an LED when powered from a single
1.5 V alkaline cell.  They should also operate on the 1.2 V output of a NiCd
or NiMH cell as well as from a supercapacitor or ultracapacitor charged to
1 to 1.5 V.

    Both circuits and the descriptions below have been contributed by: Andre

     1.5 V LED Flasher
    </a>
   </h4>
   This circuit utilizes the voltage doubling principle to flash an LED from a
1.5 source like a single alkaline cell.  In addition, it can be dark activated
by gating pin 5 of U1 with an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and resistor.
The current drain is less than 40 uA between flashes.  The LED current is
50 mA peak so it's quite bright.
   <p>
    The original source for this circuit is from the ZSCT1555 Application Notes
and a standard voltage doubler which was slightly modified so I could use a
resistor instead of a diode.  Not exactly new, but just a novel use of
existing components as it isn't in any literature since the standard 555
timer works down to 3 V whereas this one works down to 0.9 V.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using a 1 Farad supercapacitor charged to 1.5 V as the power source, the LED
flashed for about eight hours.  There was no change in oscillator frequency
and the brightness stayed constant down to about 1.0 volts.

    With only a minor modification (increase C2 to 0.1 uF) a similar
flasher can be built with a MAX660.  This provides a slightly higher output
current and it will flash reliably with a larger time delay between flashes
(like up to a minute with a 3.3 uF capacitor).

    </li>
    <li>
     If it's low current you are after, the circuit will work with an LED
 series resistor.  You can also use a N channel JFET with gate wired to
 source in series with the LED in order to limit the flash current to
 between 1 and 3 mA.  Also, use a tantalum bead capacitor for C1.
 It works well and allows the 7660 to run from up to 24 VDC down to 5 VDC.  I
 set one up last night and it works well using a 4069 as the flasher and it
 draws 10 uA.

     I have tested this circuit and it runs from a 4 F supercapacitor for eight

 use a constant current source in series with a 1 F, 5.5 V supercapacitor in
 order to maximize the flash time.

     Brinkmann LED Light

   </h3>
   This uses a single white LED to implement something that looks like a
flashlight though it probably wouldn't win any awards for brightness.  The
challenge in such a circuit was to run a white LED with a 4+ V drop off a
pair of AA batteries.  This cute little circuit does it.  In fact, it will
run (at reduced brightness) at 1.5 V or less.  See:
   <a href="bledl1.gif">
    Brinkmann LED Light
   </a>
   .
   <p>
    The oscillator circuit runs at about 200 kHz producing a more or less
squarewave voltage waveform across the LED with a peak of 4.5 to 5 V
on fresh AA batteries.  At reduced input voltage, the frequency is a bit
lower and there is a longer low time as well as slightly reduced peak
voltage.

    However, note that unless the potentiometer used is well behaved near

     Nearly Full Range Pulse Width DC Controller
    </a>
   </h3>
   This circuit will drive a resistive DC load with an output from about 2 to
98 percent duty cycle.  As drawn, the load voltage is assumed to be between
20 and 30 VDC with a maximum current of about 5 A.  A standard-blow fuse
with a current rating just slightly above the expected maximum average
current should be provided in series with the power supply.
   <p>
    PWM1 is based on the SG3525 PWM controller IC, normally used for switchmode
power supplies.  While a 555 timer can implement a similar capability, I
don't know of a simple setup that provides an output that has the same wide
range and linearity.
   </p>
   <p>
    With trivial changes, a wide range of other types of loads can be
accommodated.  With LC smoothing filter, inductive loads like DC motors
can be used.  The pot can be replaced with an external signal input if
desired.  Or, a voltage derived from the output can be fed into
the error amplifier instead to provide closed-loop regulation.  Using
a voltage derived from a sense resistor in the source return can be
used to implement a current regulated drive.
   </p>
   <p>
    The SG3525 (U1) will run with supply voltages above 30 VDC, so the zener
circuit really isn't essential.  Alternatively, if the output needs to be
lower or higher, U1 can be powered from a separate supply.

    Note: While I show the unused inputs floating and it works that way, it

     Electronic Ford Mustang Clock Controller Retrofit
    </a>
   </h3>
   A number of vintage Ford Mustang automobile models used an electromechanical
clock mechanism, basically a mechanical escapement with an electromagnetic
pulser to wind it periodically (something like 45 seconds between pulses).
After awhile, since the full current to the
electromagnet passes through the contacts, they become pitted, the clock
stops, and it's possible that it will end up with current running through
the coils overheating and ruining them as well as draining the battery.
To remedy this while maintaining
the authentic "click" of the periodic rewind, here is the schematic for a
circuit that only uses the contacts to turn on a power MOSFET
that provides the winding kick from an energy storage capacitor bank.
A prototype of this design has been running continuously for over
6 years while keeping perfect time.
   <p>
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Get the schematic for MCM in PDF format:

     </a>
     .
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The original contacts provide the current to initiate a winding pulse but
do not carry any significant current.  Thus, even worn pitted contacts will
probably be adequate with a simple cleaning.  Even if the the winding kick
fails to occur for some reason, nothing will be damaged.  The START button
must be pressed the first time and can then be removed. :)  When the contacts
close, Q1 turns which pulses Q2 to dump the charge on C1,C2,C3 through
winding coil.  This provides about 45 seconds of run time at which point
the cycle repeats.
   </p>
   <p>
    The starting button is not directly across the contacts because it would
only be used when the contacts are actually closed.  So, it actually forces
Q1 to turn off when depressed and then pulses it like the normal contacts
when released.
