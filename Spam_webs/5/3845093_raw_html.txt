                 It has come to my attention this morning, that some folks were surprised, and even disappointed, that the full moon this week, wasnt pink. Apparently a number of people were hoping that the strawberry moon was indeed a time that it would some how look like a strawberry, or at least be red or pink in color.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Ummm that is not how it works. Here is a really quick refresher on the moon names. Generally the moon names (which differ by location, tribe, belief system) has to do with what is, or was happening on the ground at that time. Could be that it was the time of year that trapping or hunting was happening; or that the harvest was fully in swing. Or as in this case, the season of strawberries, being ready to be picked fresh from your garden and enjoyed; thus a strawberry moon.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I wrote about the moons, and their names, and how you can choose what you are celebrating, back in December, looking ahead at 2015. You can find that post

                 I am glad though, to see so many people looking up at the moon, and enjoying her!

                Could be when an airline boots a family off, or a cop knocks a suspect to the ground, or a person is causing mayhem. There are no real limits. And in today's society it seems most everyone has a cell phone on them; that shoots video, and or audio.
               </span>
               <br/>
               <font size="2">
                <br/>
                But what about when you dont have your phone, or the time to get it out? Or maybe you just dont feel comfortable, or safe recording what is happening. What are some of the other things you can do, to make you a better witness? And what about when you are not sure if what you are witnessing is a crime, or just an odd behavior? You dont have to have all of the answers, to be a good, and credible witness; or to make a difference.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Was the person a man, or a woman? Did they have hair? What color? How long? Anything stand out about it? How old was the person? What color was the person's skin? What were they wearing? Did anything stand out? Hat? Glasses? Sunglasses? What about facial features, that is something that cant be altered as easily as removing a hat. Or a tattoo?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Some of those questions are hard to answer, like how old, and what color skin. And you dont have to have all of the answers; and dont feel like you have to have an answer at all.
                <u>
                 I dont know, is an actual answer
                </u>
                . And ranges count too. A range answer is something like,
                <em>
                 I dont know late 20s, early 30s probably
                </em>
                . And questions about skin color are tricky.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Other things that are helpful are height, and weight. You have seen the marks on the doors at convenience stores, that make it easier at a glance to see a persons height. That works out in the world too. If I am standing here, and the person there, and they are as tall as the window, that gives a good accurate description, that height can be judged from. You dont have to say 6 4. Me personally, I am terrible at guessing weight, height, and nationality, in a calm environment among friends; it is safe to assume my guesses are even worse when under stress. That doesnt make me a bad person, or a bad witness; it is simply an honest reflection of some of my limitations.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What time is it? Who else did you see, they may have had a better angle, they may have talked to the person, they may have better information than you do. How did the person leave? Were they walking, running, on a bicycle, in a car, or truck? Do you know what color it was? Maybe you cant tell a Dodge from a Ford, and that is okay; but you probably can tell 4 doors or 2. Was there a bumper sticker? You dont have to know what it said, but was there something that stood out? A red rectangle sticker on the bumper. Was the car stopped already? Did the person slow down at all? Speed up? Stop at the corner?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Did the person say anything? How about the officer? Speak in an odd way? With an accent? A deep voice? High pitched? Tell you something, like a justification? That could look like seeing a person in your neighbor's yard, when you know they are at work, the person sees you notice them and has a story ready like
                <em>
                 I am his niece, visiting from out of town
                </em>
                , or
                <em>
                 I am here to check the cable
                </em>
                , but they have no uniform or truck.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You dont have to be the hero, you dont have to have all of the answers. Do stay calm, stay safe (and sometimes that means leaving an area, or hiding) and be honest. Often it is one simple thing, that helps.
                <em>
                 The shoe laces were a bright green, I was under the desk, and that was all I saw, bright green shoe laces
                </em>
                ; that really could be the end of the detail, but it adds a piece to the puzzle.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Your safety comes first, and if you have a concern or a suspicion, its okay to call and report it. Very seldom in life do we have the whole picture, instead we have a small part of it. It is important to remember that is okay, that is normal, and
                <u>
                 it is not helpful for you to fill in the missing details
                </u>
                . Stick to the basics, the facts, and remember
                <strong>
                 I dont know, is an acceptable answer.
                </strong>

                Do you ever feel overwhelmed, or underprepared, when it comes to documents? Even the ones that other people seem to be casual about, or understand; do you feel like you have no idea what you are seeing, or what to even look for on the page?
                <br/>
                If that is you, you are not alone. Many people feel the same way! And unfortunately it is one of those topics that can make us feel small, and that we generally dont talk about. But I have a solution for you. A simple way to give you some comfort, and some general ideas of familiarity.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Just like anything else, the first time you see something, it is unfamiliar, and the more often you see it, or interact with it; the more familiar you become. In the same way a child learns where to place their name on a sheet, after the word name; we as adults learn what types of information are needed on forms. And more importantly what is not needed. Too often forms have become a way to get people to easily comply with providing additional details, that are not needed.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Here is what you do,
                <span style="">
                 <a href="http://dld.bz/dEspt" target="_blank">
                  click this link
                 </a>
                </span>
                , and go have a look at some of the legal forms. As they are, blank, and neutral. It is much easier to look at a form, and see it for what it is, the bones of a document; when it is neutral, and not needed in the moment. Having a look at them gives you an idea of the natural flow, and the necessary components.
                <br/>
                <span style="">
                </span>
                <br/>
                When we are in the moment, and nervous, or excited, about what we are about to sign, that is the wrong time to learn. Sometimes it is the best we got, and sometimes it is the necessity. But it is a lot easier to miss some details, that could protect us, and our interests, in the long run. Most lawyers will tell you, read it all, even the small print; and dont sign anything you dont understand. But the day to day reality, for many people is we dont follow either of those directives, even when we know that is the best practice.
                <br/>
                <span style="">
                </span>
                <br/>
                When you click on the link (
                <span style="">
                 <a href="http://dld.bz/dEspt" target="_blank">
                  here it is again
                 </a>
                </span>
                ) you can see a variety of legal documents, forms, and contracts. So if you are looking at renting something, or becoming a roommate; or maybe you have a child that is going to camp, or a new daycare, read through some of the documents. Play with them a little if you want, fill in the information, and update the form, and read through it. Maybe too you have a loved one that was just diagnosed with cancer, or some other big disease, and you are thinking about wills, or end of life choices; this is a simple way to see some of what you should be thinking about.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It is simple, pressure free, and allows you to look and learn; in private, quietly, and to raise your comfort zone. May you never be under stress, or duress, and need to sign something legal; but the reality is you probably will be, those are the odds. That is okay, just make the time in advance to give yourself a little comfort. That is one of the amazing, and wonderful gifts of the internet, it levels the playing field in many ways. It allows you access to things that you used to have to pay for, or find a professional to share the information with you. Now you can empower yourself, and your loved ones.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                One last note, if you are thinking,
                <em>
                 umm I dont even know what I would need to go look at
                </em>
                ; thats okay, you dont have to know. Just go snoop around some,
                <span style="">
                 <a href="http://dld.bz/dEspt" target="_blank">
                  link
                 </a>
                </span>
                follow your instincts, and look around, you are only spending your time. I think you will see there are a lot of core basics, to look for on many of the forms. And remember, its often up to you, and you alone, to protect your interests. Knowledge is power, and if you cant afford an attorney on speed dial, then it is important to spend a little time raising your knowledge base.

                If you are a parent, then you have already probably encountered a medical release question. Or at the very least you have thought about one. If, heaven forbid, something awful happens to your child, and you are not there, who decides what happens next?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This can be difficult, its one thing if your child is at school, or daycare, and you are nearby. The care provider can call 911, and call you, and you can head to the emergency room. But what if you are travelling for business, and the unthinkable happens?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What if you send your child to camp, and for whatever reason that is the day you are away too, and no one can reach you. Or you send your child to your parents for the summer, or away to school. This is the stuff that nightmares are made of, for many parents.
                <br/>
                <span style="">
                </span>
                <br/>
                But a good quality medical consent, can make sure your child get the treatment you would want them to have; and can make a difference in peace of mind, and ease of access. And something to know is that
                <u>
                 it in no way, at all, gives up any of your parental rights. None of them, in any way, shape or form
                </u>
                . It is simply a temporary permission slip for the person you are trusting your child with, to be able to get them medical care.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There are some things to know, for example the guardian needs to be 18 or older. The paperwork needs to be for the state the child will be in. So if you live in Idaho, but are sending your child to Oregon for the summer, you want to have authority there, for the guardian. You also need the parent, or parents to sign it, in front of a witness.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There are other names for the form like:

                And NO this is not the same thing as a child travel consent, that gives someone permission to travel with your child. (

                </a>
                ) Instead the medical consent lets the legal guardian authorise anesthesia, or medication, x-rays.

                 You can see a form at this link
                </a>
                , and you can change it to the state you need it for, and then scroll down a little and click on the Update Preview button and see an example. If you put in your information, it will update it with your name in there, so you can see what it looks like.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Lastly I want to say, this goes both ways. I was often surprised, as I raised my two children; at how many people trusted me with their kids, that I never even met. I get it I was the neighborhood mom, but I often was worried about what if and if a child spent the night, or weekend, and I couldnt reach the parents, I often was in a place of
                <em>
                 well thank the gods you are just late, and its not that your child is hurt or injured
                </em>
                .
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you are the parent, plan ahead; and if you are a caretaker, or guardian, you plan ahead too! Kids get into the most amazing predicaments, and too often the simplest thing, causes an injury. They fall out of a tree, and scare you to death; yet jump up and are fine. But they trip over the curb, going to the car to go for ice cream, and break their arm.

                 Does your town have a police ombudsman?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 An ombudsman is a person who is appointed to independently investigate complaints made by individuals, of abuses, and or capricious* acts, against officials, or people in power. They have wide investigative powers, and they are charged with getting all of the facts.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 That means a police ombudsman, in your community, does not work for the police department, they are in fact independent of the department. Their job is to take complaints, and concerns, from the public; and then investigate it, and make a decision as to what really happened, and recommendations of what comes next.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Many people think this is not an effective tool, and the person is really just on the side of the police, and that nothing will come of it. But that is simply not true. Each of those statements is in fact wrong; but its very easy to understand why people have those negative feelings. And a lack of trust in the system. This office however is to the side of the system, it is not part of the police department.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Boise, Idaho is an example of a place where an ombudsman made a huge difference; in the community, in the police department, and in the county. I would even go so far as to say that it made a difference regionally, with other areas able to look in at the success story there.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 In the beginning people (myself included) thought it was a ridiculous waste of energy, and time, where the police would just get a finger shaken at them, and be told that was a naughty naughty no no and then everything would go back to how it was before. And how things were, was not good. There was a lack of trust, there was escalated violence, there were a lot of problems.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But I was wrong, and I openly admit it. I was wrong, and so were many others, and I am glad we were. Boise hired a man named Pierce Murphy, who was great at what he did; he came in with a lot of people not believing it would work. He had a tough job, not a lot of support, and yet he made a difference. Boise has lost him to another community, he had moved onward and upward in his professional career.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 This is a link to the Boise offices website
                 <a href="http://www.boiseombudsman.org/" title="">
                  <span style="">
                   http://www.boiseombudsman.org/
                  </span>
                 </a>
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Take some time to go have a look at the site, there are even forms there for you to look at, and use. And if your community doesnt have an ombudsman yet, consider bringing this solution forward. A good first step would be to talk to your city council, and that can be as simple as calling them and leaving a message, sending a letter, or going to speak at the next meeting.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 An ombudsman can provide a lot for a community, and give a voice to the powerless, and to those that are afraid to speak up, or feel like there is no one they can tell. There are options available, and this is an excellent one in many communities. This is a good example of what hearing from the people, and working for the people, looks like in action.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 One last note, this is not about attacking the police department. Instead this is about making justice, just, and not arbitrary* or rogue. It can also be about realizing that the department has let their officers down, by not providing training or resources, in a certain area. An impartial look at the conflicts, can become a win win; a win fo rthe community, and a win for the department. This is an office that is focused on facts, and outcomes, from an impartial place. It is not about taking sides, just the side of truth.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 *An act is arbitrary and capricious if a reasonable person, considering all the evidence, would fairly and honestly be compelled to reach a different conclusion.

                 Its Mothers Day here in the states. I have to admit I am torn about this holiday, and many others like it; I call them Hallmark holidays. A day to go spend money on someone, get the right card, or gift, and make the right phone call. As a mom, and now a granny, I truly understand the holiday fully.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But here is the problem, it is a tough reminder on little kids that dont have a mommy. Mommy died, or mommy left; and the same thing happens to kids next month that are without a daddy. Plus days like today are a cruel reminder to the women that want desperately to have a child, but infertility has made that elusive, and heart breaking.  And there are moms in the military, serving away from their kids, today too.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I remember too, being a young mom, a single mom, with a deadbeat ex husband as the father of my two children. He didnt pay child support, and money was tight, really tight. And I remember needing to make time, and money, to let my kids each have a dollar, so we could go to the dollar store, and they could shop for a gift for me.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We made it fun, it was thoughtful, it was an adventure, we made it that way; it was our way. And I often wouldnt know what the gift was, letting them go pay alone, and me not peaking; and then making sure they had tape, and paper to wrap the gift.
                 <br/>
                 <span style="">
                 </span>
                 <br/>
                 I worked really hard to make sure they were raised knowing that its never about a day marked on a calendar, it is about everyday. It is about us, our love, our committment to each other. Not gifts, but about how we show up as people.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And then my own mother, we have not always been close. And this year is our last, and I honestly wasnt sure she would even still be here for it. You see she was given 8 weeks to live, maybe 12; and this past Friday was day one, of week nine. She doesnt need a card, or a dust catching gift. She has been having to go through her things, like her jewelry, and decide how to let it go, and to who, or where.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So Mothers Day, has a lot of layers, and they arent all pretty, and they dont all feel good. Too often we forget that I think. And so while it is fun, that my 6 year old grand, wants me to help her make her mommy breakfast in bed in the morning (on the silver tray and just because she needs me to boil the water in her plan) and it will be some good memories, its not my focus.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And while I had a lovely surprise of my children together last night, cupcakes, food, gifts, that is not my focus either. I am still committed to the idea that in our family it is about all of us, the team, today, and everyday. And I am choosing instead to highlight charities, and nonprofits that do good stuff for moms, everyday. The moms that are in crisis centers, that left for safety with the clothes on their backs; the moms that have babies in NICU; the moms that are grieving loss; the moms that are in prison and trying to be mom. The organizations that show up everyday, not just once a year, and focus on the moms in our society.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 much love
                 <br/>

               In business the problem usually isnt that we dont know, it is instead in
               <em>
                doing
               </em>
               what we know, that we should be doing. The internet is an excellent resource for a lot of good information (and misinformation too, lets be honest) and it makes it readily available. Perhaps though it is too available.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Too often we get sidetracked in our inbox, or on a search online for how to do something, better, faster, cheaper. And that costs us, because we get stuck in searching instead of doing, or in perfecting, instead of completing.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So how do we gain more skills, not miss the new shiny thing that actually benefits us,
               <strong>
                and
               </strong>
               get anything done? It feels almost impossible some days. We used to have to deal with interruptions at our desk, and the phone ringing, well we still have that, and now we also have instant messages, social media, and an inbox, and an online inbox, and the mailman comes too.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               At the end of the day many people feel tired, frustrated, overwhelmed, and like they wish there were at least two of them. Many sit and think,
               <em>
                does my boss know how many things are on my desk, and that I am just one person
               </em>
               ? And have a good attitude and smile during all of it, hey no pressure, right? Then there are the home pressures, paying the bills, cooking, cleaning, and family life, and maybe a social life. You remember a social life, it happens off line, with actual people, face to face, and involves fun.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Here is a
               <strong>
                3 step system for getting out of overwhelm, and getting more done
               </strong>
               .
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">
                1) Use your planner and plan days in chunks, and then stick to it. Jack Canfield talks about this concept in his book
               </span>
               <span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">
                The
                <em>
                 Success Principles
                </em>
               </span>
               <span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">
                . Look at your days, mark your days off, your travel days, your solid work days, and your transition days. If you know that Monday is a day filled with meetings, and touching base with everyone on your team, dont make that be a day that you expect to get 6 hours of work done at your desk.
               </span>
               <br/>
               <br/>
               This allows you to be present, and focused, and to complete that days work. If you have a transition day, where you are handing everything off, because you will be gone, (or a day when you are getting it all back, because you have just returned) you are not going to get the same amount of work done, as you do normally. You know that, everyone knows that. Plan your schedule in advance, to win.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">
                2) Get your stuff done first. Not kinda first, not soon, not in the morning. Get your priorities done first. First thing work on your big thing, no exceptions. Not your inbox, not your phone calls, not your chat in the hallway taking the latest news, complaints, or gossip. Get your good work, your first of the day energy in on your list. Remember you should only have 3 to 5 main things you are working on, a day. More things sure, but the big core, this is where your first of day focus belongs.
               </span>
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Let your voice mail, and your inbox do their job, and file your interruptions. You will get to them, next. You do you, first.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               3) Hold yourself accountable to your boundaries. This does two things, it shows your mind you are serious about making a change in how you do business; and it helps make it easier to stay in your plan. If you make exceptions, and let yourself down, dont hold your own agreements with yourself, then your brain says
               <em>
                oh you arent that serious
               </em>
               . It also makes it easier for you to train other people that you are serious, and they will learn your new boundaries, and interrupt you less. You will be the person that they wait till 10 am to call, or ask a question to; they will learn you dont drop your own goals, and work, to respond to their email instantly. And its a simple sentence Bob I need to finish this proposal, I will be available after 11. or Mary I cant help you with that in the morning, but at 2 tomorrow afternoon I could make about 30 minutes. You are simply creating the frame, for your day, with a better plan.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Now get out there, use your planner, and make great stuff happen!

               Is doing the right thing, tied up in how you do it? Or is it attached only to how it is received? Think about that for a moment, let your answer really sink in.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The simple, and quick, answer is you are responsible for you, and your actions. The longer answer reminds you, you are responsible for you; but it can get complicated, and feel messy. The truth is it is easiest to start with something simple, something cut and dried. So lets start there, how about negotiating with a two year old? Now if you have ever spent time with an actual two year old you are probably laughing, and thinking
               <em>
                oh yeah, simple
               </em>
               !
               <br/>
               <br/>
               But lets be honest, it really is a simple example. Two year old wants to play with the knives in the drawer, nope. Two year old screams at you, yells NO at you, kicks you. You send the two year old to time out; and you repeat the sequence the next time the precious little darling, drags the chair back over to the knife drawer.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               It is simple, you are responsible for the safety of the child. You are responsible for setting safe, and firm boundaries. Your time out may look different than Jean across the street does hers, but its a set process. It doesnt matter if the child suddenly acts like a troll, lashes out, is mean, or screams as if they have lost a finger.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               It gets harder, as we deal with older people, lets say teenagers, and just go with
               <em>
                enough said
               </em>
               .
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Now lets move into the work environment, and telling someone
               <em>
                I dont appreciate your sexist jokes, they are out of line
               </em>
               . You are responsible for your tone, your words, your attitude; but you are not responsible for how it is received. (hint this is where it can feel messy) You might find that person moves to even more immature behaviors,
               <em>
                oh thats miss stick up her backside, everyone be politically correct
               </em>
               . Making you the target now, of the ignorant remarks.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Women run into this everyday in business, deciding what they can ignore, and for how long; and then how far they are willing to go to get treated decently. Dont kid yourself it is not a simple process in most places of employment, and yes it is fair to say we have moved into complicated.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               But now what about at home, at Thanksgiving, when the known uncle child molester is going to be invited, and so will all of the children? We just moved into hard, and messy. But are you responsible for all the feeling of the people that get your message, or are you simply responsible for being the one in integrity? (
               <strong>
                Hint
               </strong>
               you are not responsible to make each of the other family members feel good with your integrity.)
               <br/>
               <br/>
               One more, what about at the end of someones life, they are dying, does what you owe them change? No it doesnt. You have to still be in your integrity, yes also in compassion, but you need to stay in that place of boundaries that make the most sense for you. In this example, and the one before it, you will more than likely run into family judgements, guilt trips, and emotions.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               But when you run against your own integrity, your own standards, your own beliefs you get an added bonus of still having people judge you (because that always happens regardless of how you proceed) and you judge you. Your inner critic, is there, and you cant let that go to voicemail, and you cant just hit delete, and not read the email. That voice is part of you, and how much longer do you punish yourself with it?
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So what is the key to success with all of this? Go back to the first example, the two year old. That was simple because you had clarity. Your decision was set, and unshakeable, the judgement of others didnt matter. It didnt matter if your mother in law was there, you knew what your response was, and you followed through. Simple.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The key is to get that clarity about how you make decisions, before you need to make the decision. And that is different than knowing every scenario in advance, and micromanaging anything that might ever come up. Far from it in truth.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Instead it is about deciding what your side of the street looks like, what are the values, the standards, the deal breakers, in your life. The way you make decisions, then guides the actual decisions, when they come up, and that gives you two wonderful gifts.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Gift one is the ability to respond, instead of react; from a place of heart centered, and integrity lead choices, and boundaries. For example you might want to go for pie, after uncle child molester has left, or you might want to host your own thanksgiving instead, or you might want to skip thanksgiving all together and spend the day on a long drive.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Gift two is you dont have to stress, you can relax past the hard parts (because they still will happen) you can move through the emotion, but from a place of being centered in who
               <strong>
                <em>
                 you
                </em>
               </strong>
               are, and what you believe in. The agreements we make with ourselves can be the hardest to keep, until we learn to actually keep them, and honor ourselves. Once we decide that our core comes first, and that needs to stay intact so we can help others, then it is simple. We know what our side of the street looks like, and we are responsible for the upkeep, and that is enough. And that little voice in your head? It tells you good things, rewards you for making the decisions from your inner knowing, and values.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               For another way of looking at this concept, and the basics of it, I highly suggest the book The Four Agreements, by Don Miguel Ruiz.

               Today I am going to answer a Question from a reader; and offer a reminder to you, yes I do answer questions. So if you have one, ask it!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Question -
               <em>
                How do you come up with your content, and what do you do when you get stuck?
               </em>
               <br/>
               <br/>
               M - from Montana
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I love this question! And I have a two part answer. The first part is when you love what you do, and KNOW what you do, or are learning what you love, you are connected, and the topics are endless. Lets break those three things down, and then move on to part two of the answer.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               If you love what you do, then you are always engaged with it. There is always something to write about, because you are in action with it on a daily basis. And here is the thing, you dont have to share amazing things, or some huge ah ha . Those will come along, they will just happen, but your ah has are not the same as the readers. Your goal is to explain, to share, and to engage. This is what I do here on this blog, this is my heart center, what I really do, how I really love and live.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Next 
               <em>
                if you knowwhat you do
               </em>
               , now that might sound a little confusing, so lets break that down. If you know your topic well, your business, then there is always MORE that you can share. In fact you are often editing it down. Einstein had a quote
               <em>
                If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.
               </em>
               When you are an expert in your field there is plenty to talk about, and explain. Break it down, each topic, into the steps that are needed, all of the layers.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Let me give you an example, I have been teaching for 30 years. When we decided with the
               <a href="http://alchemycouncilweeklyedition.weebly.com/" target="_blank">
                Alchemy Council to do a weekly sharing
               </a>
               , we needed a sketch up of what that would look like. I sat down with a sheet of paper, drew columns on the page (five across), and numbered the weeks, down the side, 52 of them (a years worth). That gave me a grid of needing 5 topics a week, for a year. It took me about 40 minutes to fill that in, because I know the material, and the topics that make sense in each season. I didnt write it, all I did was make the topics list. Now the Council can, with ease, see the writing assignments for the next year.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               And the last of these three is share the journey. If you are learning the topic, you have a lot to write about too, because you are sharing where you are, where you were, and where you are headed. If you are learning, you are in motion, and that gives you content, and ideas. And it comes back to that Einstein quote again, you understand it well enough to explain it, or you talk about where you are stuck, and how you are moving around, and through, that obstacle. If you are stuck, others are too, or were in the past.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Those are the first part of the answer, now here is the second. The second part speaks to
               <em>
                yeah, yeah I get that, but you dont understand,
                <u>
                 I am stuck!
                </u>
                
               </em>
               . And I am going to be honest, this is going to come back to explaining it to your inner child, your inner 6 year old. No darling you arent stuck with content,
               <strong>
                you are stuck
               </strong>
               . You are burned out, or you are out of step of the first three, and trying to shove it in. Just like the step sisters trying to stick their foot into the small glass slipper, you are trying to shove something in that doesnt fit
               <em>
                you
               </em>
               . And yes, we are coming back to you each time, but not from blame. Instead it is about YAY YOU,
               <em>
                you have the ability to shift it immediately!
               </em>
               Because you need to move back into what you are learning, what you know, or what you love. Get back to your fit, because there you have no end to the content you can share.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               much love,
               <br/>
