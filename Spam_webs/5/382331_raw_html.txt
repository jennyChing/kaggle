      I am sometimes certain that I wait all year for tomato season, you know, the way a more normal person might be excited for the Giants to get back to the field or eagerly anticipate whatever sleek and minimal trinket Apple has coming out this fall.  But for me, its just tomatoes. I eat them on eggs, in sandwiches, cooked and raw in every possible format from paste to pasta to chili and seriously, dont even try to bring me a cream cheese-schmeared bagel without a thin slice of tomato on it. Alex did once and lets just say, it didnt go over well. Poor Alex.

       I love tomatoes so much that I even occasionally take part in the blasphemy that is sun-dried tomatoes, most of which are about as dried out in the sun as I am this weekunfortunately not the case for either of us. But lets talk about what sun-dried tomatoes aspired to be before their dreams were co-opted by food packagers and evil-minded chemists: tomatoes roasted slowly at a low temperature.

      <p>
       If youve never made slow-roasted tomatoes before, prepare to have your mind blown because theyve got very little to do with the aforementioned packaged variety in all of the best ways: theyre so flavorful that you might think you think someone snuck into your oven and doused them in both vinegar and salt, even if you did neither. They also have just the right level of moisture, dry on the outside with some juiciness left withinno rehydrating needed here. They can transform even those freakily perfect supermarket grape tomatoes into heaven on a plate, but if you manage to get your hands on the real deal from a greenmarket, well, I hope youre sitting down when you pop the first one in your mouth.

       And what to do with them? Namely, anything. Dorie Greenspan uses hers as a

       , or stores them in the fridge covered in olive oil, laying them over chicken, salmon, tuna or mixed vegetables. Heidi at 101 Cookbooks puts them in

       . And I put them in my mouth. Or mix them with white beans or slivers of basil. Or in my mouth. Or in salad. But mostly in my mouth.

       Oh look, I was gushing over the
       <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/08/summer-loving/">
        exact same thing.
       </a>
       Im
       <i>

       predictable.

        Slow Roasted Tomatoes

      </p>
      <p>
       I know what youre going to say: You want me to
       <em>
        turn on my oven
       </em>
       in the
       <em>
        middle of the summer
       </em>
       for three freakin hours? Are you insane? And all I can say is, well, yes, but also the oven is so low that I swear it wont heat up your apartment in any noticeable or annoying way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cherry, grape or small Roma tomatoes
       <br/>
       Whole gloves of garlic, unpeeled
       <br/>
       Olive oil
       <br/>
       Herbs such as thyme or rosemary (optional)
      </p>
      <p>
       Preheat oven to 225F. Halve each cherry or grape tomato crosswise, or Roma tomato lengthwise and arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet along with the cloves of garlic. Drizzle with olive oil, just enough to make the tomatoes glisten. Sprinkle herbs on, if you are using them, and salt and pepper, though go easily on these because the finished product will be so flavorful youll need very little to help it along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bake the tomatoes in the oven for about three hours. You want the tomatoes to be shriveled and dry, but with a little juice left insidethis could take more or less time depending on the size of your tomatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either use them right away or let them cool, cover them with some extra olive oil and keep them in the fridge for the best summer condiment, ever. And for snacking.

       Or you can put them in your wonderful recipe for Pearl Couscous with Olives and Roasted Tomatoes.  I made it again this past weekend (second time in as many weeks) to bring to a picnic where it was such a big hit that someone practically licked the bowl clean.
       <br/>
       I cant get over how even tasteless grape tomatoes can be transformed into something this good!

       You know, the most amazing thing about living in where Im moving to (YAY) is its proximity to so many lovely things, like the Union Square market for example. And to show my mom just what a wonder this market is, well go over there early on Saturday morning (unpacking  whats that?) and purchase the loveliest tomatoes we can find and slow roast them to give the apartment that homey, live-in smell. I cant think of anything better to celebrate my new home!

       Ive been reading about these tomatoes for a year now, and its probably about time I tried them for myself.  My only concern is that Ive already been buying what feels like large quantities of tomatoes on the weekends and finishing them within a day or two I might have to make a special tomato-only greenmarket trip to make sure I buy enough to roast and also to satisfy my constant raw-tomato cravings! :)

       ugh.  Way to rub salt in my wounds.  I was halfway through making these today, AFTER which I was going to make that beautiful cake you posted the other day (in cupcake form) and my oven up and died.  Seriouslyeverytime I cook something, you post a recipe for it hours later.  Do you have cameras in my house?

       Can we also use this method with slices of bigger, not-mutant tomatoes? Im thinking of the lovely garden tomatoes that will soon be hawked on every roadside here in WV.  And I know that my mother in law will give me more than I can use before they go bad/make into sauce.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, how long do they stay good in the fridge under oil?

       I cant wait to do this  and Im glad you included garlic!  I love taking those cloves, popping out the roasted goodness, and spreading it on bread.  Better than butter.  I cant believe I just said that.

       You can also leave them spread out on the baking sheet and stick them in the freezer for an hour (so that they dont clump together) before sticking them in ziploc bags and freezing them for the long term.  I do this every summer so that I can have some tomato-y goodness in the wintertime.

       Between me and my mom. we are nearly overrun with grape and cherry tomatoes this time of year. This is a fab solution!

       And Im with you when it comes to tomato on bagels with cream cheese. I toss on some thinly sliced (like see-through) onion before the salt and pepper. Heaven.

       I forgot to add that you can peel the cloves of garlic when youre donetheyll be wonderful and sweetand store them in the container with the tomatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theyll keep in the fridge under oil for a couple weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use large tomatoes, but Id still encourage you to just halve them. You want the juices to all roast together inside a cup-like shape of skin. If they can run out the bottom, they wont get as nicely muddled together.

       If you grow cherry or grape tomatoes, you can also (or instead) grow currant-sized varieties, like Spoon.  Like cherry, currant are insanely productive, but you can hold a bunch of them in a spoon (hence the variety name).  I mention them because they are
       <i>
        fantastic
       </i>
       when dried, just crazy amounts of flavor, and dont take as long to dry.

       Fellow tomato lover! I cant even eat store bought tomatoes, and when I do get my hands on some delicious garden grown ones I cant bear to do anything with them except gobble them up raw, with a bit of salt. Someday hopefully I will be over run with them and I will follow your lead.

       Oven-dried tomatoes are so delicious.  We used to make them at work all the time for use in a salad dressing and the smell was so divine.  My number one way to eat tomatoes is fresh, sprinkled with a little bit of salt and pepper.

       MMM, I think a solar oven would be perfect for this task.  Wouldnt heat up the house in the middle of the summer.  Ive been trying to get DH to build one for me.  I usually just grill my tomatoes and them use them.  I have actually dried tomatoes in the sun a couple years ago, they were delicious! You just have to do it under screen so bugs dont get in.

       ung (no. 12), keeping the skins on the garlic allows the garlic to roast/steamby keeping the moisture inside the gralic it stays tender and has no bitter taste which can happen when roasted unpeeled.

       even though I agree with the wonders of fresh tomatoes with a dash of salt, this is the best way (imo) to put up tomoatoes for the winter, and have that summer-wonderful taste in the dead of winter. Deb knows of what she speaksthere are nothing like the bottled sun-dried tomatoesthese are the essence of summer, just concentrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill usually wait til late September, here in NYC, when toms are cheap and plentiful, and it feels nice to have the oven onI put mine through a food mill and then pack into an ice cube tray, freeze, and then bag. I defrost and use in all the ways that Deb mentions. But Deb, these look AMAZING. Gorgeous photos.

       Oookayso those freakishly perfect grocery store grape tomatoes I just purchased are now going into the oven instead of on top of the salads that I was planning to make to go with the *double* batch of your buttermilk dressing that I just made!

       When the July 15 2nd-planting date (Austin) came around wed already had over 20 100+ degree days. Now were past 40 days over 100. Sad times for anything, including tomatoes, that have to live outside.

       Great method. Im definitely freaked out by the little supermarket tomatoes, so this eases the creepy factor. And I put mine on puff pastry squares with fontina cheese and pesto. But Ill have to try the in my mouth idea next time.

       Delish. Ive heard your own oven-dried tomatoes are heavenly, and Im willing to give it a try.

       The bagel with tomato is my favorite breakfast! Sometimes I go crazy and use goat cheese.

       At the end of last summer, I babbled on and on to anyone who would listen about the wonderful slow roasted tomatoes I made following directions from Kalyns Kitchen, and links from her site. Only those were roasted for 12 hours! I tossed small, halved homegrown plum tomatoes with olive oil and a few dried herbs, then slow roasted for 8-12 hours at 200-250 until a bit shriveled, but still succulent. The skins easily slipped off, leaving nothing but a juicy burst of the essence of tomato. Perfect to top a slice of slightly toasted sourdough smeared with goat cheese and maybe a spot of pesto  in fact thats exactly what my 16 year old son requested for his birthday dinner in January (they froze fairly well, but not as good as freshly made). Here in western New York were still waiting for tomatoes to ripen, and Im so ready for them.

       You know, there are worse vices out there.  Thank God yours is a bunch of tomatoes!  I will definitely have to try this.  Im not a fan of jarred sun-dried tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe/method.

       I made these a week ago! from a bucket of ?big cherry tomatoes (or small real ones  golf-ball sized) i bought at the farmers market. They were so amazing I ate about a quarter of them before I got them into the oil and the fridge and wasnt even ashamed. Chop up and toss with pastatoss into simmered fresh shell beans eat with fingers in front of open refrigerator when no one is looking oh yeah.

       Oven roasted tomatoes make the best sauce in the world.  Pizza, pasta, lasagna, anything made with it will taste so good you will be amazed.  So worth the effort and time and money for locally grown vine ripened tomatoes.

       Ive never made sundried tomatoes but I cant seem to leave the farmers market without pounds of tomatoes.  Then I get home and wonder how Im going to eat all of those before they go bad.  This sounds like a great way to use the ones that dont make their way into a BLT.

       These look great.  When I was working at a restaurant a while back we made something similar by leaving them in the big professional ovens overnightthe pilot light was enough heat to dry them out perfectly by morning.

       Dang, girl, you really know how to get to me!  Forced me to make a tomato sandwich for breakfast, and all I had on hand were two little Campari tomatoes left over from a series of salads!  Usually when finishing off a tomato sandwich I have to go back and make a second, but that will entail a trip to the grocery store in the pouring rain.  OK, Im crazy.  Off I go.  Hope they have a lot!

       Out of the ball park once again! I dont know about anyone else, but I have a list of outrageous recipes from your site that Im salivating to try. When this first appeared in Gourmet the suggested time was close to six hours. I couldnt squeeze out a six hour block of time that my wife was scheduled to be out of the house. There was no way that I could attempt to either justify nor explain why I was running the oven for that length of time, and still save my marriage. As it is, Im under a restraining order not to buy and/or bring into the kitchen one more appliance or cooking tool. This is why this is soooooo great!  I can now attempt this recipe with existing cookware  if I can manage the new abbreviated and more realistic cooking time ! Thanx  you have saved my marriage &amp; allowed me my OCD cooking urge !

       I am so glad Im not the only person who thinks packaged sun-dried tomatoes are grody. These sound much more wonderful, and worth giving a try. Thanks for the recipe!

       I just pulled those tomatoes out of the oven..well, maybe 15 minutes ago.  Ive been launching them, one after another, for the rest of the time.  Deb..these are SO good.  The flavors are so sweet and concentrated..almost jammy and chewy and slightly crisp all at the same time. I can think of a bunch of things I can use them in or for.   I hope I will have enough left to toss in with some pasta..or those white beans you mentioned today.    Shucks!  Ill just get more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only had a handful of garden cherry types left, so I bought a small pkg of the hot house baby romas and added those..just to see how it improves them.  Well, they arent quite as sweet as the garden variety..but they will certainly will do even if you arent in a pinch.

       I love summer tomatoes!  Although my favorite thing to do is marinate them in some cider vinegar with chopped fresh basil (dissolve liberal amount of sugar in it to cut the pucker) for about 15-20 mins,  top the slices with a whole basil leaf and a thick slice of fresh mozerella.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then consume.  But you knew that part.

       MMM These look amazing. What a great way to use up some of the tomatoes that have gone past their peak. At least, I would slow roast them.

       Thank you!  I now have a plan for dealing with the abundance of tomatoes in my fridge (for some reason, I continue to buy new packs for salads when I already have some and then my co-worker shared some of her home-grown tomatoes with me as well its tomato chaos in my fridge, but not for long).

       I bought some beautiful cherry tomatoes at a farm stand yesterday and last night I swear I was dreaming about roasting tomatoes (something I have never done, only dreamed about). Only to be catching up in my blog reader this morning and come across this post. I think I have no choice but to make it tonight

       Ive done these with a little salt and sugar as recommended by Madhur Jaffrey in
       <i>

       </i>
        soooooo good.  When its hot or I only have a few tomatoes, I use the toaster oven.   I just made a huge batch to throw in pesto pasta for our Harvest Festival, and poured off and saved the oil to use in a salad dressing  it was great!

       I bought tomatoes today to make these!  Im so excited.  I love some dried oregano (and salt, vinegar, and olive oil) on fresh tomatoes, so I think Ill sprinkle them with oregano to roast them.  I love tomatoes!

       I love roasted tomatoes and its certainly the perfect time to make them. They are the perfect side dish. I wish I had a small garden here, they turn out so much better home grown.

       I tried this a few weeks ago during the salmonella tomato scarehad to use up those roma tomatoes I had bought at the grocery store.  They were so great with just a sprinkling of sea salt and drizzle of olive oil.  We ate them plain and added them to a pan bagnat (that we couldnt wait for it to be pressed for the full amount of time).   I hadnt thought of roasting garlic with them, but those roasted garlic cloves are great too.  Now I have tomatoes from the garden, but never enough to raost (we keep eating them fresh).  Ive never cared for sun-dried tomatoes, but these slow-roasted ones are terrific!

       I feel exactly the way you do about tomatoes.  I am now picking tomatoes daily off of my twenty heirloom tomato plants and its still not enough for me.  Its so unfair that we only get about one month a year for tomatoes.  I just made an insalata caprese for lunch, margherita pizzas on the grill last night and each day I make the fresh tomato base for tomato risotto that I freeze and use on cold winter days to remind me of summer.  Have been posting tomato recipes almost every day on my website.  Take a look!

       I went outside, digging to the bottom of my roma and cherry tomato plants  a goldmine of RED, ripe, juicy tomatoes. A quick rinse, sliced them, placed on baking sheet, sprinkled with Herbes de Provence and a few light splashes of oilive oiland by the time 2 l/2 hours had passed, was eating them out of the oven. Who can wait??  Heavenly! Perfection! Sweet and the garlic, pressed onto fresh french bread..sigh!  Thank you for sharing your love of tomatoes and this wonderful and easy recipe.

       You are absolutely right.  I figured I would turn all of the so-so mini tomatoes from our garden into some little veggie snacks to enjoy all week and roasted them this afternoon.  Then ate them all.  One by one.  Till they were gone. Yikes (but they are zero ww points as I only briefly spritzed them with evoo spray!).  Thanks for the idea!!

       Wow!  I made these yesterday and they are like little candies.  Honestly it would never have occurred to me to prepare tomatoes in this way and now I must always have some on hand.  They are crazy delicious.  My kitchen is HOT right now so I only left the oven on for 2 hours, then turned it off and kept the door closed for the final hour.  They taste so great.  Thanks for the post!

       So the CSA gave me 5 pints of cherry tomatoes and I decided to try this with pint #3 today. 3 hours later, I pull them out and taste. HmmmI thinknice but not the amazing thing she described. But still a good nosh. Let me try another. And another. And less than an hour later exactly 11 halves remained on the cookie sheet. They were amazingly addictive and an excellent use of the farm fresh cherry tomatoes. Thanks.

       Oh my goodness. I LOVE these. I eat them on everything I can think of and sometimes by themselves. I told my friend about them last year and she quickly whipped up a batch to put on her meatloaf while I turned them into a mediteranean style dip with green olives. MMmmmMMMMmmm

       I am going to make a large batch this weekend to eat on next week. In the meantime, I slice my grape tomatoes, sprinkle with balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper and fresh basil. I let them sit about 20 minutes then I dive in. I snack on them every night with my wine. Mmm

       I made these yesterday with some great cherry tomatoes.  I loved them!  I do wish I had sprinkled a little more salt on them before roasting, because they tasted just a teensy bit flat.  Next time.

       Im using this as a method of preserving some of my insanely large tomato harvest for winter (since a similar recipe in Deborah Madisons Local Flavors claims they freeze well). That is, if I can resist eating them all now.

       I made these last night with the plethora of plum tomatoes from my garden.  I roasted them for 8 hours because at 3, they were still pretty juicy and I wanted to see what happened if I left them in longer.  Phenomenal!  Not to mention how good the house smelled with the roasting garlic as well as the tomatoes.  Had them for breakfast this morning mixed with cottage cheese.  Still have lots of tomatoes so will be making these as often as I can until theyre gone.  Hope they freeze well!

       OMG or should I say OM Freaking G!  These were unbelievable.  Went to the farmers market and got a huge batch of grape tomatos. Roasted them as you directed and didnt even use herbs because I didnt have any on hand (fresh that it).  I couldnt stop eatiing them right as they came out of the oven.  LIKE CANDY!  These could become a serious addiction.  Thanks, once again for a sure fire hit.

       I did this night before last with a bunch of tomatoes that I knew I just wouldnt be able to eat before they turned on me.  Wow.  Chopped a few up and mixed them up with CANNED white beans, garlic, rosemary, &amp; olive oil last night and served it on crostini to some neighbors who came over for dinner.  No one could get enough.  Heavenly.  Thanks as always for the wonderful suggestionnever would have thought of it but I am savoring the results!

       These are a favourite of mine. One of my favourite ways to use them is to toss them, along with goat cheese, a little more olive oil and freshly snipped basil, with penne. Yummers. :-)

       Made these last night because my mothers garden runneth over put my patience for canning tomatoes for the third Sunday in a row does not.  Tiny grape tomatoes  or rather, tiny tomatoes, but giant for grapes  cut in half and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil baked slow for hours and eaten ravenously as a bright acidic burst next to the ham and scalloped potatoes the boyfriend requested last night
      </p>
      <p>
       they may have made me FEEL a lot less bad about eating nothing but potatoes, ham, cheese and cream for dinner last night, but i dont think they actually did anything to remove the aftermath from my waistline.

       With currant tomatoes, still cut them in half? I would love to make tomato raisins, but if cutting is optimal, then I am all go.

       These are in the oven as I type so expecting a beautiful tasty treat that will hopefully last through the winter.  I have a large freezer so Im going to try and freeze these guys afterwards.  Has anyone had any success with this yet?  Pictures were beautiful BTW!!!

       Great ideas, I have mine in the over as I am setting here on my computer. Was looking for info on how to store the oven roasted tomatoes when I came to your blog site. Putting them on a cookie sheet and freezing them is a great idea. I have tons of Heirloom tomatoes in my garden. Out here in California weather has been warm in the day time 80-90 and 42 at night so my tomatoes are splitting and need to do some thing with them now. Thanks for the great idea. Can only can so many tomatoes!

       I have been eating these once a week since finding this post.  Yum.  My new favorite way to eat them involves a pizza of sorts.  Mini whole wheat pita bread, a paste made with roasted garlic and olive oil, spinach, goat cheese, basil and lots of these tomatoes.  Super yum.

       Oh My!  I had leftover grape tomatoes from our usual Superbowl appetizer spread.  We serve them raw with a bowl of vodka and a bowl of kosher salt.  The deal is the more toothpick pokes you put in the tomato, the more vodka soaks in when you dip.  Final dip is the salt and into the mouth.  Yummmmm!  Since they were leftover, I tried this recipe!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonderful!!  How can you stop eating them?  DH woke up and popped one, and I watched his hand go back about 10 times before I stopped him!!

       I am sure these are great in all of the mentioned dishes, but I couldnt stop popping them right into my mouth so I dont know if this batch will be for anything BUT snacking.  I started making the tomatoes and had to leave the house so I set the timer on the oven.  My only regret is not getting to check them and possibly leaving the ones in the middle in a little longer to get as crispy as the ones on the outer edges of the pan.  DELICIOUS and so simple.  :)

       Oh my goodness.  These are nothing short of phenomenal.  I used Roma tomatoes and a sprinkle of fresh thyme.  I set the timer but wished I had been around to check them.  I think the Romas probably need about 3 1/2 hours.  I did beef kebobs with veggies last night on the grill and had leftover squash and onions along with some herbed rice.  I am mixing those veggies and the tomatoes with that rice to go with grilled chicken tonight.  I had to get it ready to nuke as I was eating and savoring the tomatoes one at a time, soon there would not have been any to add.  Will do more tomorrow.

       you are an inspiration! I couldnt wait the full 3 hours, but my tomatoes were still absolutely scrumptious. and they were yellow, a novelty which for some reason I still cant quite get over.

       Deb, I am late to the comment game on this, but this simple recipe has absolutely saved my sanity.  We planted cherry tomatoes for the first time this year and we are living in a deluge of them!  We do two pans of these every day and put them in just about everything!  Thankyouthankyou  Ive got all the gardeners I know doing it too.  Now if you could just bust out a recipe that would use about 12 eggplant

       Deb, this recipe is amazing. We have a bumper crop of tomatoes and Ive been at a total loss at what to do with all (several dozen) of them. I love this because its simple, delicious and doesnt overheat my tiny apartment.
       <br/>
       Thanks for all your knowledge.

       A friend just dropped off an entire laundry basket full of fresh tomatoes from his garden.  Some will go on tonights pizza, some for bruschetta and your hacked caprese salad.  But there are so many and I knew I had seen a recipe for oven roasted tomatoes and, of course, it was you!  To the rescue again.  Thank you.

       You can peel them and store them/eat them with the tomatoes! Er, if youre into roasted garlic. (Just skip the cloves if youre not.)

       I just had these in a restaurant for the very first time.  It was a high-end, dimly-lit joint.  I honestly had no idea what Id popped into my mouth, but desperately wished Id held back and cut them up or that theyd put more than two on my salad plate.  I begged to know what they were, incorrectly assuming they were some kind of dried flower.  THIS is my project for tomorrow, and Ill be using tomatoes from my very own garden.  Thanks for the awesome tips!

       I made these with garden-grown cherry tomatoes (tommy tippy toes to be exact) a couple weeks ago, and froze em. Last night I thew some in with some fettucini alfredo. Yum, yum, yum! Next time though, I think Ill cut them up first. Thats some *intense* flavor right there. Very sun-dried-tomato-esque, but so much brighter. Thanks for the recipe! :)

       Thank you so much for this! I made a pasta last night and slow roasted cherry tomatoes for 2 hours. I am already crazy for tomatoes, so these were out of this world. And I dont know if its just me, but it seems that the color intensified as well. Tonight Im using some left over roma tomatoes as a side for the dinner Im making and slow roasting them for 8 hours at 200. I cant wait to see how they turn out.

       Did anybody mention:  Cute!  These cherry tomatoes are just so darn cute!   Better make several pints next time if Im thinking theyre going to last longer than a night.  FYI:  2 Cups to a Pint.  27 Calories to a cup of raw cherry tomatoes.  Whos counting the olive oil..its good for you. Nbody ever got fat by being a pig and eating a bunch of tomatoes anyway.  LOL!  P.S.  Used thyme sprigs in when I was roasting.  My APT. SMELLS AWESOME.  Lots of love going on here.  Thanx.  JT

       Question. Can you preserve these so they last longer? I would love to use this recipe, can them and give as gifts this Christmas. Didnt see where you could can them though.
      </p>

       So is that possible?

       Echo  I read above that you can pop the baking tray into the freezer then put the flash frozen tomatoes into a bag to keep thruout the winter.  I am going to try that this year as I have fallen in love with slowroasting tomatoes.  I have only used plum tomatoes  and I halve them lengthwise and scoop out the seeds leaving the core intact.  I drizzle with evoo, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, sugar and coarse salt and fresh ground pepper.  275 for 2 hours.  YUM!  With fresh mozz, on pizzas, on salads, with chicken, plain  I think once you try them you become a convert!

       I had a huge bounty of garden tomatoes in 2009 and a neighbor suggested I roast them and then freeze them.  I let them cool and then divided them up into freezer bags in serving sizes. We ate them in sauce and soup all winter long. Oh my goodness!The flavor was rich and tomatoey. Amazing!
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint: if you use larger slicing tomatoes cut them into 4s, plums into 2s. Roast with the skin on. It holds the pulp &amp; juice and you can easily remove it later. For bigger tomatoes, roast at a higher temp for about 2-3 hours.

       I have reread this recipe over and over during the past few months, even though I dont really like tomatoes.  Is this some kind of cybernetic brainwashing?!!  OKso needless to saythe tomatoes are now in the oven and I am waiting impatiently as I read each and every comment!  (You need a couple more hours worth of comments, btw)  If you convert me to liking tomatoesso help me

       Two summers ago I had buckets and buckets of cherry tomatoes from patio container garden in NC, had about 6 different kinds, all colors, and I slow roasted many of them.  Completely amazing in pasta, on sandwiches, or plain.  I cant wait to try mixing with cottage cheese, yum.  We just moved to Oregon and I dont have a garden but there are still $2 pints of heirloom cherrys  and now we have a deep freezer  cant wait to try freezing!

       Just discovered your site for the first time today while searching for roasted cherry tomatoes. Decided to make these and YUM! Youre right the best place for them to go is POP! Right into my mouth. But I also decided to toast up a half an english muffin, drizzle on some olive oil, spread one of the garlic cloves and sprinkle the whole thing with a few tomatoes and a pinch of salt and YUM! Perfect afternoon snack :-). Next thing to make- cheddar and apple scones!

       Just a reminder for all of you buying lots of store-bought tomatoes.tomatoes are one of the top 3 veggies having heavy pesticide residue.  So if you dont grow them yourself, try and buy organic.  Whats the top pesticide offender?strawberries!

       Dear Deb
       <br/>
       I made these beauties today exactly like you said, and they turned out exactly like in your photos. BUT, I gave them a good shake in jar after adding some more olive oil, and now they are floating in juices, and my heart has sunk much below :( were they supposed to remain intact? are they doomed? eagerly waiting for your reply?

       I feel the same affectionate anticipation towards tomatoes. I wait each summer for the real tomatoes to ripen in my garden, eat as many as often as I can, then mourn the end of the season. An elderly lady taught me a valuable trick on lengthening the tomato season. before the first frost (I live in South Dakota, so it is pretty early here) I cut the long stems from the tomato plants, leaving green tomatoes attached. I place them in a cardboard box and cover with newspaper. Then the box sits in my mud room (not heated, but indoors off the family room). As I peek in each week, there are red ones waiting for me!  This year I almost made it to Christmas enjoying fresh tomatoes!

       I tried the roastedthe tomatoes for the very first time this weekend.  So incredibly delicious and perfect for my new vegan life style.  I have my a batch in the oven now.

       Wow. Just wow. Made these to have tonight with toasted sourdough, mozerella slices, rocket and then some pesto drizzled over the top  but it will be a challenge resisting their siren song for long enough so that they make it to the plate!

       Thank you so much for your post and more importantly for the technique.  Our tomatoes are just beginning to roll in and I know Ill be using this method and the roasted tomatoes a million different ways this summer.

       I have a recent obsession with these and have been buying them from Trader Joes and used them last week with your homemade ricotta on slices from a seeded baguette.  I had a bunch of grape tomatoes left over from a baby shower vegetable tray and thought Id try and find a recipe to make them at home.  It was not a surprise to see that you had one.  I love your taste!

       I made these last week.  They were wonderful.  I did like one post said and poured extra olive oil over them and covered them and stored them in the fridge.  I took them out yesterday and ate some.  I accidentally left them on the counter.  They look good and smell good.  Do they have to be refridgerated to keep from spoiling or would they still be safe to eat.

       I was just making some roasted tomatoes using the medium sized tomatoes from my garden and came across this recipe as I was trying to find out what to do with the abundance of cherry tomatoes I have.  Im going to give this recipe a try too, because I LOVE the ones I make every year.  Last year I decided to freeze them after I roasted them and I pull out a couple at a time and chop them to add to my bread dipping olive oil.  They are also great on top of sliced, toasted baguettes with a little herbed cheese like Boursin. Delicious!

       Oops!  Meant to mention that I put very thinly sliced garlic, a sprinkle of dried thyme, salt and sugar, along with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar when I roast them (in addition to the olive oil).  The larger tomatoes (cut in half across their equator and placed cut side up) roast at 300 degrees for 3-4 hours.  Im a chocoholic and would rather eat these than chocolate any day.  Im drooling waiting for them to come out of the oven!!!!

       Roasted tomatoes with peas over whole wheat penne is awesome!  A restaurant here sells a bowl of it for 9.95 and I use to eat multiple times a week while expecting both our kids.   Now I know the secret is roasted tomatoes and my children request it year round! Great post, beautiful pictures. Keep up the good work!

       this is the third year Ive used your recipe  lengthening the oven time as needed  to roast the heirloom tomatoes I grow; especially the Japanese Black Trifele, and Chocolate Cherry. They freeze well, and in the winter I like to stick blender a handful with a package of cream cheese to make an awesome veggie dip that gets rave reviews.

       Ive been doing cherry and grape tomatoes like this for years as I always had a garden in the back yard.  Now living in an apartment, I didnt think Id be doing the pickling, canning, and roasting I did before, but my son requested Oven Sundried Tomatoes so here I am waiting for the second last tray to come out of the oven. I do want to add that I have always sprinkled a teensy bit of sugar over the tomatoes along with the other ingredients as it cuts the acidity and if any of the tomatoes are a little unripe, this sweetens them up just a tad. My son pops them in his mouth like candies before I can even get them into freezer bags. (They last longer in the freezer, than in the oil).

       I had way too many cherry tomatoes that ripened at the same time so I did a google search for cherry tomato recipes.  Found this recipe today and immediately slow roasted all of my cherry tomatoes.  I also added a little sugar because my tomatoes were very acidic.  Put them on homemade pizza and my husband said it was the best pizza Id ever made.  Thanks so much!  Were vegetarian so I checked out some of your other recipes and signed up for your newsletter.  Looking forward to making more of your recipes.  Thanks!!!!

       Hi:
      </p>
      <p>
       I was given a 4 qt. basket of cherry tomatoes and your recipe immediately came to mind.  They are now in the oven.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, theyve been in the oven for 4 1/2 hours! and theyre still quite juicy!
       <br/>
       I just had my oven calibrated, so Im pretty sure its the correct temp. and for the last hour, theyve been at 300 degrees
      </p>
      <p>
       HELP, Any tips?

       The emergency is over.  I raised the oven a bit, and suddenly they were done.  I used oregano (my favorite) and thyme.  They are fabulous!  If I hadnt frozen  them, they would be gone.  Now I have to beg for more from my neighbour!

       Where have you been my whole life?  I am just now finding your blog and feel a connection to your recipes, your food and your attitude.  I am a mother of 3 living and breathing in Vermont with a garden that is virtualy taking over every free minute I have right now as I try to eat, process and salvage its nourishing harvest!  Tomatoes exploding from my ears, zuccinni that I am hoping to shred and freeze I even grew black beans this year.  I am new at this and loving every minute of it, but totally overwhelmed!  Thank you for the Roasted Tomato Soup with broiled cheddar recipe  cant wait to try it (MY FAVS) and the pearl couscous with olives an roasted tomatoes.  I will try this one on out of town guests this week-end! Denise

       SoI like planting different tomatoes. This year I have pear shaped yellow ones. An over abundance of them!! I used some to make fresh tomato sauce last week, but I still have a huge amount. Trying to figureout what to do with them. I cane across your recipe for the oven roasted ones. It was your pictures that sold me. So I have 2 large pans of them in the oven as I type. UGHHH but theyve only been in there for an hour! My daughtes boyfriend whos not a tomato lover said hed even try 1!.  I also know what do with the left over tomatoes in the garden,some ar ripe and some are not. I love that I can freeze these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive never ever had a roasted tomato in my 53 yrs of life. But I grew up on a dairy farm in CT, so Im used to fresh veggies or fresh frozen veggies my whole life. There will never ever be a store bought canned veggie entering my mouth ever, same goes for both of my daughters.
      </p>
      <p>
       At my old age, Im finally venturing into uncharted waters with preparring veggies different ways. Yes I know it took me enough years..LOL. But Im loving every minute of it.Thank you for this recipe and now to check the tomatoes, and off to see the rest of your recipes. Esepcially the Roasted Tomato Soup with broied cheese.

       I was just doing a search for delicious cherry tomato recipes because the tomato gods have seen fit to grant me with a MONSTROUS amount of these gem-like, gorgeous bright orange cherry tomatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I have no problem with this as I love them (as does everyone else here) but Im getting a little frantic as they are overflowing the house, yard, etc!
      </p>
      <p>
       I picked two large bowls full of cherries and romas and its in the oven now.  Im so excited!  I know they are going to be fantastic!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks so much for such a lovely recipe!  I know Ill use it every year, now! :)

       Great article!  Is it okay to add Basil to this recipe?  With or without the Rosemary &amp; Thyme?  (Im thinking of using all 3.)
       <br/>
       Also, is it okay to not use the salt &amp; pepper?  I prefer to leave them out of all my cooking and allow the diners to add their own.
       <br/>
       Thank you so much for this recipe.  I cant wait to try it.

       Thanks SO much for this article! This has been my go-to recipe all tomato season. As a matter of fact, sliced heirlooms are roasting in the oven as I type (hoarded some from the last crop of this season). Delicious and so easy!
      </p>

       Lyn  I sprinkled herbes de provence and very lightly salted the current batch.  The salt helps draw out the tomato juices.  Didnt use pepper.

       Are you supposed to take the skins off after cooked?   That seems hard as a lot of the tomato pulp stays in the skin.  What is the best way to do this?

       I know its the middle of winter, but I got a good deal on some organic cherry tomatoes from Trader Joes and was looking for something to do with them. I dried about half of them using this method, and they came out great! I didnt have any whole garlic on hand, so I drizzled them with a combination of EVOO and some of the oil my minced garlic is packed in, then seasoned with basil and a little bit of salt. They dried up beautifully in about an hour and a halfmy old gas oven only goes down to 250, and it was actually hovering around 275 the whole time so they cooked quickly. Plus, they were little guys, more like grape tomatoes. Very deliciousjust make sure you keep an eye on them. Thanks for the recipe!

       I am so excited to find this recipe.  Aldis had pints of tomatoes for 69 this week and I just couldnt stop buying them.  My daughter thinks she can eat them just like grapesa pint at a time.  I am suprised they dont hurt her stomach. Hope she likes these too.

       OK, just popped a mix of grape &amp; sun gold tomatoes in the oven with the garlic, thyme, rosemary &amp; a smidgin of sea salt &amp; pepper. Its only been 5 minutes &amp; already smells so good I may go beserk before these are ready. Hope I can restrain myself.

       THESE ARE THE BEST! I had seen a few other versions, but they always involved peeling and seeding the tomatoes first, which was just way too much work. Then I found this, so simple and the results are unbelievable! I did it without the garlic and the tomatoes were just regular grocery store tomatoes, not even in season. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

       After harvesting more tomatoes than we can eat (even giving some to the restaurant I work at for a featured dinner special) canning many pints of tomato sauce, salsa and crushed tomatoes, this recipe is an absolute life saver! I had heard about a low-energy drying method of spreading halved tomatoes on a baking sheet and leaving them in a closed up car sitting in the hot NC sun all day, but this method seems a bit more sound and safe. Thank you!

The slow roasting really brought out a sweetness I never tasted before. So glad I found your blog.  I read cook books like theyre romance novels and your blog reads like that for me.  Looking forward to the juicy parts.  Youll be hearing from me again

       OMG  These are the best ever  I have roasted tomatoes for years  but at a higher heat  this slow roast method brings out a wonderful flavor  and the tomatoes hold their body when roasted slow.  Going to try freezing them  great idea~

       Every time my tomatoes are ripened, I make a cookie sheet full of roasted tomatoes for sauces. A few weeks ago, I used herbs for making pasta sauce. Today, I am roasting a tray for pizza sauce. I freeze all sauces in the freezer for winter meals. They freeze really well. I did this last year and had sauces all winter long for over pasta, rice, and pizzas. All of the herbs I use are grown by me. I grow them in large containers indoors in the winter, as well. Who says its expensive to eat?

       I use a blender to puree mine. Another idea for the pasta saucewhen you take it from the freezer and thawadd cream and vodka. NOW, thats a sauce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza toasties: Regular white, wheat, or any sliced bread. Lay out on cookie sheet. Add sauce. Top with mozzarella cheese. Broil. Meal that takes less than five minutes to make. Serve with salad. Quick and inexpensive!

       I just made this recipe with the last of my cherry tomatoe crop, before removing the plants from my garden for the winter.  They were absolutely the best.  Used the rosemary and thyme from the garden too.  Had them on top of toasted bagel with garlic herb cream cheese.

       This recipe was just what I needed to use up the grape tomato surplus from my garden.  They came out perfect and delicious!  I had one pan of red grape tomatoes and one of the yellow.  The yellow were so sweet! Even better than the red ones.  And the garlicyummy! Thanks everybody for all the comments and hints on this recipe.

       I love these and this is what I do with most of my garden cherries.  I then take that pan and put it directly into the chest freezer, once frozen I package them up, removing air, into snack size ziplocs and use them throughout winter in OH  every recipe I make just about!  Love them in good old tomato pasta sauce, but a wonderful addition to all chicken crockpot recipes, salads, pizzas, etc. etc. etc.  Dont let them go bad, freeze and use for months!

       Deb, I had NEVER done this before yesterday and now Ive just completed my second cookie sheet full of beautiful red, yellow and orange cherry tomatoes and romas.  I am in love with this flavor!  I am babysitting a friends garden while shes in the UK and this will help me keep from letting any of her beautiful bounty go to waste!

       This was so, so, good and incredibly easy. I followed the recipe exactly with grape tomatoes and they were perfect in bruschetta.

       OMG  Happened upon this website yesterday because I have (had) an abundance of cherry tomatoes.  Made my first batch yesterday and my daughter and I devoured them while standing at the stove talking.  Made another pan today and it is half gone already without any help.  Thank you!  Thank you!  This method is a keeper :)

       I have a question about storage.  I made this recipe (sooo delicious!), put them in a jar with some olive oil and put in the fridge.  Awesome.  But now the oil solidified and its not pretty at all!  Can these be left out of the fridge if theyre packed in oil?  Thanks!

       Hi Amy  It will last longer in the fridge; I dont think it would be safe at room temperature. Dont be bothered by the solidified oil; some olive oils do that in the fridge. It should re-liquefy and resume being clear after you take it out of the fridge for a while.

       I love the slow roasting idea and will try this recipe next; however, you dont answer an important question. Why do you not take the skin off the garlic? Is it a burning issue?  I am a garlic freak  and would like to put loads of garlic cloves in, unpeeled.  Also, how is the best way to freeze these tomatoes when you have a large quantity and cant use them all at once?

       Joan  I didnt take the skins off because I wanted them to slowly caramelize, as you would a halved head of garlic. You can pop them out after and eat them however youd like. I havent tried to freeze these but it looks like a few people have commented on it, see #98, 137, 141, 158, etc.

       Deb, this is my second year of using your recipe for roasting tomatoes.  Round 2 in the oven now.  Last year, I froze in zip lock bags and took them to Arizona and was able to get through the winter and have some left here at home as sauce in the freezer when I got home in May.   This and your uncluttered chicken stock are my go to recipes for on hand staples!  Thank you! :)

       This is year #4 of using this recipe. I look forward to my home grown cherry tomatoes for this use alone. I have to fight off a hungry boyfriend and greedy chickens, but I managed to get a big batch into the oven. I peel the garlic after its cooled and store it with the tomatoesthe garlic gets so sweet and yummy that the cloves go fast too. Thank you so much for this recipe!! I dont look at a bumper crop of tomatoes as a bother anymore, just more tomatoes for the oven!

       Ive been making these since the recipe was first posted.  I sprinkle oregano and basil on top.  I just made two trays todayleft them on the counter in a bowl and theyre just about gone.  Everyone who passed through the kitchen had to stop and eat some.  My favorite is to mash the garlic with cream cheese, spreading it on crusty bread or crackers and top with the roasted tomatoes.  Heavenly!!

       We have had our organic veggie (No-dig, Ruth Stout method) garden for a few years and always let the previous years garden remains stay in the garden for DIY composting.  For the first time probably 100 volunteer tomato plants sprouted in May  and we let most of them go for it without thinning.  They went crazy and are still producing in late October!  Your slow roast then eat or freeze technique has allowed us to preserve so many with a delicious result.  THANK YOU!!

       Hi Deb! These look wonderful and I totally want to try them!
       <br/>
       May I ask, how long can I leave these in the fridge after making them? (Providing they last that long.. but I want to make a massive batch of these!)

       Adriana  If you submerge them in oil, Id say a week or two. Other people have mentioned that they freeze very well, if youd like them for longer.

       Last year I made these and froze them.  They didnt last NEARLY long enough, but what I wanted to mention was that I saved the delicious tomato/thyme/salt/garlic/oil pan drippings.  I put tomatoes on the top of the chicken, held them on with a piece of chicken, and basted with the oil.  Wow.  Just wow.

       I made these yesterday, was going to put them on the pizza I was making, but, they never made it that far. I ate all of them, but before you think Im crazy, I made a small batch! I like to add extra oil before roasting, because it is so useful, in many ways. So yummy!
