     Historic Clifton Mill is one of the largest
            water powered grist mills still in existence. The first mill 
at this site was built in 1802 by Owen Davis, a Revolutionary War soldier and 
frontiersman miller. The mill was built in this location
            to take advantage of the natural power of the concentrated water funneled into the gorge. 
Owen Davis and his son-in-law, General Benjamin Whiteman also built a saw mill 
and a distillery. Soon a village known as Davis Mills sprang up around the mills. 
The Little Miami River powered five other mills that
            were built within a mile of Clifton Mill; a woolen mill, saw mill,
            paper mill, barrel mill and another grist mill. Clifton Mill is the only one still standing.

     Around 1810 Davis sold his grist mill to Robert Patterson, 
father of the founders of NCR. Patterson renamed the village Cliff Town, 
had it surveyed into lots and officially made a town whose name was shortened to 
Clifton. Clifton grew rapidly and at one point had a population three
            times that of today with blacksmith shops, a butcher shop, two 
churches, a school, a hotel, two grocers, weavers, shoemakers, paper makers and 
more. Due to Robert Patterson being made Quartermaster, Clifton played a part in 
the War of 1812. Clifton Mill provided corn meal for
            federal troops from this part of Ohio, while Patterson's woolen mill provided cloth 
and buttons for uniforms.

     Robert Patterson 
sold Clifton Mill to the Armstrong family who ran the mill for more than 20 
years. Then three generations of the Preston family ran the mill till 
1948. Many years and several owners later, the Satariano family purchased 
the mill to preserve such an historic and beautiful piece of property.

     Come visit the mill
            in person. It will be an enjoyable and educational experience you will long remember. 
During Spring and Summer you can tour the inner workings of the mill to see first hand one of Americas earliest 
industries. At one time there were approximately 100,000 mills in this 
country.Now there are less than 100 still in their original operating 
condition. On display inside Clifton Mill is a collection of over 300 flour bags from mills 
around the country. Many of these bags are over 100 years old and are 
beautiful, colorful examples of some of America's 
first advertising practices.
