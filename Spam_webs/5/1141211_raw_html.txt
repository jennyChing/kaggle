    The Germans landed on the Moon as early as probably 1942,
utilizing their larger exoatmospheric rocket saucers of the
Miethe and Schriever type.  The Miethe rocket craft was built in
diameters if 15 and 50 meters, and the Schriever Walter turbine
powered craft was designed as an interplanetary exploration
vehicle.  It had a diameter of 60 meters, had 10 stories of crew
compartments, and stood 45 meters high.  Welcome to Alice in
Saucerland.  In my extensive research of dissident American
theories about the physical conditions on the Moon I have proved
beyond the shadow of a doubt that there is atmosphere, water and
vegetation on the Moon, and that man does not need a space suit
to walk on the Moon.  A pair of jeans, a pullover and sneakers
are just about enough.  Everything NASA has told the world about
the Mood is a lie and it was done to keep the exclusivity of the
club from joinings by the third world countries.  All these
physical conditions make it a lot more easier to build a Moon
base.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ever since their first day of landing on the Moon, the
Germans started boring -and tunneling under the surface, and by
the end of the war there was a small Nazi research base on the
Moon.  The free energy tachyon drive craft of the Haunibu-1 and
2 type were used after 1944 to haul people," materiel and the
first robots to the construction site on the Moon.  When
Russians and Americans secretly landed jointly on the Moon in
the early fifties with their own saucers, they spent their first
night there as guests of the .... Nazi underground base.  In the
sixties a massive Russian - American base had been built on the
Moon, that now has a population of 40,000 people, as the rumor
goes. After the end of the war in May 1945, the Germans continued
their space effort from their south polar colony of Neu Schwabenland.
I have discovered a photograph of their underground space control
center there.

   <h3>
    GERMAN-JAPANESE MILITARY R&amp;D COOPERATION:
   </h3>
   According to Renato Vesco again, Germany was sharing a
great deal of the advances in weaponry with their allies the
Italians during the war.  At the Fiat experimental facility at
lake La Garda, a facility that fittingly bore the name of air
martial Hermann Goering, the Italians were experimenting with
numerous advanced weapons, rockets and airplanes, created in
Germany.  In a similar fashion, the Germans kept a close contact
with the Japanese military establishment and were supplying it
with many advanced weapons.  I have discovered for example a
photo of a copy of the manned version of the V-1 - the
Reichenberg - produced in Japan by Mitsubishi.  The best fighter
in the world - the push-pull twin propeller Domier-335 was
duplicated at the Kawashima works.  Or a photo of Japanese high
ranking Imperial navy officers inspecting the latest German
radar station.
   <p>
    A Japanese friend of mine in Los Angeles related to me
the story of his friend's father, who worked as technician in an
aircraft research bureau in Japan during the war.  In July of
1945, two and a half months after the war ended in Germany, a
huge German transport submarine  brought to Japan the latest of
German inventions - two spherical wingless flying devices.  The
Japanese R&amp;D team put the machines together, following the
German instructions, and... there was something very bizarre and
other-earthy  standing in front of them - a ball shaped flying
device without wings or propellers, that nobody knew how it
flied.  The fuel was added, the start button of this unmanned
machine was pressed* and it .... disappeared with a roar and
flames without a in the sky.  The team never saw it again.  The
engineers were so frightened by the unexpected might of the
machine, that they promptly dynamited the second prototype and
choose to forget the whole incident.

   <h3>
    GERMAN-JAPANESE FLIGHT TO THE MOON AND MARS IN 1945-46:
   </h3>
   According to the authors of the underground German
documentary movie from the Thule society, the only produced
craft of the Haunibu-3 type - the 74 meter diameter naval
warfare dreadnought - was chosen for the most courageous mission
of this whole century - the trip to Mars.  The craft was of
saucer shape, had the bigger Andromeda tachyon drives, and was
armed with four triple gun turrets of large naval caliber (three
inverted upside down and attached to the underside of the craft,
and the fourth on top of the crew compartments).
   <p>
    A volunteer suicide crew of Germans and Japanese was
chosen, because everybody knew that this journey was a one-way
journey with no retum.  The large intensity of the
electro-magnetogravitic fields and the inferior quality of the
metal alloys used then for the structural elements of the drive,
was causing the metal to fatigue and get very brittle only after
a few months of work of the drive.  The flight to Mars departed
from Germany one month before the war ended - in April 1945.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was probably a large crew, numbering in the hundreds,
because of the low level of automation and electronic controls
inside the saucer.  Most of the systems of the craft had to be
operated like these on a U-boat of that time - manually. 
Because the structurally weakened tachyon drives were not
working with full power and not all the time, the trip to Mars
took almost 8 months to accomplish.  An initial short trust
towards Mars was probably used the strong gravitational field
close to Earth, after that the craft was "coasting" for 8 months
in an elliptical orbit to Mars with its main drives turned off. 
Later trips to Mars by the joint Soviet - American craft in 1952
and by the Vatican craft of the Marconi project from Argentina
in 1956 reached Mars in only 2 - 3 days, because their drives
were working during the whole flight: accelerating in the first
half and decelerating in the second.  Smaller Kohler converters
were probably used to power the systems and life support
equipment on board.  I do not have any information at the
present time about any artificial gravity capability on board
the craft, but that could have been easily done with the large
antigravity drives of the ship.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a heavy, almost crashing landing, the saucer slammed to a
stop, damaging irreparably its drives, but saving the crew. 
That happened in the middle of January 1946.  The crash landing
on Mars was not only due to the crippled tachyon drives of the
craft - it was also due to the smaller gravitational fleld of
Mars generating less power for the tachyon drives; and also due
to the thinner atmosphere on Mars, that could not be used as
effectively for air breaking as the Earth's atmosphere could. 
The craft was shaped as a giant saucer - a form that is very
efficient as an air brake,  when it is entered into the
atmosphere with its luge cross section perpendicular to the
trajectory of descent.
   </p>
   <p>
    One question, that I have not answered yet in the
affirmative is how were the Germans able to regenerate the air
inside the craft for 8 months for this big crew.  Quite probably
they were using advanced life support systems, developed
initially for their larger Walter turbine and free energy
submarines,  that were cruising the oceans without resurfacing.
   </p>
   <p>
    The radio message with the mixed news was received by the
German underground space control center in Neu Schwabenland and
by their research base on the Moon.
