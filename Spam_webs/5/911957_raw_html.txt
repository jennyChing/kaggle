             Auriculotherapy is also called auricular acupuncture. According to his followers, we can treat the various organs of the body by stimulating specific points on the pinna.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It is thus possible to apply these points using sterile needles that are asked, as appropriate, within seconds or minutes. Semi-permanent needles are also used, we will leave one to two weeks. It can also carry out stimulation or electromagnetic radiation painless.
             <br/>
             Chinese acupuncture in the experiment
             <br/>
             <br/>
             This practice, which can be used as a diagnostic tool and as a treatment, has emerged in the 50s. As we know, the Chinese have always been renowned for the methods of acupuncture. However, they did not so much from the field of auricular acupuncture. They touched the points of the ear to treat diseases of the eyes or throat, and some diseases that are accompanied by fever. Dr.  Paul Nogier who has studied homeopathy and spinal manipulation had the  idea of applying the methods of acupuncture in the ear area, noticing  his uncanny resemblance to a fetus in reverse. In  addition, traces of cauterization as healers practiced to relieve  sciatica and who were still visible on the ears of the people are more  encouraged to push its research. The advertising ban this practice in France was closed today because it is now treated with acupuncture. The World Health Organization admitted in 1987 the practice of auricular therapy.
             <br/>
             The points at issue
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Three  main points of interest to the external ear acupuncture ear: the  wonderful point and point plexus which lie both at the root of the  helix, the zero point which is at the top of the root of the helix. Wonderful spot stimulation can fight against the spasms and pain and resolve the problem of hypertension. The point plexus is also sought to curb the pain. As to zero, it is stimulated to regulate nerve impulses and to act against the pains and spasms. Areas  of the head are focused above the ear lobe, the abdominal viscera,  chest and genitals are in the middle part and the spine and lower limbs  are located on the helix.
             <br/>
             Health also requires ears
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Thus  Auriculotherapy is used to treat acute or chronic pain, addictions,  including tobacco and drugs, gastric disorders, insomnia and also  diseases caused by stress. However, the  use of this form of therapy is not recommended for very elderly, those  with severe heart disease or autoimmune diseases and for pregnant women.
             <br/>
             Polemics on Auriculotherapy
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It should be mentioned that Auriculotherapy has been subject to controversy. Scientific  studies have suggested that the practice is not as effective as it  claims to treat cancer pain or addiction to cocaine.

             Body  by filling a vital function separately undergo irreversible changes may  need to act for patient survival, substituting a healthy body. Thus, every 24 hours, lives are saved by organ transplantation. And for this transplant to take place, organ donation must be made beforehand.
             <br/>
             Organ donation and its laws
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Organ donation is above all a very generous act because not only is it free but a donation is also discreetly. In  addition, the levy is governed by the laws of public health, bioethics  laws that distinguish the extraction of an organ of a person alive and  one made on a person whose brain is dead, but the beat the heart is still maintained, the time of sampling. The  requirement of consent, free of the act, anonymity on the recipient or  the generous donor and the proscription of advertising are the  fundamental bioethical principles. In addition, the majority of donors is mandatory before accepting their donations.
             <br/>
             A life for a life
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Contact (e) by organ donation, you ask many questions about it. To  begin, know that your move is a major act for the sick and you know  already that will save lives, particularly when giving a heart or lung. As a result, most transplants are performed with samples from deceased individuals. For this, the extraction will only occur if the / the deceased (e) has agreed in his lifetime or at least there was no cons. On the other hand, it can be done without a death certificate duly established. And with regard to children under 18, parents must consent to the collection by keeping writing.
             <br/>
             A priceless gift
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Organ  donation can be made by living people and in this case the relevant  bodies may be a kidney, a lobe of the lung or the liver. Indeed, the human being has two kidneys and that is why he is able to give. Nevertheless,  and although the liver as the lungs are the organs whose list of  patients is usually the longest, extract a portion thereof of a living  human body is not a trivial operation and is also extremely difficult.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Moreover,  the donation made in his lifetime is usually done to prevent a person  close to death or to improve the daily life of a patient by reducing the  medical treatment he must undergo. In  this case, the donor must be explicitly with the recipient's family or  who at least have lived with the patient for two years minimum. Thus  each member of a family as father, sister, cousin, aunt or grandparent  can give a body like the kidney to relieve (e) a close relative (e) of  the painful moments dialysis, for example. And of course, like any transplant, the compatibility is required and the bigger it is, the more treatment will be easy.

             Pollution, filth and poor sanitation promote the appearance of lice. And when they got hold of the hair, how to get rid as fast that effectively?
             <br/>
             An insect "tying"
             <br/>
             <br/>
             These are small insects that feed solely on human blood and are transmitted only between men. They nest in your hair and reproduce at a staggering rate. The female lays about 300 eggs called nits, which attach to the hair thanks to a kind of very strong glue. They become lice after one week and lay to turn other nits.
             <br/>
             It itches behind the ears?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Lice cause the pediculosis, parasitic and infectious diseases. The  child has head lice infestation is scratching his head violently to the  point of producing skin lesions on the scalp, neck and temples. Given  the rapid reproduction and large numbers of these insects, we must  react as soon as we detected their presence in the hair.
             <br/>
             Products for erase
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Very often it is children who go to school lice. The first thing to do is to prevent school officials. It will also carry out the removal of lice in the hair. Various products are offered on the market. We have the choice between shampoos, lotions and sprays. Shampoos come in different forms: anti-lice shampoo foam, anti-lice shampoo and anti-slow. Must distribute the shampoo evenly through hair so well it wraps the lice and nits. The lotions are applied to dry hair. Sprays have the great disadvantage of not suitable for asthmatics. They are nevertheless effective to loosen the nits and to remove the dead nits that still cling to the hair. We must take the precaution of using aerosols in ventilated areas. Currently, products that suffocate the lice are sold. They are made from natural oils such as coconut oil. Spread all over your hair, they attack the lice asphyxiating.
             <br/>
             A fixture against lice
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Besides these products, you can also use combs. They are of two kinds: the lice comb and comb steel electronics. The first has teeth with smooth rounded tips that slide easily from the hair, whether long or curly. It removes the nits, dead or alive, and lice do not cause any pain. The electronic comb works with a battery of 1.5 volts. Is passed between the comb the hair to electrocute the lice that fall between his teeth. There is no risk, electronic discharge can affect your health. The comb has the characteristic of electronic zoom until it has found prey. It is suitable for all hair types. The great advantage of the combs is that they can be used without risk of allergy or asthma attacks. Whatever the method, we must know we must act against both lice and nits. This is the safest method to prevent further flare-ups.

             More  than a gym providing a real well-being, qi gong is not only a work on  the energy flows that are present in our body but also a way of life  while being an art.

Thus, all these different energies are one and benefits the whole body as the human spirit. Man evolves and actually belongs to a universe of energies gravitate. Thus, the exercises are still in the air to come into contact with them. The practice is based on a series of relaxed and natural movement while breathing deeply and regularly. Concentration  is essential to move the qi in the body, mind and body should be  relaxed for better coordination of movements in space. Qi  gong can be likened to an exercise that aims to strengthen the vital  functions of the body and tap into the energies that surround us the key  to longevity.

             You may wear them all day without knowing their history. This product has revolutionized our lives and our view. We speak of course of contact lenses. The ability to carry an extra lens to correct vision is just extraordinary. You may think that contact lenses are a fairly recent invention? After reading their story, you may learn that this is not the case.
             <br/>
             To learn more about the lenses, here's an article about their history and the different types that are available today.
             <br/>
             The history of contact lens
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As we have said, the contact lens is not a new invention. Indeed,  the universal genius Leonardo da Vinci, had the brilliant idea already  in 1508, trying to neutralize the refractive errors by placing a glass  lens in the eye. But it was not the only experiment with this idea. In 1637, the philosopher Rene Descartes tried to correct vision problems by placing a tube filled with water in the cornea. These inventions, as you can imagine, were not very comfortable and were never marketed.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             We had to wait until 1887 to see the arrival of lenses similar to those we wear today. However, they were still very uncomfortable. These lenses were completely covered in glass and the eye, which may explain the pain that patients who were undergoing. About 50 later, the first lenses Plexiglas came on the market. But  they had one big drawback: it was impossible to wear these lenses for  over an hour or two, because they prevented the flow of lacrimal fluid  between the lens and the eye.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In the 50s, a lens floating on the tear fluid was invented. You could wear it for a whole day. Manufacturers  Bausch &amp; Lomb launched a soft contact lens in 1971, which was the  starting point of the commercial success of the lenses. They were well above the level qualite and comfort. Since  the 70s, the contact lenses were developed, and today we can even find  lenses that can be worn 24 hours 24, 30 days straight.
             <br/>
             Different types of lenses
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Today you have many options when you want to buy new lenses, which can be quite disconcerting. To help, here are more details on some of them.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Daily Disposable Contact Lenses
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If you choose this type of contact lenses, you will not have much to consider. They work exactly as their name indicates. Simply open the pack, insert the lenses, wear them, then throw them at the end of the day. With  this type of lenses, you will minimize the risk of eye infection, since  you will not need to use cleaning solution, or to maintain them daily. They are cheap to replace if you lose them, and not binding. However, if you wear contact lenses every day, it is perhaps not the most economical solution.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Monthly lenses
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Monthly contact lenses are the most common, which is probably due to their low price compared to others. However, if you choose this type of correction, you should consider maintaining a daily basis. At the end of the day, these lenses must be removed and stored in a pouch filled lens solution.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The colored contact lenses
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The  colored contact lenses are becoming more popular, which is probably due  to the fact that even those who do not suffer from vision problems can  wear them. You can completely change the color of your eyes or just enhance your basic color, you decide. These lenses may be daily or monthly.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Specialty contact lenses
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Today you can find lenses that will correct virtually all types of vision problems. For example, if you have astigmatism, toric lenses choose. If you suffer from degradation due to aging, select progressive lenses.
             <br/>
             To take into account
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Whatever your choice of contact lenses, do not forget to have clean hands when introducing and removing the lenses. Otherwise, you risk an eye infection. If you choose monthly, you will also need to change holster from time to time. For indeed, microorganisms can begin to grow in this environment, which is obviously not good for your eyes.
             <br/>
             Is there an alternative to contact lenses?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If the lenses you think hard, there are several alternatives. Apart from the glasses, you can also solve your problem with LASIK. It is a procedure that surgeons do every day and gives very good results. Contact your eye doctor if you are considering an operation, but know it will take a month or two months of recovery.

            Varicose veins, unsightly but benign

             Varicose veins are apparent signs of venous insufficiency. To prevent the appearance of these unsightly veins and leg feel heavy, several effective treatments exist. Review details.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If  varicose veins affect about one in two women, men also are not immune  to the appearance of these unsightly veins mainly on the legs. Except  that they are unsightly, varicose veins are the visible sign of venous  insufficiency which can cause different people more or less serious  complications.
             <br/>
             Varicose veins?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Varicose veins are visible on the surface of the skin that appear most often in the legs. They are the outward signs of venous insufficiency, ie, stagnation of blood in the veins dilate abnormally. Generally, venous insufficiency occurs when valves in veins are altered. The valves are located inside the veins. They are used to prevent reflux because of weightlessness amount of blood to the heart of the feet. If a valve is impaired, it can no longer perform its role of "flap" anti reflux. Blood flow is then slowed down resulting in stagnation. Knowing that the walls of veins are naturally loose, and the vein swells is the appearance of the varix. Typically,  varicose veins are consecutive or an abnormality of the venous wall  following injury, for example, or when the tone of the vein wall is weak  due to illness, tobacco, etc. ...
             <br/>
             What causes it? What risks?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Varicose veins are unsightly but generally benign. Nevertheless,  the stagnation of blood in the legs can sometimes encourage the  development of edema, nocturnal cramps, tingling or a sensation of heavy  legs. In severe cases, the malfunctioning of traffic can give rise to ulcers of the skin prone to infection. The most commonly accepted causes are age and gender (women are more prone to varicose veins than men). Some families are naturally predisposed to varicose veins. Physical  inactivity increases the phenomenon and the overweight, regular  exposure to heat, wearing too high heels and tight clothing. Persons in positions requiring prolonged standing to trample are also more often prone to varicose veins.
             <br/>
             The treatment of varicose veins
             <br/>
             <br/>
             There are several types of treatments to fight against varicose veins. The  most used is to take drugs such veinotonic whose main interest lies in  the fact that they increase the resistance of the veins and improve  circulation. The second possibility once the varices are installed is surgery. The  operation is called stripping in the most severe cases to remove the  main vein of the legs (saphenous vein) by making two incisions, one in  the ankle, the other in the groin. The return of blood is then provided by the deep veins. The rebuilding must wear compression stockings to prevent blood clots.

             It Alfonso Caycedo which is the origin of relaxation therapy in 1960. It  can be defined as a science and discipline that preaches positivity, by  becoming aware of his being to be in harmony with his personality.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The Art of Being Positive A positive attitude can only have in fact beneficial consequences for the body. And this also applies in reverse. It is thus used in order to regain self-esteem or even strengthen it.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Inspired  by western thoughts, hypnosis and also Eastern philosophy like Yoga or  Zen mind, relaxation therapy aims to balance the attitudes and emotions  and have a better life.
             <br/>
             Fundamental theories
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It has basic principles which the first is to become aware of his body causing the body schema as it really is. When  feeling really the body, relaxation dynamics facilitates contact  between sensations, motor which is the physical and psychic perception,  the goal of establishing harmonization.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The second principle emphasizes the positive focus on our body so that the reflected in the totality of being. Based  on this principle of repercussion, relaxation therapy does not appeal  to the negative elements so as not to spread the body in the mind.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The third calls for reality in action. Thus,  it encourages us to look things in the face and take them as they are,  it is also a preliminary step to personal development.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It is therefore a real awareness in both the sophrologist itself at the level of his patients. Thus, the method does not apply only to subjects. The methods are based primarily on these three tenets, however, two others are not neglected. Thus, we must know accommodate situations to appropriate methods and make a reality of the body schema to live.
             <br/>
             Relaxation therapy and techniques
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As  for the techniques themselves are distinguished primarily DRC or  dynamic relaxation of Caycedo that open to progressive results. They practiced standing or sitting and group classes. The  method has two degrees and a holistic approach, using many techniques,  that this practice is more effective than sophronisations specific. The DRC took place between half an hour to an hour and sessions to decrease rather driving force. This is also the time that the DRC act more slowly, reaching a balance and well being deeper. And for more results, we recommend students to practice relaxation therapy at home in a casual and airy. In most cases it is used in particular in the fight against pain, stress or even help prepare for childbirth. Just then deepen the specific exercises and practice them alone (e) punctually.

            The crisis of adolescence

             The crisis of adolescence is a must for any individual becoming adult. And generally, it can be very difficult to live for both parents and the adolescent himself.
             <br/>
             Change crisis
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The child who grows up and becomes a teenager saw many changes and especially thirst for freedom and autonomy. Although  the crisis that occurs during this period may have several causes, it  is generally manifested by irritability of the adolescent to any form of  authority. This is also the main source of small wars with parents. However, aggression is not the main characteristic of this period more or less hectic life of a human being. It  is not uncommon for the emerging sexuality has its share of problems  and behaviors typical of a young man or young girl of 15 years. Problems related to food including, for example bulimia and / or anorexia which mainly affects girls and boys may also appear.
             <br/>
             A passage more or less turbulent
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As a result, parents often dread the moment when their children reach this critical period of their lives. And when they are, how to behave towards him or her when it seems impossible to conduct a normal conversation? The teenager is actually trying to compose a personality and get a place in the universe of family and society. Not only it is no longer a child but it is not yet an adult. It can be so frustrating to want his independence and make as big as we are still under the control of parents. According  to one expert, the teenager is aggressive because he fears being  influenced by her parents and dreads the same to be delivered to himself  because he grew up. Do not believe the plight does not affect it as much as it affects parents. He / she is suffering though he / she does not express it.
             <br/>
             Parental Attitudes
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If  it was still easy enough to keep the adolescent crisis a few years ago,  today's parents do not know sometimes what to do before a teenager in  crisis they are finally calling a professional to fix it. However,  before use of mass media, some attitudes may help reduce distances and  thereby to live quietly with an adolescent (e) in the house. Of  the opposition that he / she shows he / she tries to show his  individuality and he / she can think and act for him / herself and he /  she is no longer a (e) child whose parents should guide the conduct. Also,  parents will show through their daily behavior, a pattern of conduct by  following their own advice they wish to convey to the adolescent (e). Thus,  the mother who wants to be closer to his teenage daughter by organizing  outings with her must be careful because it can turn against her. Indeed, when she refuses output it could not understand why and not before this time? Place the markers is then essential that the crisis of adolescence does not happen too easily.

            Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
           </a>
          </h3>
          <div class="entry-content">
           <input name="zemanta-related" type="hidden" val=""/>

            <p>
             Or EMDR, Eye Movement desentization and reprocessing is a technique akin to hypnosis. Utilizing  Ericksonian hypnosis that can reach easily and accurately a past  trauma, EMDR is a new form of hypnosis which is based mainly on eye  movements.
             <br/>
             The eyes, opening the soul
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The eyes are indeed regarded as the gateway to the soul and the brain too. And the gymnastics of the eye helps to relieve somewhat the brain which has stopped a traumatic event. This  method is often used in neurotherapy since it acts on the unconscious  as well as on the mechanisms of the brain including neurons. Eyes  stimulated by rhythmic movements will make the patient relive the  accident that causes psychological stress or depression and this, in a  light trance state. Then, the clinician in  reaching the unconscious will ensure that desensitizes the patient's  consciousness and towards a self-healing.
             <br/>
             EMDR as an accelerator of the healing plan
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Furthermore,  EMDR is most effective when it is deemed to be a therapy program  because it focuses primarily on behavioral changes due to post-traumatic  shock. An association with NLP can also be useful when the patient has trouble getting out of negative cognitions. The meeting itself is to follow the next pointer and it takes about 3-12 sessions count, 8 being the average. The sessions last between an hour and a half hours. Thus, it is part of a therapeutic approach rather brief and tolerated by many patients.
             <br/>
             One method that medicine has not yet recognized
             <br/>
             <br/>
             However,  its therapeutic benefit is not yet officially recognized what proves to  be very effective in relieving stress generated by assault, accident,  rape or moral pressure. Thus, it allows  the traumatized person to break free of a weight which poisons life and  that is reflected in their attitudes on a daily basis.
             <br/>
             Specialists question
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Admittedly,  the method is simple, it is always advisable however to practice EMDR  in the presence of an experienced practitioner and recognized. It is indeed essential to turn to a specialist when it comes to neurotherapy. In addition, reliving a traumatic memory remains difficult and is not without dangers. Consequently, patient preparation and selection of the appropriate method is necessary to avoid further undermining the latter. The professionalism and security must be highlighted in search of your therapist. Doctors and psychologists trained in psychotherapy and can practice EMDR. As  the method uses the faculties of the individual to heal itself and it  takes place in a timely manner and quick, the results of EMDR are  intimately connected with the deep desire of the person to heal. The therapist is there to help him cope with his demons and to support it.
