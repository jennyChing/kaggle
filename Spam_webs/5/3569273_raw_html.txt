         that someone from his government meet with him, his family, and his
         <br/>
         support committee (see numbers and sample letter below)
        </p>
        <p>
         2. Join the Protest Monday, September 19, 12 Noon, at 25 Grosvenor Street (two blocks north of Yonge and College in downtown Toronto), at the office of Corrections Minister Monte Kwinter, then walk to Queen's Park to demand a meeting with the Premier (if you can come a few minutes before noon that would be great!)
        </p>
        <p>
         Friday, Sept. 16 -- Secret Trial detainee Mohammad Mahjoub, held over five years without charge or bail on secret evidence neither he nor his lawyers is allowed to see, is weak, in pain, and has requested hospitalization. On his 72nd day without food, Mahjoub is reporting that any type of movement is difficult. He experiences frequent kidney pain lasting an hour or two which comes in waves, is experiencing shortness of breath, especially at
         <br/>
         night, when he has major trouble sleeping, wakes up with chest pain, and there are signs that his blood circulation is in decline. During an attempt to take a blood test on Thursday, nurses reportedly told him it was difficult to get blood out of his arm.
        </p>
        <p>
         "I've never seen myself like this before," Mahjoub says. "The last two days it has felt like a sharp knife going through my abdomen." Mahjoub, who weighed 225 pounds before his first hunger strike in jail (he has had to undergo several of them), now weighs 140 pounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although Mahjoub has had an ultrasound and X-ray in the past few days, we are concerned that at any time, he may suffer a severe drop in blood pressure and go into a coma. He is not hooked up to any medical devices monitoring his heart, respiration, or blood pressure, so the chances of him slipping into a coma without anyone noticing are in fact quite high.
        </p>
        <p>
         "If I am in a coma who will know?" a very weak Mahjoub said from Metro West today. "If it happens at night, they won't find me till the morning. I want people to know, I have done nothing wrong, and yet they treat me this way. Where is the evidence against me? Why do they humiliate me and my wife and children?"
        </p>
        <p>
         Mahjoub is trying to get touch visits with his children, who are only allowed to see him through thick plexiglass and speak over crackly telephones. He is also demanding medical treatment for the Hepatitis C he contracted in jail (he has been denied a much needed liver biopsy), a leg injury, and glasses for his failing eyes.

         Re: 72-Day Hunger strike of Mohammad Mahjoub
        </p>
        <p>
         Dear Mr. McGuinty
        </p>
        <p>
         I am writing to urge you to take immediate action to meet the legitimate demands of Mohammad Mahjoub, who has been detained without trial in an Ontario prison for over five years and is now on Day 72 of a hunger strike (Sept. 16) to demand minimally decent conditions of detention. His main demands include proper medical treatment for the Hepatitis C he contracted at the jail (a prescribed liver biopsy has been denied), proper medical care for as knee injury sustained at the jail, filling a long-neglected
         <br/>
         prescription for eyeglasses, and touch visits with his young children once a month.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given that Mr. Mahjoub is not hooked up to any medical monitoring devices, there is a real danger that his blood pressure may take a sudden drop and send him into a coma without anyone knowing before it is too late. Mr. Mahjoub has requested that he be hospitalized given his extremely weak, and painful state. He also needs authorized individuals from your government to meet with him, his family, and his legal representatives to negotiate a solution to this crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         *******Mr. Mahjoub has requested that you or someone from your government immediately contact his authorized representative and friend, Matthew Behrens, at (416) 651-5800 or
         <a href="mailto:tasc@web.ca">
          tasc@web.ca
         </a>
         , to arrange an emergency meeting to include Mona Elfouli, who is married to Mahjoub, to reach a just and humane solution.
        </p>
        <p>
         So far, there has been no response from Monte Kwinter, whose portfolio includes responsibility for detainees in provincial detention centres, and time is running out on Mr. Mahjoub.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although Mr. Mahjoub is a federal detainee, he is within your jurisdiction in a provincial jail, and it is therefore your responsibility to respond to this crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Montreal-based medical professionals have stated, in a letter to Prime Minister Paul Martin, that Mahjoub is at imminent risk of permanent, severe impairment, and very possibly, of death.
        </p>
        <p>
         By way of comparison: in 1981, Bobby Sands and 9 other IRA prisoners on hunger strike died after periods varying from 46 to 73 days after sustaining severe organ damage (e.g., blindness). Several survivors of the strike remained permanently handicapped. In 1996, many Kurdish hunger strikers in Turkey died after periods of 65 to 69 days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Please intervene immediately to try to find a humane solution to this situation. You have the power, and therefore the moral  responsibility, to resolve this crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surely it is not too much to ask for a monthly contact visit with two small children and for proper medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Canadians, we pride ourselves on respecting basic human rights. Please remain true to this fundamental value. Should Mohammad Mahjoub die or be permanently handicapped, it would be to our lasting shame and dishonour as Canadians and as members of the human family.
        </p>
        <p>
         I look forward to your prompt response to my letter and to positive action to resolve this crisis.

        <p>
         Re: Detention conditions of Mohammad Mahjoub
        </p>
        <p>
         Dear Ministers,
        </p>
        <p>
         As legal and medical professionals, we are writing to urge you to take
         <br/>
         immediate action to meet the legitimate demands of  Mohammad Mahjoub,
         <br/>
         detained under a security certificate, now on Day 71 of a hunger strike to
         <br/>
         demand minimally decent conditions of detention. Mr. Mahjoub was already
         <br/>
         in poor health before beginning his hunger strike, and is at imminent risk
         <br/>
         of permanent, severe impairment or death. As of today, we are informed
         <br/>
         that Mr. Mahjoub is too weak to stand up, and his eyesight is failing. He
         <br/>
         needs to be hospitalized, and also to be assured that his demands will
         <br/>
         receive serious consideration so that he will put an end to his hunger
         <br/>
         strike.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr. Mahjoub has been detained for over five years at the Toronto West
         <br/>
         Detention Centre, a provincial remand facility normally intended for
         <br/>
         short-term detention for those awaiting trial, serving short sentences, or
         <br/>
         awaiting transfer to a penitentiary or reformatory after trial. For over a
         <br/>
         year, he has been placed in segregation for his own protection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indefinite detention without charge on the basis of secret evidence flies
         <br/>
         in the face of basic principles of justice and due process. In addition,
         <br/>
         Mohammad Mahjoub and other security certificate detainees are held in
         <br/>
         conditions that are far worse than those of most convicted criminals,
         <br/>
         despite the fact that they have never been charged with any crime, much
         <br/>
         less found guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mohammad Mahjoub's main demands include proper medical treatment for
         <br/>
         hepatitis C (a prescribed liver biopsy has been denied), proper medical
         <br/>
         care for a knee injury sustained at the jail, filling a prescription for
         <br/>
         eyeglasses, and touch visits with his young children once a month.
        </p>
        <p>
         Depriving Mohammad Mahjoub of the right to periodic contact visits with
         <br/>
         his two young children for over five years is extraordinarily punitive and
         <br/>
         a form of psychological abuse, both for Mr. Mahjoub and his loved ones.
         <br/>
         This aggravates the severe, chronic stress to which Mr. Mahjoub is
         <br/>
         subjected because he is being indefinitely detained without trial, and
         <br/>
         because he is under threat of deportation to Egypt where (according to a
         <br/>
         July 2004 assessment by Immigration Canada) he would probably "suffer
         <br/>
         ill-treatment
         <br/>
         and human rights abuses".
        </p>
        <p>
         We are particularly concerned about the denial of a liver biopsy,
         <br/>
         recommended in September 2004 by a gastroenterologist, Dr. Anderson, after
         <br/>
         having examined Mr. Mahjoub. For a person diagnosed with hepatitis C (as
         <br/>
         is Mr. Mahjoub), a liver biopsy is an essential test to determine how far
         <br/>
         the disease has progressed, and therefore what treatment should be
         <br/>
         provided. Treatment for hepatitis C is only effective in about 40% of
         <br/>
         cases and has very severe side effects, so treatment should not be
         <br/>
         undertaken unless clearly warranted. On the other hand, symptoms of liver
         <br/>
         damage due to hepatitis C may not be apparent for several years, by which
         <br/>
         time the damage can be considerable and even irreversible, often resulting
         <br/>
         in end-stage liver disease, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. A liver
         <br/>
         biopsy is the only means to precisely establish the stage to which the
         <br/>
         hepatitis C has progressed in order to decide whether treatment should be
         <br/>
         initiated.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a letter dated March 15, 2005, Dr. Roland Fuca of Citizenship and
         <br/>
         Immigration Canada overruled the treating gastroenterologist's
         <br/>
         recommendation, without having personally examined Mr. Mahjoub. Dr. Fuca
         <br/>
         writes: "It was made clear to me by CBSA that any transfer of this patient
         <br/>
         did involve considerable security risks and necessarily would result in
         <br/>
         the deployment of significant resources". Although informed that Mr
         <br/>
         Mahjoub did not wish to initiate treatment without a biopsy, he concludes
         <br/>
         that "there does not exist a medical necessity to perform a liver biopsy
         <br/>
         on Mr. Mahjoub at this time".
        </p>
        <p>
         Overruling the recommendation of the treating specialist without even
         <br/>
         examining the patient, largely on the grounds that the security costs
         <br/>
         during hospitalization would be too high, is very dubious in terms of
         <br/>
         professional ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
         More fundamentally, failure to provide appropriate medical treatment to
         <br/>
         detainees (including diagnostic testing) is unconscionable. It is also
         <br/>
         contrary to domestic law and international norms. More specifically, it is
         <br/>
         contrary to the following provisions:
        </p>
        <p>
         Ministry of Correctional Services Act (Ontario)
        </p>
        <p>
         24 (1) Where an inmate requires medical treatment that cannot be supplied
         <br/>
         at the correctional institution, the superintendent shall arrange for the
         <br/>
         inmate to be conveyed to a hospital or other health facility.
        </p>
        <p>
         United Nations' Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners
        </p>
        <p>
         22 (2) Sick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be
         <br/>
         transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. (..)

        </p>
        <p>
         Principle 24. (.) medical care and treatment shall be provided whenever
         <br/>
         necessary. This care and treatment shall be provided free of charge.

         9. Prisoners shall have access to the health services available in the
         <br/>
         country without discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We urge you to intervene without delay to ensure that Mohammad Mahjoub and
         <br/>
         other individuals detained under security certificates are treated in a
         <br/>
         way that fully respects their human rights and takes into consideration
         <br/>
         their status as long-term detainees, who have not been accused or
         <br/>
         convicted of any crime. More especially, we ask that you act immediately
         <br/>
         to make sure that Mohammad Mahjoub does not die or suffer permanent,
         <br/>
         irreversible damage to his health.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sincerely,

         OCAP is a direct-action anti-poverty organization based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We mount campaigns against regressive government policies as they affect poor and working people. In addition, we provide direct-action advocacy for individuals against welfare and ODSP, public housing and others who deny poor people what they are entitled to.  We believe in the power of people to organize themselves.
