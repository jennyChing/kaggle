     <p>
      Yesterday marked the launch of Google+ Collections. Id like to be less clich than hailing it as Googles answer to
      <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">
       Pinterest
      </a>
      at this early stage even though similarities are evident. 'Collections undeniably provides us with an easy, efficient way to organise and curate the best content from around the web.
     </p>
     <p>
      Creating a collection is as simple as navigating to the Collections tab underneath your cover photo and allocating your collection a name and its desired visibility. Custom audiences are formed from a number of Google+ circles if youre looking to refine your scope. Collections can also be set to  Only Me. This is my favourite aspect of collections thus far. Share the best posts or ideas from Google+ to your own private collection and create a drawing board for future articles, or simply as a personal bookmarking tool.
     </p>
     <p>
      After creating your collection you are able to customise your collection image and colour scheme. Note  it is not possible to change the visibility settings of a collection after it has gone live. From here on the collection and the content contained within is completely at the discretion of the user.
     </p>
     <p>
      See Heather Buckley's
      <a href="http://heatherbuckley.co.uk/google-plus-collections-how-to-use-them/" target="_blank">
       'Google Plus Collections and How to Use Them'
      </a>
      for a comprehensive guide on creating collections.

      BREAKING NEWS - Your tweets are already appearing in Google search!
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier today we sent out a tweet about using analogies in
      <a href="https://www.siliconbeachtraining.co.uk/project-management-training/project-management">
       Project Management
      </a>
      written by, Project Management Solutions, a US based Project Management college.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within an hour, we were looking up the author so that we could let him know we had tweeted him - always a good idea as it can help build relationships on your social media accounts. Our tweet appeared in the Google serps.

      usually ends with a 'Lightning Talks' session but this year Kelvin switched up the format and introduced a '
      <strong>
       Greatest Tips Session
      </strong>
      '.
     </p>
     <p>
      The idea: every speaker from the day shares their top actionableSEO tip that attendees can start using when back in the office on Monday morning. We particularly liked the idea because it meant a chance to catch tips from speakers which we'd missed on the day.
     </p>
     <p>
      We came away with 21 fantastic tips which we couldn't help but share with those who couldn't make it on Friday.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can watch the full video, skim through the quick tips, or read the full transcript with ourthoughts below.

      Is it possible to increase search visibility without building links?

      At

      in April
      <strong>
       Semantic Search
      </strong>
      was a popular topic that featured in many talks andI also had the pleasure of taking part in a Semantic Search Roundtable discussion, sponsored by
      <a href="http://www.intelligentpositioning.com/en/" target="_blank">
       Intelligent Positioning
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      My inspiration for this post was
      <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_Isidoro" target="_blank">

      </a>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_Isidoro" target="_blank">

      's post
      <a href="http://moz.com/blog/i-am-an-entity-hacking-the-knowledge-graph" target="_blank">
       'I Am an Entity: Hacking the Knowledge Graph'
      </a>
      and companiontalk at BrightonSEO. Read his post and then watch the talk below:

     <section class="video ">
      <div class="video-container">
       <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="354" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/utw-NyiURv4" width="629">

     </section>
     <p>
      It is also worth reading
      <a href="https://twitter.com/krystianszastok">
       Krystian
      </a>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/krystianszastok">
       Szastok
      </a>
      's follow up post
      <a href="http://moz.com/ugc/i-became-an-entity-how-im-on-the-knowledge-graph" target="_blank">
       'I Became an Entity: How I'm on the Knowledge Graph'
      </a>
      which gives further evidence of becoming an entity with some additional tips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Andrew and Krystian's posts are both excellent reads, but they focus on individuals and the knowledge graph.
     </p>
     <p>
      I also want to focus on businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      How can businesses get themselves into the knowledge graph, and also take advantage of the other features of semantic search?
     </p>
     <p>
      First, a bit of theory about why this is so important.
