        Thank you to Stoneline Designs Conference Tables for hosting this quiz.

       My intent with this page is not to suggest that Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are the same as Usama Bin Ladin, that they espouse the same beliefs, or have the same goals. I only hope to point out the (to me) disturbing similarities in their rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p class="sidebar">
       I had intended to post a table comparing similar statements about the evils of secular government and hedonistic America. My friend Joe suggested a quiz instead, and I ended up with this page.
      </p>
      <p class="sidebar">
       Each quote is condensed from a longer statement. Terms specific to Islam or Christianity have been replaced with generic words. Complete, unedited quotes are included with the answers. Some of the translations of Usama Bin Ladin are a bit odd; that's just the way it is.
      </p>
      <p class="sidebar">
       In the original quiz, I wrote "[Allah/God]" wherever the deity was referred to. Several people have pointed out to me that since "Allah" is the Islamic name for "God," it is appropriate to simply write "God." Which is what I have done. However, I did not edit the longer quotes that follow the quiz; if they translated "Allah" as "Allah," I left it as it was.
      </p>
      <p class="sidebar">
       Thanks to suggestions from people who took the quiz, I have also changed the format a bit: you no longer have to distinguish between Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, only between the two of them and Usama Bin Ladin. Because of the format change, I have also changed a couple of the questions.
      </p>
      <p class="sidebar">
       I put this page up for my friends and never expected so many people to read it. Many thanks to everyone who's taken the quiz &amp; especially those who took the time to write. It means a lot to me. Even the angry letters, which make me acutely aware of how lucky I am to live in a country which cherishes freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
