     Why is Low Body Temperature Important? 

   The body's enzymatic processes slow over 10%, sometimes 20% per 
degree of temperature below the "optimum" 98.6 F. Slower chemical function, repair, 
and disposal of local and environmental toxins puts the body below 
expected function. This can cause many symptoms and syndromes, such as 
those listed to the right. Obviously, not all chronic problems are 
related to chronic low body temperature; but if several of these are noted, 
it may be prudent to
     <a href="#Measure">
      measure
     </a>
     one's body 
temperature on a routine basis to see if chronic low body temperature is a possibility.

      Overview: The Endless Loop
     </h2>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     Mind, nutrition, and body feed back upon each other in an endless loop.
This long document mentions things all three areas.  You may want to book
mark it, or better yet, print it out, mark it up adding your own notes and ideas
as thoughts and understanding grow slowly.
     <p>
      Often, the problem lies in all three areas; but if you get the body to 
work right, mood often improves and appetite often sharpens to trigger 
desires for the specific nutrients that one needs. (At least if one 
stays away from non-nutritional flavorings, fake foods, and sweeteners; 
all of which can interfere with the wisdom of the body and upset its 
sense of inner balance -- which people don't care about till they are in trouble.) 
The mind may drag the body a short distance; 
but it is the body which carries the mind for a lifetime.  Fix the 
body, and the mind will follow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here are some things others have tried.  You may wish to consider 
them.  Tell us about your experiences and attempts on the chat page. (at end)
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Some people can learn to turn on the inner warmth via meditation
and/or visualization,  and thus break the cycle; 
it is a temporary respite which, when practiced, can lead
to longer term improvement for some...
      </li>
      <li>
       Exercise will generate considerable internal heat. For some,
exercising three or more times a week will break the cold cycle; but not
for all.
      </li>
      <li>
       Nutrition helps many, Molybdenum, Choline, Alpha Lipoic
Acid and Coenzyme Q 10 have help some; but again, not all.
      </li>
      <li>
       Molybdenum has been particularly useful for those who feel cold all 
the time.  (But many feel rooms are hot when it is they who are cold.)
      </li>
      <li>
       Supplemental Iodine or Dulse soup has cured some forms of low body temperature.
But again, not all.
      </li>
      <li>
       Low copper levels or broken copper enzyme paths, which can cause high copper levels, may 
be associated with some forms of low body temperature.  The low levels are easier to remedy 
than the high.
      </li>
      <li>
       Adequate, sometimes prolonged, sleep helps some; but again, not all.
It is important that body temperature not drop too far during the night,
or the benefits of sleep are greatly diminished, even extinguished.
      </li>
      <li>
       Exposure to bright lights in the morning helps "wake the mind" and
then the body for some; but not all.  Those whom it helps are often said
to have "Seasonal Adjustive Disorder", aka "SAD".
      </li>
      <li>
       Avoidance of bright lights, and computer displays with light
backgrounds in the evening helps the mind get ready for night.  Bright 
light delays the melatonin cycles which regulate sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
       A very hot bath upon rising in the morning, one that prompts the body
to sweat a bit, has helped some by teaching the body to run at a higher temperature.  As have 
warm showers before bed if temperature drops too low at night.
      </li>
      <li>
       There are cyclical thyroid supplementation programs available that 
break the mind-body part of the cycle for many people.  When this works, 
the disorder is often called Wilson's Temperature Syndrome (WTS). Some are cured in weeks 
or months; others can take many cycles before the body "catches on". 
Some are able to use other techniques besides hormones to cycle their 
body temperature till the body learns to run better.
      </li>
      <li>
       Some, those with some kinds of thyroid disorders, may need
continuous thyroid supplementation. Others may do well with potassium iodide supplements 
(KKSI). But again, not all.
      </li>
      <li>
       Some of this may be related to
       <a href="http://www.mall-net.com/mcs/porphyria.html">
        porphyria
       </a>
       ,
a rare blood disorder, which can cause anemia, and thus deprive the body
of enough oxygen for normal robust operation.  There are many other causes
of anemia, some far more common than porphyria.
      </li>
      <li>
       Long term after-effects of Carbon Monoxide poisoning can also cause low body temperature.  See
       <a href="http://mcsrr.org">
        www.MCSRR.org
       </a>
       for more information.  These efffects can persist for Years.
I got them escaping a forest fire in 2008.
       <p>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       Microfilliary worms and parasites are cited by some as causing low body temperature. Some 
of these people find that raising body temperature via other means kills the worms and lets 
the body maintain a higher, more normal temperature.  For others, killing the worms comes first.
      </li>
      <li>
       Old sayings speak of adding root vegetables like rutabagas and carrots with their potent anti-fungals to the diet.
      </li>
      <li>
       Other sayings speak of adding legumes such as string beans
to the diet.
      </li>
      <li>
       Folk lore from other parts of the world mentions adding spices like ginger root and red hot peppers to the diet.  Hot peppers will make this author 
warmer, and the memory of how that felt was used in biofeedback training using a simple digital thermometer.  More below.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
     </p>
     <dd>
      There are many problems which will cause chronic low body temperature,
from post traumatic stress syndrome to warts, from Candida Albecans to
Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. What will help you, depends upon the cause and
the state of your body. In the long run, the mind tends to follow the
body; but in the short run, you have to use your mind to drag youself toward a cure regardless of what people keep telling you.
It's your body, YOU know whether it is running right or not.
Heal and nurture the body properly, and the mind will begin to sparkle
again.
      <p>
       And if your mind isn't sparkling, FIND OUT WHY!  It's your life, how do you want to live it?  DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

Long
term physiological consequences are listed on Dr. Cathcart's
      <a href="http://www.mall-net.com/cathcart/wilsons.html">

     <h4>
      Melatonin, Serotonin, and Moods
     </h4>
     The brain adjusts its "focus" by adjusting metabolism via
circulation. It uses Serotonin, which relaxes smooth muscles in blood
vessel wall, thus dilating them; and cells that absorb, hold, and release
Serotonin on demand to accomplish this.  Hence, circulatory adjustments
needed to maintain temperature may also affect thought processes; as may
low levels of L-Tryptophan and Niacin, which the body uses to produce
Serotonin and Melatonin.
     <p>
      Low Serotonin levels are commonly found in depression, hence
the prescription of SSRI's in depression.  Many of these SSRI's are also
cytochrome P450 consumers, and can put some at risk for
      <a href="porphyria.html">
       porphyria
      </a>
      , which is common in people with
multiple chemical sensitivities, and becomes worse as enzymatic
processes slow due to low body temperature / chronic hypothermia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low body temperature is 
also
often found in depression.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low Melatonin levels are often found in those who have difficulty in
sleeping, or who have sleep irregularities.  Melatonin is suppressed by
exposure to light, and may be delayed by nocturnal exposure bright lights,
including light TV and CRT backgrounds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paradoxically, while L-Tryptophan and Melatonin appear to induce sleep via
body temperature reduction, there is some evidence that the proper
cyclical production of Melatonin and Serotonin may boost daytime body
temperature. (Some say melatonin takes a few days to get use to. Take only before bedtime.  
Effective dosage varies markedly from person to person.)

     The point is that one needs to rev up one's metabolic processes. That
can be via both physiological, and psychological methods.  Simply putting
on warmer clothing is usually not enough, and in some cases may make
things worse due to metabolic reductions the body may make in effort to
maintain the low body temperature.  This is what causes hot days to be so
difficult for such people.  And yet... if it is only the head temperature
that is cycling, then perhaps putting on the old thinking cap, a warm
loose fitting hat or cap, may be enough to raise brain temperature back to
reasonable norms.  Perhaps worth trying for some.

    Measurement
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Body temperature measurements should be made 3, 6, and 9 hours
after rising using a GLASS thermometer, then averaged. Ref: Dr. Wilson,
"Wilson's Syndrome".  (I measure it hourly for a few days.)
     <br/>
     See
     <a href="http://www.mall-net.com/mcs/thermom.html">
      Thermometers
and Techniques
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Body temperature seems to vary with time and activity.  It is not
supposed to be steady!
    </li>
    <li>
     There is a day/night temperature cycle, with temperature rising
notably as one is awakening.  (Hence the difficulties in judging ovulation
by the body temperature method.)
    </li>
    <li>
     There are reports, both scientific and anecdotal, of shorter term 
temperature cycling.
    </li>
    <li>
     Some report as much as half a degree, even a full degree of
variation between repeated high temperatures and repeated low temperatures
on a three to six minute cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
     Glass thermometers deliver an averaged temperature
    </li>
    <li>
     Electronic thermometers deliver a maximum temperature.
     <br/>
     See
     <a href="http://www.mall-net.com/mcs/thermom.html">
      Thermometers
and Techniques
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Maximum and Average temperature is likely to be different between
glass and electronic thermometers EVEN IF both thermometers show identical
temperatures in a calibration setup. (E. G. very slowly warmed water
bath.)
    </li>
    <li>
     Electronic in-ear IR (Infra Red) thermometers appear, in this writer's experience, to 
be difficult to get consistent temperatures from.  Angle of insertion will vary, considerably 
varying the resulting readings.  Readings did not correspond to oral temperatures, being at 
times over a degree higher, or over two degrees lower, than simultaneous oral measurements.  
Consecutive measurements taken immediately following each other have varied as much as three 
degrees.  Thus in-ear IR thermometers appear unworkable for this purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
     Cycles can be measured by using an electronic thermometer, and
turning it off and on between readings
     <strong>
      without
     </strong>
     removing
it from the mouth.  That way, the physical sensor will remain at body
temperature, but the maximum reading will be reset to the present body
temperature when the thermometer is turned on.
    </li>
    <li>
     Take readings every half minute: Read the electronic thermometer
     <strong>
      without moving it in the mouth
     </strong>
     , turn it off and on to
reset the maximum, then read it again. (You may need to have another
person take the readings.) Repeat till you get two clear and distinct
peaks separated by a low.  This gives you the peak, low, and cycle time
for your

     .
    </li>
    <li>
     Some suggest that head (oral) temperature may vary from core body
temperature.   Wearing a hat might help
     <strong>
      if
     </strong>
     this is the
case.
    </li>
    <li>
     Particularly intersting are the reports of temperature differences
between the sides of the head resulting in mood changes.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    This author has had some success learning to raise body temperature by remembering the 
feeling of hot foods like red peppers. This is a form of biofeedback training anyone can try 
with an ordinary digital thermometer. Whether the temperature remains high for long is 
another matter; but it was a start at regaining control so warm social matters could be 
handled with warmth, and cool headed matters with the best analytical coolness.  (This 
author, a systems analyst, favors self training to improve your ability to shift mental 
gears as needed.  If that fail, then try the Wilson's cytomel approach.)
