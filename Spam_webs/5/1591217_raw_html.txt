    Why are there so many scandals within the Catholic Church?
    <hr width="100%"/>
    Sexual misconduct charges brought against Catholic priests have generated big 
media headlines and the detractors and haters of the Catholic Church are having 
a field day, temporarily. I said "temporarily" because of the record of
    <a href="protest.htm">
     survivability
    </a>
    of the Catholic 
Church for almost two millennia, and of the "person" who is its head.
    <br/>
    But 
before continuing, let us put this particular scandal into its proper 
context.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. The Catholic Church is more than four times as large as all 
of non-Catholic Christianity combined. Since 1950 the Church in the United 
States has had 109,694 priests. During that time period of over fifty years, 
4392 (as reported in February 2004) were accused of molesting minors, or about 
four percent. Remember, that number is the total number of those charged and not 
the number of those found guilty. We can not be so naive as to ignore the fact 
that many of those are false charges and were brought about by greed 
inhopes of gaininga monetary settlement. We remember the person who 
falsely accused the Archbishop of Chicago and who later dropped the charge, 
saying that he had lied. Keep in mind that those allegedly chargedwith 
pedophilia are a small minority of the total charged.
    <br/>
    Keep in mind also that 
these figures did not come about all at once recently, but are spread out as far 
back as 1950, over 50 years ago. Some of the accused priests were discharged by 
the Church decades ago and hundreds of others have since passed away, making any 
defense in their behalf an impossibility.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, we could not have had 
Jesus Christ as a Savior without also having a Judas to betray Him.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    2. 
Thesesupposed sexual abuse problems are not a Catholic clergy monopoly, as 
the guilty are in all non-Catholic Christian denominations as well.Recent 
figures have shown that an average of 3500 religious in non-Catholic sects are 
charged similarly every year. What with tens of thousands of individual 
Christian sects in the world today, these abuses do not receive the attention 
given to the Catholic Church by the media.
    <br/>
    Some of the tens of thousands of 
non-Catholic sects openly acknowledge that they "ordain" homosexual ministers. 
How many of those would you suppose are pedophiles?
    <br/>
    However, it is the 
Catholic Church which has always been the "bulls-eye" of the target of 
detractors since its very beginning almost 2000 years ago. The liberal media 
have a tendency not to sensationalize scandals in Protestantism and they do just 
the reverse for the Catholic Church. They have put the Catholic Church under a 
microscope, looking for any possible aberration which they take great pride in 
blowing all out of proportion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Didn't Jesus say, "
    <font color="#800000">
     Let 
him who is without sin cast the first stone...
    </font>
    <font color="#000000">
     "?
     <br/>
     John 8:7
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </font>
    3. From the figures I have listed 
above, the great majority of Catholic priests who are not part of this scandal, 
are looked upon as guilty until proven innocent, instead of the other way around 
as it is in the secular world. What kind of compassion for the great majority of 
innocent priests is espoused by the liberal media, and by those individual 
non-Catholics who enjoy attacking the Catholic Church?
    <br/>
    It appears that all 
Catholic priests are being treated with suspicion. Is that being 
Christ-like?
    <br/>
    Is this fair to the innocent who are the vast 
majority?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4. Do we condemn all executives of large corporations because 
of the alleged actions of those of a few? Do we condemn all of Islam because of 
the actions of some militants?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    5. Do we condemn Peter because of 
Judas?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    6. Jesus Himself sat at table with sinners. That is a sign that 
all are welcome to His table.
    <br/>
    "And as he sat at table in the house, behold, 
many tax collectors and came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when 
the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat 
with tax collectors and sinners?" But when he heard it, he said, "Those who are 
well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this 
means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the 
righteous, but sinners."
    <br/>
    Matthew 9:10-13
    <br/>
    The Catholic Church is, and has 
always been a hospital for sinners, and not a hotel for saints (Mark 2:17). The
    <a href="visible.htm">
     visible
    </a>
    Catholic Church is 
populated by fallible human beings, and
    <a href="all.htm">
     all
    </a>
    have sinned.
    <br/>
    Romans 3:23,5:12.
    <br/>
    Didn't 
Saint John say, "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His 
word is not in us"?
    <br/>
    1John 1:10
    <br/>
    The purpose of the Catholic Church is to 
make saints in heaven out of sinners on earth.
    <br/>
    Contrast that with some 
Protestant sects who claim, "
    <a href="saved.htm">
     once 
saved always saved
    </a>
    ". That statement really means, "we can sin as much as we 
want because we are already saved". If anyone claims that they are
    <a href="saved.htm">
     saved
    </a>
    in this life, aren't they 
really proclaiming themselves as being saints already?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    7. Those who 
relish attacking the Catholic Church are guilty of all of the

     So why are there so many scandals in the Catholic Church?
     <br/>
    </font>
    Simply 
because Holy Scripture tells us that there will be scandals within the only 
Church which Jesus Christ founded. If there were no scandals, then Holy 
Scripture would be in error, would it not? So how can anyone become upset when 
scandals do arise within the Church?

Jesus Christ is the first of the lines following, and to His Body, the Catholic

      <br/>
      <br/>
      They rebelled against His Authority.
      <br/>
      They 
rebel against its Authority. 2Peter 2:10
      <br/>
      <br/>
      They said Crucify Him, Matthew 
27:23.
      <br/>
      Heretics have been trying to crucify it for 2000 years.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He is 
called Beelzebub, Matthew 10:25.
      <br/>
      They call it the Church of Satan.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      They said he is a false messiah, Luke 22:70-71.
      <br/>
      They say it is a 
false church.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He called Himself the Son of GOD.
      <br/>
      It claims it was 
founded by GOD, Matthew 16:18.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He called Himself Truth, John 14:6.
      <br/>
      It 
claims to be infallible, 1Timothy 3:15.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He called Himself King, John 
18:37.
      <br/>
      It says it is the only true Church, Matthew 16:18.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He could not 
sin.
      <br/>
      It has no spot or wrinkle, Ephesians 5:27.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He was not believed by 
many, Luke 22:67.
      <br/>
      It is not believed by many.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He was denied by many, 
Luke 22:57-60.
      <br/>
      It is denied by many.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He was derided, not being 
understood.
      <br/>
      It is derided, not being understood, 2Peter 2:12.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Not 
understanding Him, they walked away, John 6:66.
      <br/>
      Not understanding it, they 
walked away.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He had many false accusers, Mark 14:56-59.
      <br/>
      It has many 
false accusers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He was mocked, Luke 23:35-37.
      <br/>
      It is mocked.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He 
was scandalized, Luke 17:1-2.
      <br/>
      It is scandalized.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He was hated without 
a cause, John 15:18-25.
      <br/>
      It is hated without a cause.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His accuser, 
Judas, died, Matthew 27:5.
      <br/>
      Its accusers die, but still, the Church lives on 
to bury its accusers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His enemies would stumble and fall, John 
18:6.
      <br/>
      Its enemies stumble and fall.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We have no king but Caesar, John 
19:15.
      <br/>
      We have no need of it, as we have the Bible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Can anything good 
come out of Nazareth? John 1:46.
      <br/>
      Can anything good come from Rome?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      They cried out, "Not this one but Barabbas", John 15:18-25.
      <br/>
      It is 
also rejected by the world.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He bore His Cross, John 19:17.
      <br/>
      It bears a 
cross also, the cross of persecution for almost 2000 years.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He died on 
the Cross, John 19:30.
      <br/>
      It has thousands of martyrs, many on crosses.

the same passion as He did. He was persecuted and calumnized unjustly, and so 
must His Church suffer the same trials.
      <br/>
      The persecutors and calumnizers 
should realize that when they attack the Catholic Church, they are really 
attacking its founder, Jesus Christ Himself.
      <br/>
      In rejecting His Church, they 
are in fact, rejecting Him.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "So now I say to you, keep away from these 
men and let them alone. For if this plan or work, is of men, it will be 
overthrown;
      <u>
       but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it
      </u>
      .
      <u>
       Else perhaps you may find yourselves fighting even against God
      </u>
      ."
      <br/>
      Acts 
5:38-39
      <br/>
      If only the attackers and detractors of the Catholic Church would 
stop ignoring these verses and heed the very important message they present. 
They might then notice that no man-made institution could possibly have lasted 
for 2000 years, while at the same time having to endure the unending attacks of 
constant slings and arrows from countless heretics and from all quarters.
      <br/>
      Now 
you please tell me, just who is protecting the Catholic Church?
      <br/>
