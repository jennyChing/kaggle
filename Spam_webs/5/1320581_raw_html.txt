          Norm Goldblatt performs at nightclubs, comedy clubs, corporate events, private parties and fundraisers.  His humor touches on technology, science, politics, and the human condition.  Every show is different and peppered with jokes from the days news.  His quips were quoted regularly by the late great Herb Caen in the San Francisco Chronicle and his jokes are heard on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  Born with Asociotechnophilia, he redirected the ravaging effects of this disease toward developing skills as a physicist, teacher, engineer and entertainer.  He has 2 head positions  towards the stars and towards his shoes  but get him onstage and power him with a spotlight, and his laser gaze will entrance you.

       Pollution of many types and kinds is currently
              paramount in the public mind. Causes and solutions
              are being loudly proclaimed by all of the media,
              politicians, public agencies, universities, garden
              clubs, industry, and churches, ad infinitum.
              Pollution runs the spectrum from the air we breathe
              and the water we drink to the soil we till, as well
              as visual and audio pollution, and in recent years,
              pollution of outer space from junk exploration
              hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
       These threats to our environment, our health and
              our mental wellbeing are real and with us, but not
              nearly as immediately catastrophic or totally
              destructive as the disaster which imminently faces
              this nation and menace of monstrous proportions can
              be likened only to the entire country resting on a
              gargantuan San Andreas fault. Earthquakes, hurricanes,
              mud slides, fire, famine, and atomic war all rolled
              into one hold no greater destructive power than this
              incipient horror which will engulf the country in the
              immediate and predictable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       This continent is in the gravest danger of following
              legendary Atlantis to the bottom of the sea. No
              natural disaster, no overpowering compounding of
              pollutions or cataclysmic nuclear war will cause the
              end.  Instead, a seemingly innocent monster created
              by man, nurtured by man, however as yet unheeded by
              man, will doom this continent to the watery grave of
              oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is yet time to save ourselves if this
              warning is heeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE
       <i>
        NATIONAL
              GEOGRAPHIC
       </i>
       MAGAZINE MUST BE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED
              AT ALL COSTS! This beautiful, educational, erudite,
              and thoroughly appreciated publication is the
              heretofore unrecognized instrument of doom which must
              be erased if we as a country or continent will
              survive. It is NOT TOO LATE if this warning is heeded!
      </p>
      <p>
       According to current subscription figures, more than
              6,869,797 issues of the
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       magazine are sent to subscribers monthly throughout
              the world. However, it would be safe to say that the
              bulk of these magazines reach subscribers in the
              United States and Canada, and it is, and never has
              been, thrown away! It is saved like a monthly edition
              of the Bible. The magazine has been published for over
              141 years continuously, and countless millions if not
              billions of copies have been innocently yet
              relentlessly accumulating in basements, attics,
              garages, public and private institutions of learning,
              the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution,
              Good Will, and Salvation Army stores, and heaven
              knows where else. Never discarded, always saved. No
              recycling, just the horrible and relentless
              accumulation of this static vehicle of our doom!
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       averages approximately
              2 pounds per issue. Since no copies have been
              discarded or destroyed since the beginning of
              publication, it can be readily seen that the
              accumulated aggregate weight is a figure that not only
              boggles the mind, but is imminently approaching the
              disaster point. That point will be the time at which
              the geologic substructure of the country can no longer
              support the incredible load, and subsidence will occur.
              Gradually at first, but then relentlessly accelerating
              as rock formations are compressed, become plastic and
              begin to flow, great faults will appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical sequence of events is predictable. First
              will come foundation failures and gradual sinking of
              residences and public buildings in which the magazine
              has been stored. As these areas depress the earth,
              more and more structures will topple and sink until
              whole towns and cities will submerge, then larger and
              larger land masses. This chain reaction will
              accelerate until the entire country has fallen below
              the level of the sea and total inundation will occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The areas of higher subscription density, affluence
              and wealth, will be the first to go, followed by
              institutions, middle class, urban, and ghetto areas
              in that order, with the relatively unpopulated plains
              and mountains finally sinking into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been warned of this impending calamity by a
              seeming increase in so-called natural disasters
              throughout the country, as well as isolated
              occurrences striking areas heretofore immune to
              natural destruction:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Increase in earthquake activity in California
                has been triggered by population growth and the
                subsequent increase in
        <i>
         National Geographic
        </i>
        subscriptions and accumulations of heavy masses of
                the magazine. This gradual increase in weight has
                caused increased activity along the San Andreas fault.
       </li>
       <li>
        Earthquakes in the Denver area were not caused
                by pumping of wastes into wells at the Rocky Mountain
                Arsenal, but by accumulation of
        <i>
         National
                  Geographic
        </i>
        magazines by more and more people as
                the population increased over the years.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sinking of several coal-mining towns throughout
                the country can only be attributed to the increase in
                workers benefits and pay increases, allowing them to
                subscribe to and hoard
        <i>
         National Geographic
        </i>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        Mud slides in California, which have brought
                destruction to hundreds of homes built on the
                hillsides, were triggered by the final straw in the
                form of the last delivery into these areas of
        <i>
         National Geographic
        </i>
        to subscribers and hoarders.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The list is endless. The warnings are clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time grows short and we must act at once if this
              calamity is to be averted. The
       <i>
        National
                Geographic
       </i>
       must cease publication at once, if
              necessary by Congressional action or Presidential
              edict.

       An attack on

        National Geographic
       </i>
       magazine is
              an attack on a venerated American tradition, one as

      </p>
      <p>
       The cry for the immediate termination of publication
              and distribution of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       magazine cannot go without challenge. Kaub (1974)
              has not only created an aura of hysteria for the
              future of the Earth, but has also imparted an
              unnecessary sense of guilt on anyone who as much as
              reads an issue of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       , let
              alone anyone who would sequester an issue in an attic
              or garage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kaub (1974) contends there will be disasters of
              continental proportions due to the indestructiveness
              of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       magazine. He suggests
              that localized accumulations of
       <i>
        National
                Geographic
       </i>
       are responsible for earthquake
              activity in areas such as the San Andreas fault and
              Denver. He also would attribute directly to the
              magazine other natural disasters such as mud slides
              and subsidence. Kaub (1974) further knells the
              doomsday bell, by predicting that continued storage
              of the magazine will result in massive subsidence of
              buildings, cities, and finally, inundation of the
              entire country by sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is such erroneous expoundings as Kaub's that have
              created undue panic among the populace on other
              occasions. For example, movement along the San Andreas
              fault has been interpreted to mean that California
              will soon fall into the sea!
      </p>
      <p>
       And now
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       ! Is nothing sacred?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's examine this problem calmly and logically.
              First, 10 issues of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       magazine were selected from the collections of the
              author and a colleague. These issues were weighed and
              measured; these data are given in Table 1, in addition
              to calculated values of area and density for the
              magazine.

       To simplify the following calculations, it was assumed
              that erosion of the landmass is negligible, as well as
              other geologic factors. The only geologic process that
              would be operative is isostasy, which is the approach
              of crustal masses to a flotational equilibrium. Other

       Taking the predictions of Kaub (1974) at face value,
              the height of a column of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       magazines necessary to depress the continental land
              mass by 100 feet (30.48 m) was calculated. This would
              be a vertical stack 82.33 m high, equivalent to 11.45
              x 10
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       magazines. This depression of the
              land mass would produce a rise in sea level due to
              displaced mantle material. Assuming the effect is
              confined only to the ocean basins, a net depression
              of 100 feet (30.48 m) would be due to an actual
              depression of the land of 29.82 m and a resultant
              rise in sea level of 66 cm.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be a notable change in the coastline with
              a net depression of 100 feet. While there will be
              little change in the outline of the West coast due to
              the steep slope, that of the East coast will change
              markedly. It is readily seen that many urban problems
              will be solved by inundation, saving vast amounts of
              urban renewal funds. The Atlantis legend will be
              recalled with the flooding of cities such as Boston,
              New York, Washington, Baltimore, Savannah, Miami,
              Houston, and New Orleans. Of course, unexpected
              benefits would be realized by other communities.
              For example, Yazoo, Mississippi, would become a major
              seaport - certainly a possibility that has not been
              dreamed of by town officials, even in their wildest
              imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how beneficial the results of this crustal
              depressing might be, there is the question of time.
              Assuming even distribution of
       <i>
        National
                Geographic
       </i>
       over the present surface, it would
              take 17.94 x 10
       <sup>
        13
       </sup>
       copies of the magazine
              to cover the 48 United States with one thickness.
              If the National Geographic Society continues to
              publish the magazine at 12 issues each year, it will
              take 2.176 x 10
       <sup>
        6
       </sup>
       years to deposit one
              thickness over the United States. The time it would
              take to accumulate a thickness of
       <i>
        National
                Geographic
       </i>
       sufficient to depress the crust 100
              feet would be 24.92 x 10
       <sup>
        9
       </sup>
       years. Since
              this length of time is several times greater than the
              present age of the Earth, it should be obvious that we
              or future generations have little to fear from the
              National Geographic Society.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Mr. Kaub is still distressed about the weighty
              threat by the National Geographic Society, perhaps
              he should consider taking up lighter reading.

       Dear Editor:
      </p>
      <p>
       It was with mixed feelings that I pondered George
              H. Kaub's "
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       , the Doomsday
              Machine" in
       <i>
        JIR
       </i>
       , since similar thoughts had
              passed through my mind on occasion. Especially
              hitting close to home was the discovery, in a previous
              home, that my living room putting practice was quite
              sour, due to tilt of the house because of
              unsymmetrical attic storage (hoarding, if you insist,
              Mr. Kaub) of my copies of
       <i>
        Life
       </i>
       Magazine over a
              mere 35 years; the earth below, as well as my spirits,
              definitely suffered depression.  However, it would have
              been unseemly of my scientific mind to extrapolate so
              local an incident to a global catastrophe after once
              having been caught in an error of judgement on a much
              grander scale, namely the State of Texas.
      </p>
      <p>
       A compatriot in my Army outfit it was, who put me in
              my place. He was a short-statured Texan who, I had
              earlier thought, was also short in cranial content.
              But, like so many Texans who engage in hyperbole in
              all matters dealing with that state, this one bragged
              about the fact that Texas rests on a sea of oil, whose
              enormous monetary value supports all the affluence
              attending not only the medical profession, but even
              the lowliest gandy-dancer in that state. I retorted
              with exaggerated smugness that his privileges were to
              be short-lived because, as that wealth of oil is
              withdrawn from beneath his great state of Texas, his
              great state is going to sink out of sight and mind.
              But imagine my chagrin for having overlooked the
              well-documented answer when, some days later, he
              accosted me with a victorious air and declared,
              "Your prediction is impossible. I looked it up and
              found that the oil is pushed out of the ground by
              brine which is pumped into the ground. Therefore,
              no void is created and Texas won't sink". Thus, I
              must raise the point that George Kaub is alarming us
              unduly, despite the apparent legitimacy of his thesis.
              There must be a compensating factor which is not
              obvious at the moment.

       Kaub's excellent article was the first organized
              warning of imminent disaster. Unfortunately Jones's
              recent response to this is quite erroneous and dilutes
              the efficacy of the alert. The same issue of
       <i>
        JIR
       </i>
       contains a letter by Koosman which reports
              a directly validating experience of Kaub's hypothesis,
              but then goes on to deny the generalizability of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow me to dispose of Koosman's ready acceptance of
              his Texan's explanation first. Texas will sink (sic)
              and is in fact sinking (sic) at present. The reason
              for this has nothing to do with the accumulation of
              the magazine Kaub described as beautiful, educational
              and erudite, since these qualities usually are not
              considered in relation to oil in Texas. While it is
              true that the oil that is being pumped out of the
              ground is replaced by the brine pushing it out, this
              will not save Texas.  Everyone knows that oil floats
              on water, even salt water. (Remember the oil-soaked
              gulls and other birds after oil-spills?) This means
              that the light oil that Texas is floating on is being
              replaced by brine. This heavier brine will compress
              the material under it and sink deeper into the Earth.
       <i>
        Quod erat demonstrandum,
       </i>
       Texas will continue to
              sink (sic).
      </p>
      <p>
       Return to Jones's whitewash of the impending
              catastrophe. He makes 8 assumptions in arriving at
              his conclusion that it will require 24.92 x 10
       <sup>
        9
       </sup>
       years
              to depress the crust of the United States 100 feet.
              Of these 8 assumptions, 2 are completely incorrect
              and 3 are irrelevant (numbers 1, 3, and 6). The 2
              crucial, incorrect assumptions are numbers 2 and 4.
              Number 2 assumes that the monthly circulation of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       will remain constant.
              Since the population of the United States and
              especially the population of children in the USA is
              increasing, it is clear that the monthly circulation
              of
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       will also increase since
              the magazine is subscribed to mainly for school
              children.  (The initial subscription is taken out with
              the intent of allowing the child to cut up the
              magazine. However, the beauty of each issue is such
              that parents never permit such sacrilege.) Thus, since
              the population of the United States is increasing, the
              monthly circulation of the magazine will also
              increase. This is a lower-bound estimate since both
              standard of living and degree of pretentiousness have
              been increasing at a more rapid rate than the
              population of the United States. This pretentiousness
              is an important motivating factor in subscribing to
       <i>
        National Geographic
       </i>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The other critical assumption, namely number 4, that
              the magazine is evenly distributed over the 48 states,
              is false. In truth, the 23 states comprising the
              Eastern one-fourth of the country in land area (in
              fact 23.8%) contain more than half (56.4%) of the
              population. Thus, it is clear that more than 50% of
              the density of the increasing numbers of the magazine
              is accumulating in less than one-fourth of the land
              mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       These figures necessitate a re-computation of the
              ultimate effect of accumulation of
       <i>
        National
                Geographic
       </i>
       magazines. The most likely result,
              taking account of the increasing population density
              of the West Coast as well, is that subsidence will
              occur at both the East and West coastal ends of the
              United States. The probability is that both coasts
              will sink, and the West Central portion of the United
              States (except Texas, as noted above) will rise an
              average of 217 meters.  And, Jones to the contrary,
              this will take place in much less than 24.92 x
              10
       <sup>
        9
       </sup>
       years. It will occur in 457.247 x
              3
       <sup>
        7
       </sup>
       years! Clearly Kaub's warning must be
              heeded if we are to avoid disaster.
