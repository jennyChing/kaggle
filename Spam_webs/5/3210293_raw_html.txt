      Salvia divinorum
     </span>
     extract at home, and wondered why it looks like a black sticky mess thats harsher on your throat than a porcupine-eating competition?
    </span>
    Well, fear not, for this guide will ensure a quality finished product, rivalling that of store-bought extracts, using readily available chemicals, everyday kitchen equipment and a few other cheap bits &amp; pieces.
   </p>
   <p>
    This procedure will take several days from start to finish, but only requires a couple of hours of actual work.

     <span class="dyn-leaf-remaining">

     <span class="italic">
      Salvia

     leaf. Its worth pointing out that although the leaves may not instantly grind, youll have to give them a few minutes, but they WILL powder eventually.

     <p>
      Dried
      <span class="italic">
       Salvia
      </span>
      leaf naturally crumbles, so you will likely have whole leaves and stems at the top of your pile, while the bits that crumble off will work their way to the bottom of your stash. Crush the leaves in your hands first to create more crumbs! You may find the stems and other lighter bits of leaf easier to grind by putting a big pinch of stems in your grinder first and then taking some crumbly bits and putting them on top the stems in the grinder. This makes sure the stems come into better contact with the blades and speeds the process up.

    <h3>
     Step 2 - Dissolve The Salvinorin-A
    </h3>
    <div class="summary bg2">
     <p>
      Wash the powdered leaf with plenty of acetone for five minutes, filter and repeat.
      <br/>
      Keep the acetone, discard the leaf. Allow the acetone to stand for 24 hours in the dark.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     Now, we need to get all the Salvinorin-A out of your powdered leaf. Luckily for us, Salvinorin-A is readily soluble in acetone (approximately 23mg/ml)! Place your powdered leaf in a container (Ive used a 600ml glass beaker, but a clean glass jar or similar will do nicely) and pour on enough acetone to cover it. Make sure to stir the gloopy mixture and add more acetone until all of the powdered leaf material is soaked. Leave this to stand for five minutes.
     <span id="dyn-step2-beakers">
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The liquid is the part were interested in, so we need to filter this mixture to separate the acetone from the leaf. The easiest way to do this is to place a cloth over another container and empty the contents of the first container into it. Gather up the cloth and give it a squeeze to get most of the excess acetone out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Put the container with the acetone in to one side for now, then put the powdered leaf back into the original container and repeat the process to get as much Salvinorin-A out of the
     <span class="italic">
      Salvia
     </span>
     leaf as possible. You can now throw away the damp powdered leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
     As you can see from the pictures below, the acetone also contains a lot of small particles that we don't want in the finished thing. These are small particles of leaf and tannins that went straight through the filter. These are difficult to remove later on and if we ignore them, we will end up with a worse quality extract as a result. The best way to get rid of them is to let your acetone sit for 24 hours in a dark room so all the particles settle at the bottom. (Salvinorin-A in solution can be destroyed by light, so it is important to keep your container in the dark while everything settles out!)

     This step is nice and straightforward. Carefully pour the acetone into a flat glass tray, being careful not to disturb the sediment. This should now be left in a dark room (remember, Salvinorin-A in solution is sensitive to light) until it has fully evaporated.

      You can gently help the evaporation process by placing a fan nearby. A gentle breeze provided by two fans taken from an old computer evaporated all the acetone in about four hours

      . Here are a couple of pictures showing the fans screwed onto a block of wood, wired in parallel via a terminal block and powered with a 12V 1A DC adaptor:

      <strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      Acetone is flammable so you should NOT use a heat source (eg a hair dryer) to aid evaporation! Use a simple fan, or nothing at all.

    <p>
     Your acetone will always contain a percentage or two of water. While the acetone will evaporate off easily, the water will remain for some time. You can either wait until the water evaporates of pour off the water and discard it. When the green contents of your shallow dish are totally dry, scrape up as much as you can with a razor blade or similar, ready for Step 4. This is your extracted Salvinorin-A and other plant waxes.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is as far as most people get with their extractions and is the reason why the end result is a black sticky mess. Thats fine if youre making a weak extract, but if youre making anything stronger than 5x, it becomes unsmokable and you will need to purify it further.

    <h3>
     Step 4 - Purify The Salvinorin-A
    </h3>
    <div class="summary bg4">
     <p>
      Wash the green Salvinorin-A repeatedly with naphtha.
      <br/>
      Pour off the final wash and allow any remaining naphtha to evaporate completely.
     </p>
    </div>
    <p>
     Acetone is a powerful solvent; as well as Salvinorin-A, it also dissolves a tonne of waxy stuff from the leaves that we don't want. In order to purify the Salvinorin-A, we will need to use another solvent: one that can dissolve plant waxes easily but leave the Salvinorin-A behind  this is where our lighter fluid comes in! Lighter fluid is basically naphtha (petroleum ether), a great nonpolar solvent that can dissolve nonpolar waxes with ease, while our polar Salvinorin-A molecules remain untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Begin this step by placing your waxy Salvinorin-A scrapings into a tall, narrow container (using a test tube makes this a lot easier). Fill this container with lighter fluid and shake or stir it for a few seconds. The naphtha will immediately take on the dark green/red colour (depending on the light) that the acetone had previously as the waxes are dissolved. Within minutes, a sediment of Salvinorin-A particles will form on the bottom of your container.
    </p>
    <p>
     After several hours, most of the Salvinorin-A will have made it to the bottom of your container. Pipette off most of the liquid, being careful not to disturb the sediment. Save the liquid in a larger container (it will still contain some Salvinorin-A that we will reclaim later) and repeat the process by adding fresh naphtha to the first container.
    </p>
    <p>
     This washing process should be repeated at least five times to make a high quality
     <span class="italic">
      Salvia
     </span>
     extract. After five washes, the sediment will still be green even though npure Salvinorin-A is white. If you continue this washing process further, you will end up with white Salvinorin-A, however this is not required  you can tell by the colour of the naphtha after each wash that a lot of waxy gunk has already been removed.

    <p>
     After the final wash has settled, remove most of the naphtha from both containers and dispose of it. You will now be left with relatively pure Salvinorin-A in both tubes with a little liquid left on top. Add a little clean naphtha to both containers, shake them up and pour them both into a wider third container. Rinse out the previous container with more naphtha if anything is left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The remaining naphtha needs to be completely evaporated. You can either let it stand for several hours and let the naphtha evaporate naturally or use a fan to assist. I used the same fan setup from Step 3 (figures 15 and 16) and this only took 90 minutes. Again, do NOT use heat to evaporate the naphtha  lighter fluid, is, well	... flammable!

     </span>
     x the amount of Salvinorin-A compared to dried leaf alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Take your container of dried Salvinorin-A and add just enough acetone to dissolve everything. You dont need much! Stir the contents of your container to make sure everything is dissolved, then use a pipette to deposite the green liquid onto your
     <span class="italic">
      Salvia
     </span>
     leaf, a few drops at a time. Every time you empty a pipette onto the leaf, give it a good mix to make sure the liquid covers the leaf material uniformly. Repeat until all the Salvinorin-A acetone solution is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     You will probably find that the container that previously held the liquid is still rather green  rather than let this go to waste, add a little bit more clean acetone to it, then pipette this onto your leaf as before.

     Now you simply leave this in the dark for the acetone to completely evaporate, leaving behind a beautiful, high quality

     A tincture is simply a solution of something in alcohol (ethanol). So, all you need to do to create your own
     <span class="italic">
      Salvia divinorum
     </span>
     tincture is to make a saturated Salvinorin-A ethanol solution. Here's roughly how it's done:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Follow the above procedure up until Step 4, then wash the Salvinorin-A with more and more naphtha until the sediment after each wash begins to turn white, then allow the naphtha to evaporate completely.
     </li>
     <li>
      Warm up the highest concentration of ethanol you can get your hands on in a water bath.
     </li>
     <li>
      Pour a tiny amount of ethanol into another container (also in the water bath) and add all of your Salvinorin-A.
     </li>
     <li>
      Give it a few minutes to disolve as much as it can, shaking or stirring occasionally.
     </li>
     <li>
      When no more Salvinorin-A will disolve, add more warm ethanol a few ml at a time. Eventually, you will have added enough warm ethanol to disolve all of your Salvinorin-A.
     </li>
     <li>
      Take your solution out of the water bath and allow to cool
