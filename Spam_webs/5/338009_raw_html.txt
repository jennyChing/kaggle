         Bred for looks, not health, many purebred dogs are drawn from a genetic wading pool that might have been designed by a cabal of Ralph Lauren, Dr. Frankenstein, Walt Disney and David Koch.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even socially aware consumers who sneer at $5,000 designer purses, and animal defenders who deplore the cruelties of commercial livestock production, buy into trendy canines. Purebreds are commodities like any other luxury good, and breeding them is big business. Registered golden retrievers go for up to $3,000, English bulldogs for $9,000, and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel can cost $14,000, almost as much as a Honda Fit.
        </p>
        <p>
         But neither price, pedigree nor being loved like a member of the family can shield a dog from the pain, breathing difficulties, cancer, panoply of debilitating genetic disorders, mental illness, crippling physiognomy and shortened life span that disproportionately plague purebreds.
        </p>
        <p>
         The main U.S. arbiter of canine purity is the American Kennel Club. The first goal of its mission is upholding the integrity of its Registry. Pedigree, the AKC asserts, creates a level of breed predictability of temperament and physical characteristics. But the AKC is also a lead profiteer in an industry that Michael Brandow, author of A Matter of Breeding, decried as a kind of long-term, institutionalized cruelty that makes vivisection look humane.
        </p>
        <p>
         The demand for ever-more-perfect purebred dogs has concentrated bad recessive genes and turned many pets into medical nightmares, Consumer Reports warned. Inbreeding for clonelike consistency ensures that genes for disease and deformity piggyback on those for a lush coat, appealing nose, witty wrinkles, quirky gait or endearingly protuberant eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
         And often the deformity itselflike the crippling slope of German shepherds hindquartersis the desired, indeed required, trait. In bulldogs, a liver colored nose is a deal breaker by AKC show standards, and a brachycephalic face that impairs breathing is essential. Both traits, however, can hasten death one from breeders culling of irregular specimens, the other from disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike some of its European counterparts, the AKC opposes mandatory genetic screening that weeds out heritable diseases. It rejects accepting healthier conformations or expanding the gene pool by outbreeding with non-registered dogs. Producers who want high-value animals eligible for competition must accede to insanely capricious, detailed and dangerous AKC standards set by its breed clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Breeders are abetted by consumers, whoseeking fashion, predictability or the doppelganger of a beloved lost petdisassociate breed flaws from their own cherished pet. Then, when faced with high vet bills for dogs that are disabled, ill or willfully deformed, they often offload the dogs within a year to shelters, where purebreds constitute 25 percent of canines.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AKC keeps its registration fees. And they add up: The clubs 990 tax form for 2013 reported $60 million in total revenue, with more than half$32 millionfrom registrations. Judging and pedigree dog shows (the AKC claims 3.2 million entries from 190 approved breeds), like Westminster, generated $12.6 million. The AKC allocated 1 percent of its revenue to its Canine Health Foundation. CEO Dennis Sprungs 2013 compensation topped $567,000, while the clubs nine other top officers garnered $20.3 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the club gets rich, the AKC abets or essentially mandates the genetic impoverishment of dogs through inbreeding, overbreeding and bizarre standards of beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Humane Society estimates that some 10,000 mass breeding operations churn out 1 million pups a year, many in industrial-scale puppy mills that supply pet stores and online consumers. At some large-scale commercial breeders, a term the AKC prefers, hundreds of studs and dams are tightly caged in dreadful conditions and killed when they can no longer produce. Puppies with minor deviations become cosmetic culls.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the genetic legacy of those that make the grade can be a ticking time bomb. Pugs and bulldog breeds, which the AKC labels generally healthy, have smushed-up faces whose neoteny prompts the affection due babies, albeit really ugly ones. Some pugs can neither mate nor give birth without human help. A good whack to the back of the head has been known to pop their adorably bulging eyes out of their heads. We wont delve into the problem of plugged anal glands, but the owner will have to.
        </p>
        <p>
         On average, purebreds live two years less than mutts. AKC-conforming Cavalier King Charles spaniels are subject to seizures and persistent, excruciating pain from syringomyelia, caused by desirably deformed skulls too small for their brains. American pit bulls, Staffordshires, rottweilers, akitas and malamutes are unusually likely to be involved in fatal biting incidents. Some 60 percent of sweet, loyal golden retrievers, also an AKC healthy breed, die from cancer. Beagles tend to epilepsy, Dobermans to obsessive compulsive disorder, and wrinkly-faced boxers and shar-peis to skin and eye problems. Labradors, the AKCs most popular breed for 24 years, are prone to about 30 inherited conditions. None of these problems disqualify a dog from AKC registration, or even winning best in show.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AKC imposes its standards on legislation as well as dogs. Defending owners rights and breed integrity, the club tracks hundreds of state and federal bills. It opposes limiting the number of litters per year, banning surgical debarking, mandatory spay/neuter programs at shelters, and required inspections and regulation at puppy mills and commercial facilities to set and enforce minimal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The club furthers this agenda through various mechanisms. Its AKC PAC help[s] elect dog-friendly leadership in Congress and state houses across the nation and claims victory for 90 percent of candidates it supported in 2012. The clubs Canine Legislative Support Fund educate[s] [i.e., lobbies] officials on a federal, state and local level. AKC-sponsored legislative empowerment seminars teach breeders, owners and others involved in commerce involving dogs how to oppose legislation and regulations, according to SourceWatch.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite all this effort to influence politicians and legislation, the AKCs 2012 and 2013 tax filings list no lobbying expenses. By tracking Congressional filings, OpenSecrets.org found that the AKC employs several high-powered firms for lobbying, including Barnes and Thornburg, which it has paid exactly $100,000 annually since 2013a penny below the more-than-$100,000 threshold triggering disclosure on a 990.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to SourceWatch, the AKC works through front groups, including the National Animal Interest Alliance, a lobbying organization. The owners rights that NAIA supports include ear cropping, tail docking, and debarking of dogs, and [declawing] cats. Its director, Patti Strand, fit right in as a headline speaker at the AKCs 2012 Legislative Conference.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another group associated with the AKC is Berman and Company. Its creations, HumaneWatch.org and the Center for Consumer Freedom, launched expensive and extensive campaigns against the Humane Society. In 2014, Berman senior vice president Sarah Longwell taught attendees at the AKCs 2014 Legislative Conference how to counter animal protection advocates.
        </p>
        <p>
         A maze of connections and reporting loopholes makes it hard to pin down financial arrangements, if any, between Bermans groups and the AKC. Uncontested, though, is their shared agenda: opposition to limiting breeders rights and antipathy to the Humane Society.
        </p>
        <p>
         Berman is a master at dressing up front groups to look like legitimate nonprofits and using them to serve the interests of his clients, says Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics. He funds these groups through large, anonymous contributions, and his firm turns a nice profit off the groups activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perfecting dog breeds is largely a legacy of a 19th century Victorian fascination with eugenics and racial superiority (a science later embraced by the Nazis). British toffs, transfixed by their own status and breeding, employed pseudoscience to transfer their snobbery to their dogstransforming them from utilitarian hunters, herders and lap lovelies into reflections of taste and wealth.
        </p>
        <p>
         One prominent British show judge, Freeman Lloyd, justified inbreeding because it took the best to get the best. He cautioned in 1924 against imperfect springer spaniels whose  long pedigrees appear well on paper, but whose appearances proclaim a nigger in a woodpile. 
        </p>
        <p>
         The AKC would surely reject that language, but codifies the mindset. The club says of its dog show criteria: Overall appearance and structure is an indication of the dogs ability to produce quality purebred puppies, and that is what is being judged in the ring. Thats why mixed-breeds and spayed or neutered purebreds are not eligible to compete.
        </p>

           Actually, it's 30 percent. The real cruelty, and on a mass scale I find much more alarming than the number of dogs dumped in shelters, is this eagerness to buy animals far more likely on average to be sick and to lead poor-quality lives than dogs with no breeding at all (i.e., mutts). Many breeds, by definition, cannot run, play, or swim like any normal dog should. Across the board, purebreds' vet bills are significantly higher on average than those of non-breeds, and they suffer with their inbred deformities and diseases, constant medical care and repeat surgeries. It only makes sense that breedists, driven by consumer values and treating dogs as luxury items for show, would hold on to their investments rather than cut their losses (by dumping their dogs in shelters: what a waste that would be!).

           I detest PETA with a passion, but there's also something off with modern breeding. Please, look at dogs of the past. There are lots and lots of photos. The pug and the English bulldog did not have such dramatically shoved in faces. The Dachshund was not as elongated. No shepherd, anywhere, could afford a German Shepherd's shortened hind legs, as they were expected to work. Dog breeders and dog shows are breeding these dogs in extreme ways, purely for looks, and it is detrimental to the health of the dogs. I wouldn't want to get rid of the concept of "pedigreed" dogs, but please, get the breeding under control. Get breed standards under control. This is a sick version of a celebrity who gets endless plastic surgeries to fit some ideal of beauty, but this one is permanent. The dog didn't ask for it. The dog's pups didn't ask for it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Part of the problem is, thanks to modern medicine, a dog that can barely breathe well enough to walk down the block can now survive. A dog that must have a c-section to give birth survives the birth, as do her puppies, who will also need c-sections to give birth. That doesn't mean these dogs are healthy and happy.

           Only 20 percent of dogs found in shelters are purebreds.  That does indeed say something about people who own purebred dogs vs. owners of non purebred dogs.

           I applaud the writer of this article, and Michael Brandow the author of A Matter of Breeding for bringing attention to the disturbing truth that so many people buy into deception.  Dogs are a big part of our lives and we are allowing breeders to breed our best friends to death because of our ignorance.  Whats sad is that when anyone tries to educate the masses with facts like Terry &amp; Michael are, they are suddenly branded as hippies or PETA extremist. The obvious question is, whats wrong with consumers making informed decisions based on factual information? This article provides a valuable public service and compels me to want to go out and get Michaels book so I can learn more on how I can obtain a dog that would have a long, healthy life, free of congenital disorders with less veterinary visits and bills. The price of the book would be a small price to pay verses the consequences of buying a dog with serious health issues that may not be seen for months or even years. Be a smart consumer - dont breed or buy while homeless mutts die due to lack of shelter space and not because of poor health issues - ADOPT!!

           Just wondering if inbreeding in humans is not acceptable (brothers and sisters etc reproducing) because of the mentally challenged etc children they would produce why are animals that much different? The problem with animal testing is they keep testing things that are no longer need to be tested. Do we not already know if we put perfume or javex in our eyes the out come will be extreme pain and probably blind us? If we don't I suspect we have more interbreeding in the human race than we suspected.

           You can get a fine dog even from the "popular" breeds such as Golden Retrievers if you do your research and check for reputable breeders. They're out there watching for genetic disorders, choosing sires and dams with care, etc. And anyone who pays more than $1000 for a pup is a sucker. Ours is from the shelter. Best $50 we ever spent.

           53% of all dogs kept as pets in the US are 'mixed breed', so I don't think that dogs in general are endangered by the unsustainable inbreeding of purebred lines. Eventually the breeders will discover that their dogs are so 'pure' that they all have fatal genetic deficiencies, but the rest of our 'mutts' will still be fine. While some rabid animal rights people may find the harm being done to these dogs in the quest for purity to be unbearable, I say let's prioritize and worry about bigger issues, like HUMAN BEINGS being killed or harmed; when we fix that we can move on to improve the quality of animal life.

           Thank you for writing this bold and informative article. A note on the NAIA: the so-called "National Animal Interest Alliance" (whose interest?) is an unholy alliance of industrial farming concerns, circus and rodeo folk, dog breeders, and AKC judges and legislative liaisons who work against puppy mill legislation in courts across the country. You don't have to belong to PETA or be an "extremist" to see that. I myself don't fit either category.

           I think I've seen this article before, maybe a year ago?  It is a re-hash of more PETA propaganda.  Let's face it, PETA has one of the highest kill ratios of any animal association.  If a dog or cat ends up in a PETA run shelter, it's almost an automatic sentence of death.  They don't love animals.
          </p>

           I have a poodle.  Rums is my third.  When the little guy is no longer with me, I'll get another toy poodle.  No one is going to force me to get some half-breed pit-bull, rottweiler mix.  I don't like large dogs. And, yes, I rescued one of those over-bred bichons.  Sadie is a doll.  Today, my sister had to put down her Heinz 57 rescue.  Louis was maybe 12 or so, not living as long as our pure bred poodles.
          </p>
          <p>
           And - I declaw (front only) my cats.  If I did not, they would shred the poodle. It hasn't destroyed their personality.  It hasn't made Baby less destructive.  I've had her for 3 years and her total in breakage of art glass is pushing $3200!  It hasn't stopped Bubbles from helping me write this piece.  Baby is a standard Persian.  She doesn't have a problem with her eyes or breathing.  I have 6 cats.  The only one who hates me with a passion is a rescue who has not been declawed. She is the only one not declawed.

           I'm beginning to think these so-called animal lovers would rather we not have any.

           The problem of inbreeding and extreme conformity in purebred dogs and, increasingly, cats, is still a real one though, even if you (like me) ignore PETA-style extremists. Like--Persians with clogged tear ducts; their tears run down their faces and stain their fur... Little pugs with such short noses that they can't tolerate heat... Responsible breeders have to take these things into account and push for breed standards that support good health. If you love a breed, you don't want to see them die young or be euthanized because their conformation is so extreme that it's harmful to their health. It's just not something an ethical breeder does.

           As a person who recently lost a purebred from a genetic illness, this is the fact that we conveniently ignore.

           Animal welfare is NOT animal rights.  Animal rights is what PETA and HSUS and the ALF are about.  They want NO human-animal interaction at all.

           That's why I don't believe ONE word of these articles because I know animal rights has nothing to do with animals.  It has to do with dictating human behavior.

           I wonder if Ms. Allen has taken a look at dogs of early 1900's perhaps the health status was much worse though it seems she has bent the story toward what was told to her by animal rights activist.  Maybe she should look at the research not only into human medicine but into finding causes for diseases in pets.  Not every child is born without some problem and problems run in families.
           <br/>
           Ms. Allen did not ask AKC about screening when at dog shows for the dogs being shown and for a nominal fee.  Also Ms. Allen has not looked into how the animal rights movement made the jump from England to the USA, back in the late 1890's started with vivisection, since she mentioned this.  This was at first taken up by "church women" mostly in the beginning, mainly due to a lack of trust in physicians and their "scientific" goals of stopping the spread of disease which they thought impossible.  There was an adverson to mixing those vaccination from animals and injecting them into "humans".
           <br/>
           It was not until 1965 that people in the USA heard the term animal rights and that filtered from Brigid Brophy of the UK.  Wake up people, the animal rights agenda has attacked every industry that uses an animal.  I would say it is a movement against humanity.  No food choice, no life saving research, no pets.  What a sad and dangerous world this makes.
