Our ability for higher learning, creative thought, and &ndash; perhaps most importantly &ndash; our sophisticated communication via speech and language, defines us as a superior species. However, as we expand our understanding of how the brain works, and use animal experiments to learn more about the genes involved in intelligence, will we reach a point where we can pull other species onto our intellectual plane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of enhancing animal intelligence may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Consider a study published last month by Ann Graybiel and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about the relationship between intelligence and genes. The team &lt;a href=\"https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/language-gene-0915\"&gt;genetically engineered mice to produce the human form of FOXP2&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; a gene known to be linked to the human brain's capacity to learn and process speech &ndash; to see whether it would improve the rodents&rsquo; ability to learn. Sure enough, when the boosted mice were made to navigate a maze in order to get a reward of chocolate milk, they learned the route faster than the mice without the added human gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are exciting for anyone interested in understanding the genetic changes in our prehistory that helped us become the wise &ndash; or &ldquo;sapient&rdquo; &ndash; ape. But the nature of this study speaks to another question: whether through fundamental alterations and improvements to mouse brains we could create sentient animals with levels of intelligence to rival our own &ndash; a concept known as &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027qh3w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, uplifting has been explored mainly in science fiction. One of this summer's biggest movies was Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which depicts a civilisation of intelligent primates descended from test subjects altered by scientists hoping to find a cure for Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet the movie has parallels with real research now under way. In 2011, a research team led by Sam Deadwyler of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, used &lt;a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/9/5/056012\"&gt;five rhesus monkeys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/9/5/056012\"&gt; to study the factors that lead people with diseases like Alzheimer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/9/5/056012\"&gt;&rsquo;s to lose control of their thought processes&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers trained the monkeys in an intelligence task that involved learning and identifying images and symbols. They were then given doses of cocaine in order to dull their intelligence and made to repeat the test, with predictably less impressive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened in the next stage of the research was remarkable. The same monkeys were fitted with neural prosthetics &ndash; brain implants designed to monitor and correct the functions of the neurons disabled by the cocaine. These implants successfully restored normal brain function to the monkeys when they were drugged &ndash; but crucially, if they were activated before the monkeys had been drugged, they improved the primates&rsquo; performance beyond their original test results. The aim of the experiments was to see whether neural prosthetics could theoretically be used to restore decision-making in humans who have suffered trauma or diseases such as Alzheimer's &ndash; but as far as these specific tests were concerned at least, the brain prosthetics appeared to make the monkeys smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027qhz9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this means we may have already entered the era of animal uplifting, says George Dvorsky of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ieet.org/\"&gt;Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, a think tank that focuses on the implications of future technology. \"But as for more substantive, impactful augmentations, that's still a way off,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The kind of uplift that appears in science fiction will require technologies far more advanced than anything we have today.&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t mean we won&rsquo;t eventually develop these technologies, he adds, particularly as they will primarily help us use animals to learn about cognitive problems in humans, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s an important point: even if the idea of uplifting may seem fantastical &ndash; and not the sort of goal we should be pursuing &ndash; the potential medical benefits in terms of combating human disease and injury suggest further progress down a path that leads to uplifting is inevitable. Certainly such manipulation of animals has advanced enough to become a serious matter to bio-ethicists: in 2011, the Academy of Medical Sciences in the UK reported on the ethics of research involving &lt;a href=\"http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/policy/policy-projects/animals-containing-human-material/\"&gt;animals containing human material&lt;/a&gt;, and devoted an entire section to brain and cognitive manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter has also become a passionate debate for theorists. Some, like Dvorsky, suggest that the debate should be pushed even further, beyond considering just the medical and scientific advances. He believes in an &ldquo;ethical imperative to uplift&rdquo;, arguing that if the technology is developed it should be shared with animals in order to free them from the anguish of 'survival of the fittest' as much as it is to free humans: \"As the stewards of this planet, it is our moral imperative to not just remove ourselves from the Darwinian paradigm, but all the creatures on Earth as well. Our journey to a post-biological, post-Darwinian state will be a mutual one.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027qhzp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For David Brin, a science fiction author whose novels helped popularise the concept of uplifting, the reasons to pursue the idea are slightly more pragmatic. He hopes that newly intelligent species would help us share the responsibility of protecting the environment. \"The oceans of planet Earth are a vast mystery, filled with both physical wealth and unique treasures to preserve,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are trying to learn to be good planetary managers, but I doubt we could fill that role all by ourselves, anywhere near as well as if sapient dolphin partners (and critics) were by our side. The same holds for countless other opportunities for both profit and wisdom.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For others the whole idea is far more problematic. Paul Graham Raven, a researcher at the University of Sheffield, believes the pro-uplifting stance represents biological and scientific arrogance and a misguided belief in human superiority over nature, where human intelligence is viewed as the pinnacle of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the biggest moral dilemma of the whole uplifting debate: even if Dvorsky, Brin, and others believe granting intelligence to other species would be for their benefit, Raven questions whether we possess the moral authority to make that decision for them without their consent. \"It assumes we know what's best for species other than ourselves. Given we show little evidence of knowing what's best for our own species, I'm inclined to mistrust that assumption, however well intended,\" he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":0,"MimeType":"unknown","SourceHeight":0,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8tbz.jpg","SourceWidth":0,"SynopsisLong":"In Depth","SynopsisMedium":"In Depth","SynopsisShort":"In Depth","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8tbz.jpg","Title":"inDepth.jpg","CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8tbz","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8tbz","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p00q8tbz","_id":"559a52de0b808738c4e273fe"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"559a52610b808738c4e262a1"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":116306,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SourceHeight":1080,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/2r/rd/p02rrdlm.jpg","SourceWidth":1920,"SynopsisLong":"(Credit: Getty Images)","SynopsisMedium":"(Credit: Getty Images)","SynopsisShort":"(Credit: Getty Images)","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/2r/rd/p02rrdlm.jpg","Title":"sections_02_science_environment_gettyimages_1920.jpg"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p02rrdlm","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p02rrdlm","_id":"559a55840b808738c4e2defd"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;You do not want to get in the way of a gamma ray burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most luminous, high energy explosions that have happened since the Big Bang,&rdquo; says Neil Gehrels, principal investigator at Nasa for the Swift mission. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a beam of gamma radiation that&rsquo;s flying through the Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if one of these cosmic death rays of high frequency electromagnetic waves hit the Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w94\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;For a planet 1000 light years away, it would destroy the ozone layer. If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasas cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

Her clients come to her with an issue, a question, a mystery, and she figures out the best way to find the answer &ndash; using whatever tools she can. &ldquo;I use a combination of new technology and old technology, because I have to solve a problem. So I&rsquo;ve used everything from geese and dogs to Roombas to drones to GPS.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright is a private investigator &ndash; and owner of the Wright Group &ndash; based in Anaheim, California. She&rsquo;s worked in the business for more than 40 years, and has seen the tools available to investigators change dramatically. Early on, stakeouts in vans were important. More recently new technology in the form of tiny cameras and social media has begun to play a role. And she&rsquo;s embraced those changes. Today, when the problem calls for it, she uses drones to do her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gives me a few examples. If two people are meeting in a public place, a drone can be a helpful way to discreetly watch them. &ldquo;We stay at about 50-75 feet [15-23 metres] above so nothing can be heard.&rdquo; Drones are also helpful for aerial surveillance of locations that are hard to access on foot. And if a school or church is worried someone might be stealing or vandalising property, drones or small off-road vehicles (&ldquo;Roombas on steroids&rdquo; as she calls them) can film the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yhk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Wright was asked to figure out whether or not a soda salesperson was crossing county lines and cheating on his contract. California is one of many states in which salespeople have regional contracts &ndash; for instance, Bob sells Pepsi in Los Angeles County and Nancy sells Pepsi in Orange County. If Nancy arrives at her usual businesses to sell her Pepsi and finds the soda supply has already been topped up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that someone (perhaps Bob) has crossed county lines and sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-tech toys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright was asked to figure out whether this was happening. To do so meant visiting every major soda wholesaler from San Luis Obispo to San Diego &ndash; about 300 miles (480km) of California coast &ndash; and checking whether any were selling soda from the wrong salesperson. When there was illegal soda on sale, she would use a drone to follow the soda delivery trucks back to their depots. In one case, the warehouse the truck led her back to was out in the desert and would have been impossible to approach by car or foot without being noticed. But the drone was able to spy on the trucks covertly. &ldquo;We could see between the warehouse door and the truck loading.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright gets her drones from high-end toy stores, for about $200 each. They&rsquo;re an expensive investment: not only do you have to buy the device, you also have to pay one or two people to pilot and spot the thing. And if you lose one during a mission, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of your budget. But it can be worth it, because for the cases in which they&rsquo;re useful, they can be very useful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yh4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright doesn&rsquo;t pilot the drones herself. &ldquo;I try to hire gamers. I go to the colleges and high schools and I find out who the geeks are, and then I hire them.&rdquo; She said that her pilots are more skilled than she would ever be &ndash; and they like the challenge. Some of them are working towards their own private investigator licences, and their hours piloting the little devices can count as hours towards their certification. (None of Wright&rsquo;s gamer pilots were willing to talk for this article. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re introverts,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Not shy, but introverts.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the idea of using drones to spy on people isn&rsquo;t something everybody is comfortable with. &lt;a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/05/chs-x-files-capitol-hill-drone-pilot-spotted-glowing-orbs-phone-thief-on-wheels/\"&gt;In a case in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a woman reported that someone was using a drone to spy on her. &ldquo;This afternoon, a stranger set an aerial drone into flight over my yard and beside my house near Miller Playfield,&rdquo; she told the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog. &ldquo;I initially mistook its noisy buzzing for a weed-whacker on this warm spring day. After several minutes, I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away.&rdquo; Her husband asked the drone operator, who was standing nearby, to move along &ndash; but the operator claimed to be acting within his legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening regulations&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t always clear. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx\"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 35 states considered adding drone bills to the books last year, and 10 states actually did add new laws. In Iowa, for example, it&rsquo;s now illegal for the state to use drones to enforce traffic laws. In North Carolina, no one can use a drone for surveillance of a person or private property. And Tennessee now specifies that it&rsquo;s a misdemeanour to use drones for surveillance of people who are hunting or fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&rsquo;s drone operations might soon become legally questionable too. Earlier this month, a California senator &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/calif-lawmakers-consider-drone-privacy-bill/31326004\"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would extend property rights into airspace, meaning that drones flying over private property would be considered trespassers. Just a few days before that, President Obama and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/15/a-brief-summary-of-the-faas-new-drone-regulations/\"&gt;announced new drone regulations&lt;/a&gt; as well, requiring &ndash; among other things &ndash; that drones must be under 55lb (25kg) and that operators must keep the flying vehicles in sight at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7xlr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the laws are murky, many private investigators steer clear of drones. &ldquo;The use of drones for surveillance is highly restricted by law,&rdquo; said Kelly Riddle, a private investigator in Texas. &ldquo;There are air space regulations as well as privacy laws that can easily be violated. Obtaining video using a drone has thus far been something that we have been advised is illegal.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because drones are often used to observe activities that can&rsquo;t be seen via a direct line of sight at ground level. Going out of your way to spy on such activities is considered an invasion of privacy, says Riddle. A lot of Wright&rsquo;s work sidesteps this privacy question, because it involves helping schools and churches monitor their own property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the use of drones will be restricted under a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations in the United States sooner than later. But in the meantime Wright will continue to use them when they can help with her work. But she also says that regardless of the legality, if someone thinks their privacy is being compromised, they&rsquo;re going to do something about it.

The pair have been friends since childhood. Within the first year of their friendship, nerve damage inflicted by an inherited genetic condition robbed Haug of his sight and hearing. He was nine. But children are natural innovators. &ldquo;We started to invent languages and forms of communication just because we were kids and we wanted to play,&rdquo; says Schwengber. &ldquo;It was annoying that he couldn't hear me, and I couldn't write something down,&rdquo; she says. So the two invented their own tactile language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Haug and Schwengber grew older, they replaced their private language with one that is more widely understood: Lorm, a tactile alphabet spelled out with strokes to the hand. It was invented in the nineteenth century by Hieronymus Lorm &ndash; an anonymous pseudonym, for Austrian-born poet, journalist, and novelist &lt;a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12762.html\"&gt;Heinrich Landesmann&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; and is still used today by the deaf-blind community in German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv0k9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the importance of Lorm to Haug and Schwengber. But Lorm, and other forms of tactile signing, have their limits. A reliance on physical contact between communicators has historically constrained the social circles of the deaf-blind to those they can meet face-to-face (or more accurately hand-to-hand) on a regular basis &ndash; and even within this relatively small group of people, only those who take the time to learn and practice Lorm can really become part of a deaf-blind individual&rsquo;s social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Haug&rsquo;s social circle currently consists of about five people: his mother, Schwengber, teachers, and therapists. Once a year he spends about 10 days visiting relatives in Stuttgart in Southern Germany. &ldquo;The first five days they need to practice Lorming, so they can remember the letters, and by the tenth day when they are quite fast, it's time to go back home,&rdquo; explains Schwengber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these drawbacks might soon disappear, if a new invention by Tom Bieling is commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactile translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling, a researcher at the Design Lab in Berlin, has developed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.design-research-lab.org/projects/mobile-lorm-glove/\"&gt;glove kitted out with fabric pressure-sensors&lt;/a&gt;. By translating a tactile hand touch alphabet into digital text, the mobile glove could eliminate the necessity of hand-to-hand physical contact for deaf-blind communication. Even better, because a great deal of online communication is text-based, the glove could act as a translating device that allows people who are deaf-blind to communicate freely with anyone &ndash; and for anyone to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an invention reminiscent of the outlandish gadgets seen in James Bond movies, and it won Bieling first prize in the 2014 Falling Walls Lab competition &ndash; a kind of TED Talks meets Dragon&rsquo;s Den &ndash; held annually in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1kq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first prototype was made from Gore-Tex fabric and felt much like an ordinary glove, Bieling explains. It&rsquo;s embedded with small vibrating motors, and &ldquo;as soon as you receive an incoming message, it starts vibrating on those dots where the letters are positioned&rdquo;, he says. In the current version, users can adjust the intensity and speed of the incoming tactile messages according to their reading skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the whole hand area of the glove is now wired for sensory input, &ldquo;just like a tablet [computer]&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The system recognises both the position and pattern of the finger movement.&rdquo; So users can also spell out their own messages.If a sign isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;typed&rdquo; quite correctly, the Lorm glove system recognises the closest symbol &ndash; just like a spell checker on your smart phone. For example, a circle in the hand would be an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, explains Bieling, and even if you type a triangle or a square, the system is clever enough to recognise the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; as the closest correct symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enhancing independence&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking through Schwengber&rsquo;s translation, Haug describes the glove prototype as a bit slower than what he is used to in terms of receiving messages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his teacher or his mother Lorming,&rdquo; says Schwengber, compared with her own speedy pace. &ldquo;But he really likes it,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the glove, &ldquo;I can send and receive &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; says Haug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling&rsquo;s project is part of his doctoral studies exploring links between design and ability. He argues that feeling disabled is a question of design &ndash; a ramp, for instance, is easy for anyone to ascend, even if they are in a wheelchair. He hopes that his design will enable deaf-blind people to engage with a broader spectrum of their community and &ldquo;gain access to a broader range of information, thus enhancing their independence&rdquo;. But he also hopes that gaining knowledge about alternative communication systems can profit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1wv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haug, now 22, currently lives with his mother in Spreewald, about 100km south of Berlin. He is studying massage therapy in the hopes of pursuing it as a profession. He would like to move to Berlin, explains Schwengber, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that has thus far eluded him because of the lack of assistance available. The glove could expand Haug&rsquo;s ability to stay in close touch with those closest to him while living at a distance. But it could do more than that: it could allow him to expand his currently small social circle dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Haug, with help from Schwengber, has been having fun on Twitter, a medium enabling him to converse with people who need never know that he is deaf-blind. On social media, Haug is &ldquo;just a person behind the Twitter account saying something&rdquo;, explains Schwengber. Haug describes it as a bit like playing carnival, because &ldquo;you just mask up and say anything you want&rdquo;, translates Schwengber. &ldquo;Content matters, not the person,&rdquo; she explains. So Haug gets a kick out of the reaction from followers when he Tweets amusing things, something he&rsquo;d be able to do more easily and independently with his own Lorm glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the first thing he would say with a Lorm glove of his own, Haug says he would talk to his cousin in Stuttgart and ask him if he can remember the name of an interesting film they recently spoke about. (Schwengber and Haug often go to the cinema &ndash; where Schwengber simultaneously translates the movie for Haug via Lorm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted the digital revolution and the amazing new connections it has offered. For those constrained by a barrier of unseen sights and unheard sounds, it was once unexplored territory &ndash; but with the Lorm glove, they might just have that world in the palm of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-13T09:29:01Z","HeadlineLong":"The glove that transmits touch over the internet","HeadlineShort":"The glove turning touch into talk","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Blind-deaf people are often forced to live in a small and isolated world.

For me, the answer is not pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m about four years old, and I&rsquo;m sitting in the green-carpeted hallway of our family&rsquo;s first home in Biloxi, Mississippi. The bathroom door stands open in front of me, and my mother is emerging from the shower. As she pulls a towel from the rack, I notice a dark stain marring that clean, fluffy pink material. It&rsquo;s a cockroach. I see it before she does. As she wraps the towel around her body, however, it quickly makes itself known. She shrieks, flailing and stomping, suddenly naked and vulnerable and afraid. I begin to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently asked my mother about this event, and she had no idea what I was talking about. Perhaps I dreamed it, or my early memory is flawed. Or perhaps it was just business-as-usual in our Southern US home, where &ndash; no matter what chemical barriers were erected &ndash; cockroaches inevitably found their way inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real or imaginary, this incident triggered an intense dislike of cockroaches that would only intensify as years passed and encounters with those creatures multiplied. For me, a roach is not just an insect. It is a psychological gateway into a lengthy laundry list of traumatic experiences: digging through a box of supplies in my outdoor playhouse when a roach zips out and scuttles up my leg, its spiky appendages pricking at my skin. Watching my first cat, Salty, as he traps a roach, dismembers it with his claws and mouth, and then eats the succulent, writhing remains. Finding a small dead cockroach tangled in my wet hair after a trip to the beach, and thereafter suffering recurring nightmares of picking roaches out of my hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roaches invade our homes and make those intimate spaces their own. As physical embodiments of filth and germs, they show that for all of our fortifications against dirt and disease, those efforts are ultimately futile. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve really figured out how to exploit the opportunities we create, and in doing so, developed behaviours and life histories that prevent us from controlling them,&rdquo; says Jeff Lockwood, a professor of natural sciences and humanities at the University of Wyoming. &ldquo;In a sense, we loathe that which we foster.&rdquo; Our very existence enables them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true nature of that relationship &ndash; and the irrational fear it so often inspires &ndash; was something I was compelled to learn more about for very personal reasons. That mission would require me to dig out the cockroach exoskeletons in my closet, explore intriguing new techniques to help us conquer insect fear, and ultimately confront the terror head-on, by journeying into the heart of six-legged darkness, at one of the premier cockroach labs in the world. Along the way, however, I would uncover an unsettling truth about the future of our relationship with roaches, and it would transform the way I see these life-long foes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xptg\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving into cockroach lore, I quickly learned that our distaste for them goes way back. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/magazine/25PHENOM.html\"&gt;ancient Egyptians fashioned spells&lt;/a&gt; imploring the ram-headed god Khnum to banish cockroaches; in ancient Rome, &lt;a href=\"http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Nature18701110&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Nature18701110.p0007&amp;isize=text\"&gt;Pliny the Elder wrote&lt;/a&gt; of the &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; nature of those pests; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH5KAhdU2iQ\"&gt;John Smith of Jamestown complained&lt;/a&gt; of the &ldquo;ill-scented dung&rdquo; of the &ldquo;cacarooch&rdquo;, which quickly took up residence throughout the New World. By the 19th Century, the handful of cockroach species that carved out a niche for themselves as pests had more or less achieved global domination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet given what we know today, logically it does not make sense to fear cockroaches. Unlike mosquitoes, ticks or fleas, roaches aren&rsquo;t disease vectors, and they do not feed directly on our blood, skin or fluids. We don&rsquo;t go screaming when we see a mosquito, even though they are the &lt;a href=\"http://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week\"&gt;world&rsquo;s deadliest animal&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, cockroaches wallow in filth, but a case of food poisoning is probably about as bad as it gets if one of those pests skitters across your slice of pizza &ndash; a stroll through the park compared to malaria, yellow fever or dengue fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xplc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, anecdotally, many people suffer from katsaridaphobia, or cockroach phobia. Lockwood guesses that the number reaches well into the tens of millions, and Richard Kaae, an entomologist at California State University, thinks that cockroaches are the number one insects feared by humans. Quantifying the impacts of katsaridaphobia is difficult, however. The vast majority of people incapacitated by roaches never seek help, primarily because they want to do everything possible to avoid even speaking of those creatures. I was one of them &ndash; until I decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;They creep up on you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had been busy all afternoon in my New Orleans kitchen, preparing dinner for a guy I liked. After the meal, we headed outside to enjoy the magnolia-perfumed breeze drifting off the Mississippi. As I coyly sipped my wine &lt;/em&gt;&ndash; &lt;em&gt;SMACK! &lt;/em&gt;&ndash; &lt;em&gt;a flying cockroach touched down straight on my cheek. Releasing a staccato scream, I spasmodically jerked my arms upward and sent a waterfall of red wine down my date&rsquo;s face and white shirt. He stood there, stunned. That roach ruined my date.&nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the worst cases, roaches actively impact the victim&rsquo;s life. Psychologists report patients too terrified to get out of bed at night or to go to the kitchen for fear of encountering a cockroach. Emily Driscoll, a documentary producer in New York City, once became trapped in a hotel room in India because a roach was sitting on the door handle. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t move, I was paralysed,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I needed to keep in it my sight.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026yvc8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stein, a computer programmer who grew up in New Orleans but now lives in New York, also recalls once being trapped by a roach. One night in his newly renovated Brooklyn apartment, he heard a familiar scratch-scratch-scratch coming from the bathroom. &ldquo;This was not a place I was expecting to see a bunch of insects,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I thought, &lsquo;That sounds like it could be a cockroach.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating, he found a large American cockroach clinging to his bath towel. He spent the next two hours camped out in the hallway, trying to work up the courage to go back inside and kill the roach. When his roommate came home at around 2am, however, Stein saw a better way out: he paid his roommate $10 to dispose of the roach rather than face it himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably the most emasculating thing I&rsquo;ve ever told anyone,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint what exactly it is about cockroaches that bothers people so much, simply because there are so many answers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re erratic; it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re doing eight things at once; they look dirty; they move really fast; they seem to have no fear of people,&rdquo; Stein rattles off. &ldquo;The first thing I think about when I see one is that that thing could jump across the room and touch me if it wanted to &ndash; and there&rsquo;s nothing I could do about it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq07\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lockwood explains, the things we find so repulsive about roaches are all a matter of those creatures&rsquo; biology. &ldquo;Cockroaches tap into this sort of evolutionary aversion we have to greasy, smelly, slimy things,&rdquo; he says. Their unpredictable movements and phenomenal speed &ndash; relative to their size, they&rsquo;re one of the fastest terrestrial animals on Earth &ndash; evolved as escape mechanisms for evading predators. Their stench, too, is indicative of an underlying purpose. The reason why smashed cockroaches smell like a clogged truck stop toilet that&rsquo;s been fermenting in 90-degree heat is because they store nitrogenous waste &ndash; uric acid, specifically &ndash; in their fat for recycling. Finally, their sickly slick feel derives from a lipid-based wax that their cuticle secretes to prevent water loss. None of these traits bode well for the human observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Plus,&rdquo; Lockwood adds, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re defiant little bastards.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roaches are incredibly prolific, and hard to get rid of. If you start out with one pair of German cockroaches and allow them to reproduce in peace and with bountiful food available, then &ldquo;within a couple years you could have two to three million&rdquo;, Kaae says. They&rsquo;ll also eat just about anything, from cork to paper to grass. In the heaviest of infestations &ndash; on Navy submarines and in children&rsquo;s bedrooms alike &ndash; they will gnaw off their sleeping victims&rsquo; eyelashes.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those physical and behavioural traits do not explain why roaches are so frequently the subjects of phobias. As it turns out, the root of that fear often traces back to some traumatic experience in life, such as witnessing your mother scream at the sight of a roach. Often, that fear forms early, around the age of four or five. &ldquo;Evolutionarily, we&rsquo;re highly attuned to picking up on cultural clues from parents and society as to how we ought to respond to insects,&rdquo; Lockwood says. &ldquo;Today, most of that feedback is negative so we wind up raising anxious children.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq4f\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some do manage to evade that fear, however. Philip Koehler, a veteran entomologist with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, probably spends more time (voluntarily) with cockroaches than almost anyone else in the world. At his lab at the University of Florida, he keeps around a million of those insects. Although intimately familiar with the roach antics that bother so many people, he&rsquo;s nonplussed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t overcome any fear because I never had any fear,&rdquo; he says, chuckling. &ldquo;I was probably a twisted individual right from start.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fascination with those creatures does have its limits, however. &ldquo;Personally, I don&rsquo;t find them to be attractive,&rdquo; he admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a warm spring morning I dropped by Koehler&rsquo;s office with a two-fold mission: glean all I can about his pesky research subjects and, more importantly, confront them one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clutter of Koehler&rsquo;s office reflects a nearly 40-year career; the walls and shelves are crowded with gag gifts and posters professing his comical hatred, not of roaches, but of cats; faded, poster-sized prints of the horrendous cockroach infestations of the 80s; and a wall full of awards. Outside, a disturbingly realistic 6-foot tall metal cockroach sculpture, lovingly crafted by one of his former students, guards his door. Earlier, one of Koehler&rsquo;s students warned me that &ldquo;Dr Koehler loves to make people feel strange&rdquo;, and I half expect some sort of trickery &ndash; a roach in my coffee, an insect tossed my way, but luckily we start slow. The trust is not broken. He&rsquo;s here to help. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0274219\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koehler is no psychologist, but he&rsquo;s familiar with treatments for cockroach phobias. Several years ago, a woman in her 50s approached him. She said her life was completely disrupted by cockroaches; everywhere she went, she couldn&rsquo;t function because she was always on the lookout for a cockroach. Was there anything he could do to help? He invited her to the lab for an informal session of exposure therapy, starting small by simply talking about roaches, then progressing to photos, pinned roaches and eventually the real deal. After several visits, her hyperventilating stopped and she was even able to hold a hissing cockroach. I&rsquo;ve travelled to Gainesville to see if the same treatment could work for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He begins by weeding out my issue with roaches. &ldquo;What is it you don&rsquo;t like about them?&rdquo; he asks, peering inquisitively from behind wire-framed glasses. &ldquo;The colour, the movement, maybe the feel of their legs?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I relay a few of my stories, trying to make him understand, and he listens patiently until I finish. &ldquo;So the roaches never really hurt you?&rdquo; he asks, leaning forward over the desk. He&rsquo;s challenging the logic of my fear &ndash; a tried and true tactic when it comes to treating irrational phobias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Well, no, I guess not,&rdquo; I admit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just they were there&hellip; They were in my space&hellip;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They just startled you,&rdquo; he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Yeah, I guess it must be something about the surprise&hellip;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xqbl\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&rsquo;s technically right, but I don&rsquo;t feel fully satisfied with the conclusion we&rsquo;ve reached. &ldquo;Startled&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t begin to articulate what roaches manage to do to me. Later, I realise how I should have conveyed the problem. When a roach slinks into my bedroom at night or flies into my face, I am forced to acknowledge that all is not under my control. Just as a leering cat-caller or subway groper might not inflict physical harm on his victims, that undesirable interaction can still inspire intense distress. Unprovoked danger &ndash; whether actual or perceived &ndash; can appear without warning. It can slink out of a dark alleyway or from beneath a closet door at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their victims, cockroaches commit a personal violation. In the words of George A. Romero, &lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/53490236\"&gt;they creep up on you&lt;/a&gt;. And there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet could there be a way to conquer that aversion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exposure therapy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Hey, Roach!&rdquo; a third-grade classmate jeered at me one day. Cleverly, he had replaced my nickname, &ldquo;Rach&rdquo;, with that of my nemesis. But rather than being offended, I fully embraced the new moniker, drawing cartoon roaches on folded notes passed under desks to friends, encouraging the nickname&rsquo;s use. Roaches are cute, I told myself, even lovable. There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of. But when a living roach would appear in the school bathroom or gym, these soothing thoughts were revealed for what they really were: lies told to comfort a scared little girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over the years, I noticed my phobia intensifying. Viewing this as a weakness, I tried in my own ways to self medicate. In high school, I stayed up late playing &ldquo;Bad Mojo,&rdquo; a computer game about a criminal entomologist who is transformed into a cockroach, and encouraged slumber party karaoke of &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s Apartment&rdquo; cockroach &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru_EiJgTodQ\"&gt;song renditions&lt;/a&gt;. But digitised, anthropomorphised roaches on a two-dimensional screen and real-life roaches are not at all the same beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit older and living in New Orleans, I volunteered to work at the Audubon Zoo&rsquo;s hands-on Discovery Walk, and requested to work with the Madagascar hissing cockroaches and giant Brazilian cockroaches. Perhaps if I demonstrated roaches&rsquo; harmlessness to children, I thought, I could somehow undo my own distaste for them. But even though I regularly handled those exotic species, I still performed a sort of panicked Riverdance each time one of their urban cousins crossed my path in the infested Crescent City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq1z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to believe that anything could ever change my feelings and reaction towards roaches. But not everyone agrees with this hopeless prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defeating phobias, therapists insist, just requires becoming habituated to the cause of that fear, whether it&rsquo;s cockroaches, heights or being in crowds. Expose someone to the same thing over and over again and it will eventually become boring and commonplace. Untold numbers of phobics go untreated, however, simply because few possess the unique mix of desperation and bravery needed to willingly sign up for the chance to interact with a cockroach. &ldquo;The idea of touching a roach is pretty much the worst thing I can think of,&rdquo; Stein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some therapists are designing workarounds for skittish patients. A team of researchers at the James I University in Spain &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569788\"&gt;thinks that augmented reality&lt;/a&gt; could be a solution for treating cockroach phobia. Augmented reality projects computerised images into the real world, allowing a more convincing encounter. To apply this for cockroach phobia treatments, a headset combined with a six degrees of freedom tracking system creates a vision of cockroaches running over the wearer&rsquo;s actual hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xpxm\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the system, the Spanish researchers recruited six participants, all of who suffered from debilitating, clinically verified cockroach phobias. One participant wanted to sell her apartment after spotting a roach, while another refused to visit her grandmother for fear of seeing a cockroach. Still others reported &ldquo;complete loss of control&rdquo; when seeing a cockroach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before undergoing augmented reality therapy, none of the women would agree to enter a room that contained a live cockroach in a plastic container. After putting on the augmented reality headset and watching fantasy roaches crawl all over their hands for one to three hours, however, the women&rsquo;s anxiety levels slowly began to decline. When the treatment session concluded, they were able to approach the live cockroach and even stick a finger into its container for a few seconds. Twelve months after the original treatment, the participants maintained those improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;A phobic brain has stored bad information about cockroaches: it thinks cockroaches are very, very dangerous,&rdquo; says Cristina Botella, a professor of clinical psychology and leader of the study. The augmented reality system, however, changes that fear structure by demonstrating cockroaches&rsquo; harmlessness. &ldquo;The brain is able to store new information that is not compatible with the old,&rdquo; she says. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, augmented reality is not yet available in a clinical setting. Until further research can be completed and the treatment gains approval for use in therapy, phobics wishing to rid themselves of their fear must go about it in the old fashioned way: through cognitive behaviour therapy paired with exposure therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who can garner the courage to try it, their efforts are often rewarded in as few as one to three sessions. &ldquo;These therapies provide a way to live with those creatures rather than spend a life trying to avoid them,&rdquo; Lockwood says. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq36\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Gainesville, I&rsquo;m hoping this kind of therapy might work for me. We leave Koehler&rsquo;s office, heading to a closed door just down the hall. &ldquo;And here we have our cockroach room!&rdquo; he proclaims, swinging open the portal to my personal hell. I want to wait a moment to gather my resolve, but he shoos me in. Suddenly, I am surrounded by at least a million roaches of 14 different species. They are on display no more than four feet in front of me, in dozens of glass jars fitted with deceptively festive orange and blue lids. Each contains a teeming mass of insects, from bitty babies smaller than my pinky nail to giant Brazilian cockroaches larger than a mouse. My gaze, however, immediately seeks out and settles on that most reviled species of all: the American cockroach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There they sit, about a dozen of them: bloated, shining, and the colour of slick sewage, the glass of their enclosure stained with faeces and regurgitate. Their antennae waggle as they slowly mull about the confines of their glass enclosure. I can hear them; the gentle scratch, scratch, scratch of their spiny feet. As Koehler and Liz Pereira, the lab&rsquo;s official &ldquo;roach rearer,&rdquo; parade various specimens before me &ndash; the comical Madagascar hissing roaches, pullers of toy tractors; the Suriname cockroach, which burrows into its substrate like an earthworm; a colony of German cockroaches named after the Chinese restaurant they were collected from; the Cuban cockroach, a striking chartreuse creature with delicate wings, the only lovable one of the bunch, but sadly discovered to have died sometime over the past day &ndash; my peripheral vision never leaves those American cockroaches. I can feel it in the hairs on my arms, in the racy beat of my heart and slight shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026ywc4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the moment to confront those monsters has arrived. Pereira pulls the American cockroaches off their place on the shelf and gently deposits them on the counter before me. I take an instinctive step back, putting Koehler&rsquo;s body between the roaches and myself, subconsciously seeking out a protective parental presence as that timeless fear resurfaces. Pereira, meanwhile, is all giggles. &ldquo;On my first day here I reacted like you,&rdquo; she says, grinning. Then, she moves to remove the lid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Wait! Won&rsquo;t they fly out?&rdquo; I protest &ndash; but it&rsquo;s already done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reek of their existence fills the small room, and I crinkle my nose while craning my neck toward the jar. Nestled within protective folds of cardboard, several large roaches wave back to me with their antennae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I swallow, and then ask, &ldquo;Is it possible to touch one?&rdquo; Koehler grins. &ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one swift motion, Pereira snatches the cardboard shelter from the jar, seamlessly transferring it to another empty container and banging it against the walls. The roaches tumble forth from their hideout, scattering around the glass enclosure in startled confusion. She uses carbon dioxide to sedate them (I&rsquo;m curious but not crazy). Eventually, they all grow still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira reaches in and scoops one up. &ldquo;Want to hold it?&rdquo; she asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I extend a trembling hand, and she drops a fat specimen it into my open palm. My brain struggles to register this conflicting information &ndash; I am holding a cockroach, and it&rsquo;s fine &ndash; and I laugh nervously, slightly hysterically even, as Koehler snaps a few photos. And then it&rsquo;s over. Pereira gently takes the roach and returns it to its slumbering friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq51\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, I send a photo of myself holding the roach to my boyfriend. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t count if you&rsquo;re wearing a glove!&rdquo; he texts back. He clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand, I think, shaking my head. Only a fellow phobic would understand. Glove or no glove, I held a cockroach, and I survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, what we&rsquo;ve discovered about roaches recently suggests that, if we value our health, it&rsquo;s wise to avoid physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cause for alarm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;One early morning during my teenage years, I groggily got out of bed and reached for a box of cookie leftovers on my bedroom floor. I took a big bite, and &ndash; while chewing &ndash; casually noticed a large chunk of chocolate icing was still in the box. Except it wasn&rsquo;t icing. It was a tremendous American cockroach. A roach that had, for all I know, dredged itself in raw sewage and rotting meat, not to mention toting along its own natural garden of microbial terror. I spewed out my mouthful, splattering my white and pink flower-patterned wallpaper with dark streaks of chocolate-infused spittle. Those stains never did come out.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There was a reason I wore that glove in Koehler&rsquo;s roach room. People have long suspected that cockroaches are mechanical transmitters of disease &ndash; they walk through rot and faeces and filth and then deposit those germs onto other surfaces. But it&rsquo;s hard to prove that a cockroach is to blame for a case of food poisoning when it could be a chef&rsquo;s dirty hands or any number of other factors that introduced the contamination. Several years ago, however, Koehler and one of his students helped prove that cockroaches could at least &lt;a href=\"http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0006617/00001\"&gt;plausibly transmit harmful bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. Bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 &ndash; the deadly kind &ndash; can actually swim through the cockroaches&rsquo; waxy outer layers and survive there for at least two months, all the while posing a risk for being transferred to food. Bacteria can also survive a trip through a cockroach gut, so faeces scattered throughout a kitchen or home are like little land mines of potential disease.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq8c\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spreading disease, however, likely is not their biggest impact on our health. Proteins found in cockroach faeces, regurgitates, skin and body parts are potent allergens for many people, as proven when entomologists often become acutely allergic to their research subjects. One famous cockroach expert, William Bell, grew so allergic to the arthropods&rsquo; cuticles that he could no longer eat lobster by the end of his career. Likewise, some people who seem to be allergic to coffee or chocolate are actually just aversely reacting to ground up cockroach parts sprinkled into those products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the worst problems with cockroach allergies occur in urban centres, where there&rsquo;s often no escaping them. People breathe in whiffs of cockroaches on the subway and in restaurants, on the bus and in the street. For many, especially those who live in large apartment buildings with inadequate pest control, their homes are also perfumed with these invisible allergens. If a neighbour isn&rsquo;t taking care of his cockroach problem, then it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that those allergens will find their way into adjacent apartments, through air vents, shared hallways and pioneering insects travelling through communal walls and plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xpk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are the most impacted victims of cockroach allergies, which have also been associated with asthma attacks. The distribution of asthma is not at all even across New York. In some neighbourhoods, rates soar to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Manhattan&rsquo;s far north, on 168th street, Matt Perzanowski studies these allergens at his lab at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. He and his colleagues travel to homes across the city and vacuum up dust samples in kitchens and beds. In his white, sterile lab, he analyses the contents of those vials for cockroach parts. From looking, you&rsquo;d never guess that the bodies and refuse of six-legged invaders taint those harmless-looking bits of fuzz and dust. &ldquo;Cockroaches haven&rsquo;t changed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The critical thing that&rsquo;s changed in terms of exposure is that kids just spent a lot more time inside now, which means they&rsquo;re around cockroaches more.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are surely other factors, but Perzanowski has found that kids who live in neighbourhoods with higher rates of asthma are about twice as likely to be allergic to roaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roaches, in other words, are more than just a source of irrational fear. They may be making us unwell. The question is, what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The coming war&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;I douse the roach in a stream of Raid, taking perverse pleasure in its dance of death. Try as it might, the roach can no longer get a grip on the plaster wall. It topples backward, antennae flailing, wings unfolding, running in frenzied figure-of-eights as if searching for a way out. But it will find no respite from the neurotoxin. Minutes later, it has bucked itself onto its back, its abdomen curled into itself, the closest a roach could come to a foetal position. Life occasionally reasserts itself with a deceptive spasm of the legs, but I know this roach is toast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Naively, we thought we could stop them. Back in the 1990s, we assumed the war was won when bait traps hit the market. After decades of inefficient home treatments, we had finally developed a method that seemed to completely devastate the enemy. For roaches, baits were &ldquo;like crack-cocaine, the roaches loved them so much&rdquo;, says Jack Brans, owners of Brans Pest Control in Harahan, Louisiana. The hoards were pushed back, the cockroach problem all but eliminated. We humans became complacent. Assuming the problem had been taken care of, fewer entomologists dedicated their studies to roaches, and funding for roach-related research and poisons shifted to other pests, like bedbugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that success will likely be short-lived. In the early 2000s, a darkness began to re-emerge in kitchens and bathrooms across the country. Whispers of a growing enemy proliferated at entomological conferences across the country. The roaches, experts realised, had begun to fight back. Baits were no longer as effective as they once were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xpg7\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, researchers discovered at least one of the problems: cockroaches have evolved a glucose aversion. The sweetener that roaches originally found irresistible now registers as bitter. With a dearth of researchers available to battle those insects and plenty of regulatory hurdles in the way of developing speedy alternatives, some believe that we&rsquo;re poised on the edge of a coming invasion. &ldquo;Right now, the German cockroach is making this huge comeback,&rdquo; Koehler says. &ldquo;A pest control operator called me just today and said that roaches are running all over the place, that they haven&rsquo;t found anything that will kill them.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koehler believes that we will never defeat the roaches. As he points out, those insects were already doing well for themselves for hundreds of millions of years before we showed up. We just gave them the extra boost they needed for global domination. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been able to come up with solutions for almost everything that&rsquo;s been thrown at them for more than 300 million years,&rdquo; he says, a hint of awe in his voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that humans could survive the changes that cockroaches have endured.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, they will outlast us, too. When our species finally bites the dust, cockroaches will be there to feast on the rotting remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&rsquo;ve come to realise, we need to master our phobias. If not, Koehler warns, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to be living in a roach-filled, skittish society&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for me, I don&rsquo;t plan on nurturing roach colonies in my apartment anytime soon, and I&rsquo;ll continue to keep a can of Raid under my sink. But when the summer approaches and the roaches creep out of their hiding places, I&rsquo;ve resolved to try to do what many other New Yorkers do: just ignore them. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d be setting myself up for a very distressing future indeed. It&rsquo;s time to get over my fear, and learn to live with our conquerors.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Do you have a cockroach experience you&rsquo;d like to share? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let us know on our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"559a52610b808738c4e262a1"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262db"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Science &amp; Environment","Name":"Science &amp; Environment","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Science &amp; Environment"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:45.984509Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"1aa4ccec-87b5-44b8-b5af-c553debaf6f6","Id":"wwfuture/section/science-environment","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:51:20.083392Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/science-environment"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/science-environment","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262dc"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262dd"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Cockroaches: The insect we're programmed to fear","HeadlineShort":"The bug were programmed to fear","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Why are we so revolted by roaches?

On and on, everything from enormous cargo lifters to lumbering bombers, Hercules freighters and the F-14 Tomcat fighters made famous in Top Gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, run by the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG). It&rsquo;s home to some 4,400 aircraft, arranged over nearly 2,600 acres (10.5 sq km). Some look like they were parked only a few hours ago, others are swathed in protective coverings to keep out the sand and dust. Inside the facilities' hangars, other planes have been reduced to crates of spare parts, waiting to be sent out to other bases in the US or across the world to help other aircraft take to the air again. To those who work here, Davis-Monthan is known by a far less prosaic name, one more in keeping with the Wild West folklore from Arizona&rsquo;s earlier days. They call it The Boneyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis-Monthan is not the only aircraft boneyard in the world, but it is by far the biggest. The climatic conditions in Arizona &ndash; dry heat, low humidity, little rain &ndash; mean aircraft take a lot longer to rust and degrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026vj8m\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, underneath the top six inches of dirt topsoil is a clay-like sub layer called caliche. This extremely hard subsoil allows the planes to be parked in the desert without the need to construct expensive new parking ramps, according to the 309 AMARG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planes are expensive things to build and maintain, but even at the end of their flying lives they still have their uses. But it takes a lot of room &ndash; and a lot of money &ndash; to store these unused planes in the kind of hangars needed to keep them warm and dry. It&rsquo;s much cheaper to store them in the kind of conditions found in Tucson. That&rsquo;s the reason why many of the world&rsquo;s biggest aircraft boneyards are found in the dry deserts of the south-western US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&rsquo;s not simply a case of landing a plane at Davis-Monthan, parking it in one of the rows and handing someone the keys. Many of the aircraft are considered inactive, but have to be able to be brought back into service if need be. That takes a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken bombers&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Boneyard&rsquo;s workers have an exhaustive checklist. Any planes that have served on aircraft carriers have to be thoroughly washed to get rid of corroding salt. All aircraft have their fuel tanks and fuel lines drained, and flushed with a light, viscous oil similar to that used in sewing machines to ensure all the moving parts are lubricated. Then they must have any explosive devices &ndash; such as the charges that activate ejection seats &ndash; safely removed. Then, any ducts or inlets are covered with aluminium tape and the aircraft are painted over with a special easily strippable paint &ndash; two coats of black, and a final white layer to help deflect the fierce desert sun and keep the aircraft relatively cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026wxhj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aircraft are kept at various levels of restoration &ndash; some are kept in as close-to-working order as possible if they are deemed to be needed to fly at a later date, while others are partially dismantled. Some of the aircraft stored at Davis-Monthan include retired B-52 bombers, aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons. As part of strategic arms limitation treaties with the Soviet Union, the B-52s were stored with their wings removed and placed next to the plane &ndash; allowing Soviet satellites to verify that the bombers had been taken out of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are used for spare parts, with the components sitting in the aircraft until they&rsquo;re needed. On site is a smelter, where some of the surplus aircraft are shredded and totally recycled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the original assembly lines of most of these aircraft long-since mothballed, Davis-Monthan is home to some 400,000 piece of tooling and machinery needed to create specific aircraft parts. Aircraft all over the world, not just those flown by the US, contain parts from the base&rsquo;s enormous stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Soviet boneyards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;As long as there are aircraft flying, military and commercial aircraft boneyards will always be necessary to keep other planes in the air,&rdquo; says aviation author Nick Veronico, who has visited Davis-Monthan as well as the Mojave facility and other boneyards in the desert states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026wwmk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Each of the storage yards typically performs a variety of functions from storing aircraft that are temporarily out of service but expected to return to the fleet, to reclaiming useable parts which are inspected, overhauled, and then held until needed by active aircraft, to dismantling of the aircraft carcasses. These functions go hand-in-hand and are part of the lifecycle of an aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I have flown on aircraft that have gone to the boneyard and provided parts to the fleet,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to watch parts being removed from a plane, and then having flown on an aircraft flying with salvaged parts &ndash; the exact parts I saw being removed, preserved, and installed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are boneyards in Russia that contain some of the old Soviet Union&rsquo;s military aircraft, but it&rsquo;s fair to say the aircraft here are not in any fit state to return to the skies. The former bomber base at Vozdvizhenka, some 60 miles north of Vladivostok in far-eastern Russia, used to be home to Soviet supersonic bombers. After the end of the Cold War the aircraft were surplus to requirement &ndash; and simply left where they were parked. The once-secretive base in now abandoned, and this ghostly bomber fleet now poses for photographers who clamber through the rusted fences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026vjc2\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another post-Soviet boneyard is in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone &ndash; the area evacuated after the 1986 nuclear disaster in Ukraine. The vehicles used to help clean up the disaster area were contaminated with radiation. A line of giant Soviet helicopters has been left to rust in the fields. BBC News pictures editor Phil Coomes visited the site in 2006, on the 20th anniversary of the disaster. &ldquo;After the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, many of the contaminated vehicles used in the clean-up operation were placed in graveyards in the vast exclusion zone around the reactor. Some remain there today,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The largest graveyard, Rassokha, [is] where the remains of helicopters, military and civilian vehicles and fire engines are slowly rusting away. It&rsquo;s a vast site, but over the years parts have been reclaimed for spares but contamination levels vary, so souvenir hunters would be wise to keep away.&rdquo; Despite the danger of radiation poisoning, many of the helicopters have been stripped of useful parts; their skeletal remains dwindle with every passing year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In eastern California, Mojave Airport carries out a similar role for civilian aircraft that have reached the end of their operational lives. Airliners have been flown here for decades, and stored in the dry desert heat until broken up for scrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026wxqn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Driving across California&rsquo;s high desert, the airliner boneyard at Mojave airport is visible from miles away,&rdquo; writes aviation photographer Troy Paiva, who photographed airliners here in the 1990s and 2000s before security concerns made it a no-go area. &ldquo;The long rows of faded tails seem to stretch to the horizon.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Royal Aeronautical Society&rsquo;s Keith Hayward says aircraft are less of a headache to dismantle than other heavy transport. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how easy an aeroplane is to dismantle, but what goes together comes apart, and there&rsquo;s a lot less heavy or dangerous materials associated with aircraft than ships.&rdquo; But as less and less recyclable metal goes into making modern planes, the epic scale of the desert boneyards may be reduced. &ldquo;In the future, the use of composites may make life more difficult to deal with final disposal, but there are industry protocols that are addressing the issue. But bone-yard parking will still be useful when demand fluctuates. Indeed, the numbers of parked airliners is often a good sign of slump or recovery, and is monitored by analysts.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Tucson, the long rows of planes at Davis-Monthan sit in the Arizona heat. For some, the sun-baked desert is a kind of aviation retirement home. For others, their flying days are not quite over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The secrets of the desert aircraft boneyards","HeadlineShort":"Secrets of the aircraft boneyards","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"What happens when an aircraft is no longer needed?

Is there anywhere left, I asked, free from invasive species? Genovesi chairs the &lt;a href=\"http://www.issg.org/index.html\"&gt;Invasive Species Specialist Group&lt;/a&gt; at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, so he spends much of his time fretting about animal alien invaders. Whether it&rsquo;s voracious cane toads or pesky squirrels, these creatures cause havoc by invading a place they don&rsquo;t belong, outcompeting other animals, eating up resources and becoming pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if there are any pristine ecosystems remaining, where would they be? &ldquo;This is not an easy question, and one I&rsquo;ve never asked myself,&rdquo; Genovesi says. Still, he was intrigued enough to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason it&rsquo;s a tricky question is because invaded lands vastly outnumber the places still untouched. Where humans go, invasive species tend to follow, Genovesi says, and &ldquo;there is literally no island in the world that has had no contact with humans in the last century&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;ve taxied invasive species around the globe for millennia. Some of the &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-4877.2012.00309.x/abstract\"&gt;earliest mammal invasions&lt;/a&gt; occurred 8,000 to 9,000 years ago, when Neolithic humans introduced wild boars to Sicily and shrews to Cyprus, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. In AD77, Pliny the Elder penned the oldest written evidence of invasive species&rsquo; impacts, &lt;a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=384\"&gt;writing in his Naturalis Historia&lt;/a&gt; that rabbits were causing famines on the Balearic Islands, which forced desperate residents to start throwing ferrets into the rabbit burrows as a means of controlling those insatiable pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passenger aliens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from something confined to history, however, detrimental species introductions continue to happen frequently today, from egg-hungry &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/science/a-lizard-interloper-presents-challenge-in-florida.html?_r=0\"&gt;Argentine black and white tegus&lt;/a&gt; taking up residence in Florida, to a sudden influx of &lt;a href=\"http://urbanentomology.tamu.edu/ants/rasberry.html\"&gt;exotic crazy ants&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. Invasive species have been implicated in &lt;a href=\"http://200.46.218.171/bds-cbc/sites/default/files/TREE05.pdf\"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of recent extinctions and they ring up more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/PythonPDF/CostofInvasivesFactSheet.pdf\"&gt;$120bn&lt;/a&gt; in annual damages in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these stowaways are inadvertent passengers &ndash; the rats, roaches and other pests that we ourselves cannot manage to contain. Others are intentionally introduced, whether for food, as pets or in an ill-devised attempt to control another species that we want to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their ubiquity, however, Genovesi figured that places free from invasive species must exist, even if he was not aware of them himself. So he submitted the question to the &ldquo;Aliens-list,&rdquo; a professional listserve whose 1,000-plus members make up the world&rsquo;s invasive species management frontline. Putting their collective knowledge to use, they came up with a few examples of places that are most likely free of invasive species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026btqp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, only the most remote and extreme ecosystems have managed to exclude invaders. &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140303-last-place-on-earth-without-life\"&gt;Thermophilic bacteria&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; the kinds that flourish in environments subjected to excessive heat &ndash; likely live free from invaders. Such spots include the hot springs of Yellowstone and Iceland, the edges of deep sea geothermal vents and some volcanic soil. Extremely dry areas, such as the Arabian Desert, also have few if any non-native species. The open ocean&rsquo;s pelagic zone &ndash; the layer of water located between the surface and the sea floor &ndash; is usually alien-free as well, as is the deep sea. Caves also tend to escape invasion, although the fungus that causes the deadly white-nose disease in bats is increasingly turning up in those habitats, especially in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the polar areas largely escaped the presence of invasive species. But concerns are growing that the situation is already beginning to change thanks to an increasing number of tourists, scientists and adventurers visiting those regions, as well as the lessening extremity of those environments, because of climate change. Researchers in Svalbard, an archipelago located in the Arctic Circle, found &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10530-011-0098-4\"&gt;more than 1,000 seeds from 53 species&lt;/a&gt; of alien plants stuck to the shoes of visitors arriving over a single summer, for example, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/environment/wildlife/non_native_species.php\"&gt;dozens of non-native species&lt;/a&gt; ranging from moths to flies have been spotted buzzing around research stations in Antarctica. So far, none of the invertebrates seem to have permanently established itself on the Antarctic continent, but scientists fear it&rsquo;s only a matter of time. The nearby South Georgia Island, for example, has already succumbed to that fate: invasive beetles are chomping their way through native ones, and &lt;a href=\"http://news.wildlife.org/wpn/invasive-species-control-programs-underway-on-south-georgia-island/\"&gt;rats and introduced reindeer&lt;/a&gt; threaten seabird populations there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026btzw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable exception to the where-there&rsquo;s-humans-there&rsquo;s-invasive-species rule are remote tracts of rainforest. Few if any alien species live deep within the Amazon or in Borneo, despite the &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140804-sad-truth-of-uncontacted-tribes\"&gt;presence of people living there&lt;/a&gt;. But that&rsquo;s because those isolated tribes don&rsquo;t come into contact with potential invaders themselves. Typically, even the remotest places &ndash; Gough Island in the South Atlantic, Palmyra Atoll in the Pacific &ndash; contain the living relics of humans&rsquo; time there. &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10530-005-0421-z\"&gt;Rats alone have reached at least 90% of the world&rsquo;s islands&lt;/a&gt; thanks to our movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign of hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet could any invaded ecosystems eventually rejoin this list of pristine places? If what&rsquo;s been happening over the past few years in New Zealand offers any clues, then there&rsquo;s some cause for optimism.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a country largely free from endemic mammals, New Zealand &ndash; the last large islands in the world to be settled by humans &ndash; is particularly vulnerable to the effects of warm-blooded creatures. It started with the first Polynesian settlers, and later with Europeans. &ldquo;New Zealand was a place of birds,&rdquo; says Nick Holmes, director of science at Island Conservation, a non-profit organisation that specialises in invasive species eradication. &ldquo;The only native mammals there were bats and marine mammals.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, New Zealand&rsquo;s fauna is about evenly divided between native and alien species. Of the country&rsquo;s approximately 800 islands, less than 1% escaped the arrival of more than 30 alien mammals, including rats, weasels, mice, goats, pigs and brushtail possums. &ldquo;In just a few hundred years, the environment has undergone a nearly complete transformation,&rdquo; says Mick Clout, a conservation biologist at the University of Auckland, and former chair of the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026btrt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1960, the problems caused by the invaders could no longer be ignored. Species such as the &lt;a href=\"http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/\"&gt;kakapo parrot&lt;/a&gt; were quickly disappearing, and possums turned out to be vectors of bovine tuberculosis, causing considerable impacts to the country&rsquo;s beef industry. At first, New Zealand experts thought that management, not eradication, was the only option available to them. But the late ornithologist &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2011/05/13/the-man-who-loved-birds-don-merton-1939-2011/\"&gt;Don Merton&lt;/a&gt; stumbled upon the discovery that rats could indeed be poisoned out of existence after he distributed Warfarin baits around &lt;a href=\"http://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/nz8624/Maria-Island-(Ruapuke-Island)/Auckland\"&gt;Maria Island&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, New Zealanders realised that getting rid of rodent pests for good was a plausible reality. &ldquo;Basically, no one else could really help because clearing these pests from islands had never been done before,&rdquo; Clout says. &ldquo;Conservationists here, as opposed to many other places in the world, became very aware that preserving native wildlife and forests unfortunately involved killing things rather than just protecting what we have.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blunt tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts began crudely. Acute toxins delivered via ground-based operations did an acceptable job of getting rid of rodents, but the delivery was inefficient and the poisons led to an inhumane end for those creatures. Additionally, some animals received a sub-lethal dose and then learned to avoid the hazardous baits. But the country&rsquo;s tactics have evolved over time, to the point that other nations began hiring New Zealand contractors to carry out foreign eradications. &ldquo;We figured it out by trial and error,&rdquo; says John Parkes, a retired scientist who freelances as an invasive species consultant. &ldquo;The breakthrough for rodents came in the 1980s, when New Zealanders began using brodifacoum baits sown from the air.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026btrm\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, anticoagulant toxins delivered by air are the weapons of choice against island rodents because they take days or even weeks to take effect. That way, all of the rodents receive a toxic dose before realizing that something is amiss. Baits often have up to a 100% success rate for rodents, but other animals such as possums, cats and rabbits usually require on-the-ground teams to eliminate stragglers. Larger animals such as goats and deer, on the other hand, are typically shot, sometimes out of a helicopter. Success rates hover at &lt;a href=\"http://diise.islandconservation.org/\"&gt;around 85%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these efforts, around 150 New Zealand islands are now free from invasive mammals. This September, the country &lt;a href=\"http://newzealandecology.org/events/other-events\"&gt;celebrates its 50-year anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of rodent eradications. As New Zealand gradually works its way up to bigger islands, it even envisions becoming a &lt;a href=\"http://predatorfreenz.org/\"&gt;predator-free country&lt;/a&gt; someday. &ldquo;At the moment we don&rsquo;t have the money, strategy or technology to do that, but we shall see,&rdquo; says Parkes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invasive species eradication teams can now be found in numerous countries around the world (although many still do have some New Zealand involvement). The British recently undertook a massive reindeer, mice and rat eradication effort &lt;a href=\"http://www.sght.org/sght-habitat-restoration-project\"&gt;in South Georgia Island&lt;/a&gt;, while the Ecuadorians did the same for goats, pigs and donkeys on &lt;a href=\"http://www.galapagos.org/conservation/project-isabela/\"&gt;two of the islands&lt;/a&gt; that make up the Galapagos. More than 1,000 invasive species removals have been carried out to date on islands around the world, and the benefits they deliver to the local environment are usually readily apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026btrv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On California&rsquo;s Anacapa Island, for example, invasive rats &ndash; probably stranded there by a 19th Century shipwreck &ndash; were eating their way through vulnerable &lt;a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/62101249/0\"&gt;Scripps&rsquo;s Murrelet&lt;/a&gt; eggs and chicks. In 2002, wildlife managers called in &lt;a href=\"http://www.islandconservation.org/\"&gt;Island Conservation&lt;/a&gt;, which has carried out removal operations on 52 islands over the past 20 years, to get rid of the rats. With the vermin soon gone, birds almost immediately began to rebound. The Scripps&rsquo;s Murrelet population enjoyed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713000931\"&gt;nearly three-fold increase&lt;/a&gt; in hatching success, and Anacapa saw its &lt;a href=\"http://www.montroserestoration.noaa.gov/2012/12/17/anacapa-island-rat-removal-boosts-seabird-populations/\"&gt;first confirmed endangered Ashy storm-petrel nest&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;The Ashy storm-petrel is this little nocturnal seabird with this beautiful musty smell, but it&rsquo;s very vulnerable to rats because it breeds on the ground,&rdquo; Holmes says. &ldquo;Now that the rats are gone, we&rsquo;re starting to see the island return back to what it once might have been.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, Australia&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=13013\"&gt;Macquarie Island&lt;/a&gt; stands as the largest successful rodent eradication, with an area of about 13,000 hectares cleared of rats and mice, not to mention rabbits. But experts believe that there is an upper limit of the geographic size of an area that can be purged of all invasive species &ndash; even if they haven&rsquo;t hit that limit yet. Additionally, these extreme undertakings are also very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026btpj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while eradication does often work, experts agree that the most effective means of controlling invasive species is preventing them from arriving in the first place. Some countries do a better job at this than others. The US contains a line on its customs form asking whether visitors have spent time on farms or are bringing any plant or animal materials with them, for example, while New Zealand takes biosecurity to an extreme. &ldquo;When you arrive in the US, they ask you where you&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; Holmes says. &ldquo;In New Zealand, they want to see the soles of your boots.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more we travel though, the harder it gets to stem the flow. Wherever humans go &ndash; by foot, ship, train, plane, car, bus or bike &ndash; we tote other species along with us. So while there are uninvaded lands left &ndash; and some, like New Zealand, may soon even be reclaimed &ndash; it&rsquo;s near-impossible to preserve every ecosystem. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can stop the problem or get rid of invasive species entirely,&rdquo; Genovesi says. &ldquo;But we can mitigate their impacts and slow down the pattern of invasions that at the moment is really quite alarming.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-09T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The last places on Earth with no invasive species","HeadlineShort":"Are alien species everywhere?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Pockets of land and water that are free from alien species are few and far between, finds Rachel Nuwer.

Frequent flyers are often on guard against sneezing or coughing co-passengers, in fear of catching what they have. And the possibility that much more serious epidemics or pandemics could spread by air travel has been a worry for years, whether it is avian flu, Sars or tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we are in the middle of one of the deadliest outbreaks of Ebola virus ever: the outbreak started in Guinea last March and soon reached Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Concern in the West has heightened after it emerged that a man had flown on &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/30/ebola-outbreak-pan-african-airline-halts-flights-liberia-sierra-leone\"&gt;internal flights while carrying the virus&lt;/a&gt;, with fears growing that air travel could quickly carry the terrifying disease around the world. British Prime Minister David Cameron described Ebola as a &ldquo;serious threat&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023xzmb\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it to catch a deadly disease mid-flight, and what might stop a sick passenger carrying it between countries? To get a sense of the risks involved, BBC Future talked to infectious disease researchers to find out what we know about transmission during air travel &ndash; and what this can tell us about the risk of Ebola spreading across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmission problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks of catching an infection from an ill passenger are not as high as you would think, says Christine Pearson, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not any more dangerous than any place where you are in touch with lots of people &ndash; like a shopping mall food court for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary University, London, agrees. He points out that the aeroplane ventilation goes from the ground to the ceiling, where the air is filtered for bacteria and viruses before it recirculates. Simulations looking at the potential spread of germs have found that they are generally confined to just a &lt;a href=\"http://acer.eng.auburn.edu/partners/conf_papers/mazumdar_roomvent_2007_impact_moving_bodies_airflow_contaminant.pdf\"&gt;couple of rows either side of the carrier&lt;/a&gt;. Even then, the chances appear to be small, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. The paper looked at a flight involving nine school children who were later found to be carrying the swine flu virus. Just two other passengers, of more than 100 questioned, later developed the illness &ndash; and they were both sitting within two rows of the ill school kids. As a result, the researchers concluded that there was &lt;a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2424\"&gt;just a 3.5% risk of catching the illness if you were sitting in those seats&lt;/a&gt;. A handful of other studies, looking at &lt;a href=\"http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/189/Supplement_1/S81.short\"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893913001683\"&gt;TB&lt;/a&gt;, also suggest that in-flight transmission rates are similarly low. From studies such as these, Oxford says that &ldquo;the biggest risk is not on the plane, but in the taxi on the way to the airport&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, points out that it is difficult to come to any firm conclusions, even for the more prevalent diseases. The number of studies is small, he says, meaning you can&rsquo;t find absolute figures for the risk and compare that to the risk of infection in a school, say. So it is even harder to assess the risk of in-flight transmission of rare and unstudied diseases like Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023xztz\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mode of transmission is clearly a factor. There are a few documented cases of norovirus spreading among passengers &ndash; probably due to people sharing the same toilet. But we know that Ebola is relatively difficult to catch: unlike respiratory diseases like colds and flu, it can only be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids like saliva, vomit, or blood, which begins to secrete out of every orifice. Although it is unlikely that someone suffering the full-blown attack would attempt to fly, it is not impossible. Patrick Sawyer, a US citizen who died from the virus last week, showed some of these symptoms on a flight from Liberia to Nigeria, raising fears for the other passengers. Airline staff and public health officials should be more aware of the dangers now, however, and should place anyone suspected of having the disease in quarantine. &ldquo;Everyone is on the lookout,&rdquo; says Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always the chance that a passenger could board a flight before they have developed the full-blown symptoms. But so far, the evidence suggests you are unlikely to catch it from someone in the early stages of the disease, before they have started vomiting and bleeding. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a passenger next to a guy with Ebola,&rdquo; admits Edmunds. &ldquo;But if they are just sitting there with a fever, I can&rsquo;t imagine the situation being high risk.&rdquo; Oxford points out that basic hygiene measures should further reduce the chance of infection &ndash; even if it can&rsquo;t eliminate the danger completely. &ldquo;The Ebola virus is very easily killed; you can kill it with hot water and soap,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Alcohol rubs get rid of it in a microsecond.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Small risk&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If an apparently healthy person carrying the virus lands in a country, there is still room for a second stage of contagion. This is perhaps the greater risk for a global epidemic &ndash; undetected carriers are the way that swine flu and Sars spread across the world. &ldquo;The history of the spread of infectious diseases is infinitely entwined with improvements in travel,&rdquo; says Edmunds. He points out that in the past, the spread of diseases was limited by the length of travel; measles develops quickly, so all the cases would have burnt out by the end of a long voyage. Since Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days, carriers could arrive in a country weeks before symptoms develop &ndash; potentially transmitting it to the people they know. &ldquo;It is an issue,&rdquo; admits Oxford, but he is optimistic that the infection could still be contained. Anyone showing the symptoms would have a rapid diagnosis before being quarantined, and health authorities would also check anyone who had been in contact with them &ndash; such as air crews, passport officials and their families. &ldquo;All of that can stop it spreading &ndash; and it will be stopped.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023xzxt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the World Health Organization, Gregory H&auml;rtl, says its official stance currently is that a global epidemic is a &ldquo;small risk&rdquo;, although it is currently working with the International Air Transport Association to review their recommendations. Currently, &lt;a href=\"http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/\"&gt;it does not recommend screening passengers at airports&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; since the thermal scanners used to detect a fever are unlikely to find people incubating the first stages of the disease &ndash; and there are no recommended travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However; the situation is evolving fast and the recommendations may change in the coming days. At the moment, no one can yet predict whether other air travellers have been infected with the disease, but the hope is that heightened vigilance will help to minimise any potential risk. However, even if it is successfully contained and the outbreak peters out, Ebola shows, yet again, the fact that no disaster or epidemic is too distant in the highly-connected modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

At least, by some counts. While you are indeed made up of billions of human cells working in remarkable concert, these are easily outnumbered by &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120412-the-beasts-inside-you\"&gt;the bacterial cells that live on and in you&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; your microbiome. There are ten of them for every one of your own cells, and they add an extra two kilograms (4.4lbs) to your body.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from being freeloading passengers, many of these microbes actively help digest food and prevent infection. And now evidence is emerging that these tiny organisms may also have a profound impact on the brain too. They are a living augmentation of your body &ndash; and like any enhancement, this means they could, in principle, be upgraded. So, could you hack your microbiome to make yourself healthier, happier, and smarter too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to John Cryan, this isn&rsquo;t as far-fetched as it sounds. As a professor of anatomy and neuroscience at University College Cork, he specialises in the relationship between the brain and the gut. One of his early experiments showed the diversity of bacteria living in the gut was greatly diminished in mice suffering from early life stress. This finding inspired him to investigate the connection between the microbiome and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterial microbiota in the gut helps normal brain development, says Cryan. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have microbiota you have major changes in brain structure and function, and then also in behaviour.&rdquo; In a pioneering study, a Japanese research team showed that mice raised without any gut bacteria had an exaggerated physical response to stress, releasing more hormone than mice that had a full complement of bacteria. However, this effect could be reduced in bacteria-free mice by repopulating their gut with &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium infantis&lt;/em&gt;, one of the major symbiotic bacteria found in the gut. Cryan&rsquo;s team built on this finding, showing that this effect could be reproduced even in healthy mice. &ldquo;We took healthy mice and fed them &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; [another common gut bacteria), and we showed that these animals had a reduced stress response and reduced anxiety-related behaviours.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01slt3z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why should bacteria in the gut affect the brain? There are several different ways that messages can be sent from one organ to the other. It can be hormones or immune cells via the bloodstream, or by impulses along the vagus nerve, which stretches from the brain to intertwine closely with the gut. Through these pathways, actions in one produce effects in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how might you go about altering your microbiome to do a spot of brain-hacking? Cryan&rsquo;s team works on several fronts, investigating the potential to manage stress, pain, obesity and cognition through the gut. &ldquo;We have unpublished data showing that probiotics can enhance learning in animal models,&rdquo; he tells me. His team tested the effects of two strains of bacteria, finding that one improved cognition in mice. His team is now embarking on human trials, to see if healthy volunteers can have their cognitive abilities enhanced or modulated by tweaking the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another method of adjusting the bacterial profile of your gut is to undergo a transplant that involves taking faecal material from a donor&rsquo;s intestine &ndash; often a close relative &ndash; and implanting into a recipient via enema infusion. This unorthodox treatment has been shown to successfully treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria colonising the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain boost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Cryan has a far more appetising method on offer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Diet is perhaps the biggest factor in shaping the composition of the microbiome,&rdquo; he says. A study by University College Cork researchers &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7410/full/nature11319.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120809\"&gt;published in Nature in 2012&lt;/a&gt; followed 200 elderly people over the course of two years, as they transitioned into different environments such as nursing homes. The researchers found that their subjects&rsquo; health &ndash; frailty, cognition, and immune system &ndash; all correlated with their microbiome. From bacterial population alone, researchers could tell if a patient was a long-stay patient in a nursing home, or short-stay, or living in the general community. These changes were a direct reflection of their diet in these different environments. &ldquo;A diverse diet gives you a diverse microbiome that gives you a better health outcome,&rdquo; says Cryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a healthy and varied diet, though, it still remains to be discovered whether certain food combinations could alter the microbiome to produce a cognitive boost. In fact, Cryan recommends that claims from probiotic supplements of brain-boosting ought to be taken with a pinch of salt for now. &ldquo;Unless the studies have been done, one can assume they&rsquo;re not going to have any effect on mental health,&rdquo; he says. Still, he&rsquo;s optimistic about the future. &ldquo;The field right now is evolving very strongly and quickly. There&rsquo;s a lot of important research to be done. It&rsquo;s still early days.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacking the brain often conjures up ideas of electrical hardware such as implants and trans-cranial stimulators. But it might be the case that a simple change in diet can shift your brain up a gear. The transhumanists and body hackers who believe that technology is the sole way to improve human ability would do well to pay as much attention to the living augmentation that already resides in their gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-02-21T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Body bacteria: Can your gut bugs make you smarter?","HeadlineShort":"Can gut bugs make you smarter?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The bacteria in our guts can influence the working of the mind, says Frank Swain.

The Sumatran rhino had dropped too much weight over the summer. By December, she had stopped playing with her toys and became even more reclusive and lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly a decade, her keepers at Cincinnati Zoo had watched her grow. They had big plans for her. Suci, whose very name means &lsquo;sacred individual&rsquo; in Indonesian, was to be a saviour of her species. There are only around 100 Sumatran rhinos left, so a plan was hatched to mate Suci with her brother Harapan to increase their species&rsquo; count. But now, she had iron storage disease, a condition that also killed her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope that she would pull through came to an end one Sunday in March. Her keepers noticed that she was behaving oddly that day, so stayed with her into the night, and watched as she slipped away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who&rsquo;s tried as hard as we did to cure a rhino of this disease,&rdquo; says Terri Roth, director of the Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. But still, she says, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help but feel responsible that you were not able to save this animal.&rdquo; Suci, she explains, was one of the few promising females left for breeding. Others are too old or haven&rsquo;t been able to get pregnant. Even wild females are turning up infertile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Animals die, animals get injured,&rdquo; says Roth. &ldquo;But when you&rsquo;re down to 100, it&rsquo;s far more than an emotional loss.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ysfsm\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sumatran rhino is one of the world&rsquo;s rarest animals, but the bittersweet news is that we can at least identify that the species is in need of our help. For other endangered animals, it can be more difficult. Protecting the world&rsquo;s rarest species from extinction first requires identifying which creatures belong in this grim category. Yet answering this simple question can prove more difficult than it might seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, there is a difference between population numbers and conservation status, as reported by something like the &lt;a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\"&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature&rsquo;s (IUCN) Red List&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive database on the subject. In theory, conservation statuses are based on pure science, but in reality human subjectivity can come into play. &ldquo;The listings can be incredibly political, and very emotional,&rdquo; says Lisa Campbell, the Rachel Carson associate professor of marine affairs and policy at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina. Deciding whether to list an animal as critically endangered or just vulnerable could make or break funding for that creature, so there is a tendency to lean toward the direst possible listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01yslkr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, simply listing a species as critically endangered doesn&rsquo;t mean its rarity or chance of extinction is equal to all other creatures that share that status. Existing protection measures, types of threats, dispersal and genetic standings can all influence a species&rsquo; likelihood of actually kicking the extinction bucket. Numbers can vary widely, too. Critically endangered hawksbill turtles currently number in the thousands, whereas fewer than 100 critically endangered Seychelles sheath-tailed bats still exist in the world. &ldquo;One criticism is &lsquo;how can those be equivalent things?&rsquo; There&rsquo;s no good answer to that,&rdquo; Campbell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while no one is arguing that endangered species lists are bad things, if you want to identify the rarest animals on earth, it&rsquo;s better to go by absolute numbers alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01yshny\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, counting the total number of animals in a population can be easy. Researchers know every single remaining black stilt in New Zealand, for example. Those 27 birds are tagged and recognised like well-known friends. In other cases, it is straightforward to count the animals, such as by flying overhead to tally up African elephants. Often, though, they are stuck with less reliable methods of estimating population, such as analysing scat, counting nests or setting up camera traps. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of species where we know there&rsquo;s five, 20 or 100 individuals,&rdquo; says Mike Hoffman, senior scientific officer at the IUCN&rsquo;s species survival commission. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of others that we know are highly threatened and declining quickly, but we don&rsquo;t actually know what their exact population size is.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;So you can come up with a list of species that are perilously close to extinction,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be the complete list.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the species that we do know enough about to say are among the world&rsquo;s rarest include the Javan rhino, already extinct in mainland Southeast Asia and currently holding out with as few as 40 individuals; the Hainan gibbon, confined to a tiny patch of forest on China&rsquo;s rapidly developing Hainan island and numbering 23-25 individuals; and the Yangtze giant soft shell turtle, down to only four living individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ysggq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very rare species may also persist only in captivity. The Red List currently reports 32 such species. Those species &ndash; including the Kihansi spray toad, the Socorro dove, the Guam rail and the Hawaiian crow &ndash; are strong contenders for title of rarest animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, attempts to return these animals to the wild prove successful, as in the case of the black-footed ferret, the California condor, the Przewalski&rsquo;s horse and several others. While still listed as endangered, those animals are at least playing functional roles in their environments. In other cases, however, things don&rsquo;t go as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ysgbh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite best efforts, the species might not breed or survive well in captivity (as in the case of Suci), or there may just be too few individuals left. Such was the case for the Po&rsquo;o-uli, a handsome Hawaiian bird whose last known individual &ndash; a lone male for whom researchers never found a mate &ndash; died in captivity in 2004. &ldquo;That was it &ndash; the end of the species,&rdquo; Hoffman says. &ldquo;It was a case of too little, too late.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ysg40\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem with identifying the world&rsquo;s rarest animals is the difficulty often associated with seeking out the rarest of the rare. Exceptionally scarce animals can be so elusive that scientists sometimes lose track of them altogether. This might lead to their being declared extinct, only to reemerge years later. Recently, for example, the Hula painted frog &ndash; presumed extinct &ndash; hopped out of hiding in Israel after a more than 50-year hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prematurely declaring a species extinct can help push it over the edge to actual extinction. Budgets and conservation planning often revolve around a species presence or non-presence in an area. If it&rsquo;s listed as officially no longer existing, then no help will come for any lone holdouts. &ldquo;One of my colleagues here coined term &lsquo;the Romeo effect,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Stuart Butchart, head of science for BirdLife International. &ldquo;It means you give up on a species and stop trying to apply conservation measures, but it does still exist.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ysglr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this problem, scientists who determine conservation status listings are not quick to declare extinction, even if that might very well be the case. Miss Waldron&rsquo;s red colobus has not been spotted since 1978, for example, but it is still listed as critically endangered on the Red List, with the hope that a few of those animals might be hiding out in a remote corner of the Ivory Coast jungle. Likewise, BirdLife International estimates that one to seven Oahu alauahios still survive in Hawaii, despite none having been officially sighted since 1985. &ldquo;Some of these animals flagged as possibly extinct could very well be the world&rsquo;s rarest animals if they still exist,&rdquo; Hoffman says.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another flaw in the list of potential rarest animals on Earth is the fact that mammals, birds and reptiles dominate it. Invertebrates, fungi and many ocean-dwelling creatures are conspicuously missing simply because their global populations and conservation statuses have never been assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01yshz6\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IUCN has evaluated 71,576 species out of what some researchers estimate to be 8.7 million. The organisation plans to increase that count to 160,000 by 2020, but that&rsquo;s still just a fraction of the world&rsquo;s total biodiversity. &ldquo;Defining the rarest animal on the planet would imply surveying the entire potential distribution range of every single species, and being able to count every single individual &ndash; a formidable challenge,&rdquo; says Markus Gusset, chief conservation officer at the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the world&rsquo;s rarest creature could in fact be some ultra-obscure beetle whose jungle plot is currently being mowed down, or an unknown crustacean whose estuary home is quickly being drained. It&rsquo;s simply impossible to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news, however, is that conservation measures to protect better-studied species often benefit those the spotlight evades as well. According to BirdLife International, important bird areas, for example, fortuitously overlap with 80% of the areas identified as critical for amphibians, fish, invertebrates, plants and other life forms. This is where a species conservation status arguably becomes most important: as a tool for encouraging countries to step up and protect an endangered species before it is too late, and in so doing to also shield an entire ecosystem. &ldquo;We have the knowledge and the tools to protect these species,&rdquo; Butchart says. &ldquo;We just need to implement them.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-05-09T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Endangered species: The last animals of their kind","HeadlineShort":"Whats the worlds rarest animal?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"What are the rarest creatures in the world?

You desperately need a replacement. Every day, your family waits nervously for a call from the hospital to say they&rsquo;ve found a donor. Then one day, the call comes through. In your excitement you barely hear what the doctor on the other end of the line is telling you. There&rsquo;s something you should know, she says. The donor is not human. It&rsquo;s a pig.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That possibility crept a little closer last week, with the announcement that a pig&rsquo;s heart had survived over a year after it was transplanted to a baboon. The work, led by Dr Muhammad Mohuiddin at the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, supports the case of those who say that animal organs could be used to help humans on long transplant waiting lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such procedures would raise all sorts of thorny issues about what it will mean to be fully human in the future. If we can transplant pig hearts, then what other parts could we use to augment our bodies? And will taking non-human organs transform our relationship with animals, and even each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01yptsv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xenotransplantation &ndash; using animal tissues in humans &ndash; dates back to at least 1682, when Dutch surgeon Job Janszoon van Meekeren reported that a Russian soldier&rsquo;s skull had been repaired with a fragment of bone from a dog. Horrified church authorities ordered the removal of the graft, but it had healed too well to be removed. Later, Alexis Carrel&rsquo;s pioneering techniques for suturing blood vessels paved the way for the first xenotransplanted organs in 1902, but it took until the 1960s for any meaningful progress, when&lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/425120.stm\"&gt; surgeons had limited success transplanting primate organs to humans&lt;/a&gt;. However most failed within couple of months, and the patients died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, primates are no longer considered viable donors, due to issues such as disease transmission risk and the ethical considerations of primate research. What&rsquo;s more, the body would probably reject the organs. &ldquo;The major obstruction to xenotransplantation was the immunological rejection,&rdquo; says Mohuiddin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs, however, have proven to be better donors, at least in tests on baboons. A pig&rsquo;s heart is anatomically similar to a human, they pose less of a disease risk and the animals grow quickly, making them an excellent substitute. Crucially, by modifying a pig&rsquo;s genetics, Mohuiddin was able to render the transplanted hearts invisible to the baboon&rsquo;s immune system. Two genetic tweaks reduced the ability of the baboon&rsquo;s immune cells to identify the heart as a foreign body. A third added a gene that produces a human anti-clotting agent to help counter immune system reactions that can be triggered by blood clots forming around foreign tissue. Together, these changes allowed the heart to survive far longer than previous attempts.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ypty3\"}}&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So, what would a world with animal organ transplants in humans look like? Might we one day see farmers in overalls mucking out pens where pigs roll in the hay and oink happily as they grow a stock of organs inside them? Perhaps that doesn&rsquo;t seem too different from the situation we have now. We have after all been rearing pigs for their meat for thousands of years, and transplantable pig hearts will probably sell for a good deal more than they currently fetches as offal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a ready supply of compatible organs might open up unexpected demand for animal products. Medical interventions &ndash; even very extreme ones &ndash; have a habit of normalising once the costs and risks fall. Who would have thought that life-saving blood transfusions might one day be used by athletes to gain an edge on their competitors, or that surgery to repair the faces of disfigured soldiers would find its home in the opulent clinics of Beverly Hills, shoring up the faces of wealthy clients against wrinkles and sunspots?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can only speculate, breaking down the biological barriers that separate us from the beasts could lead to all kinds of elective procedures. As I wrote last month, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140407-the-people-with-animal-powers\"&gt;many people already covet &lsquo;animal powers&rsquo;, which they aim to acquire via technology&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, we might opt for cosmetic changes, and attach the oversized canines of wild animals to our teeth like the cyberpunks of William Gibson&rsquo;s novel Neuromancer. Alternatively, an athlete looking for a boost could switch her heart for something bigger, stronger, indefatigable &ndash; and maybe switch back again once her competitive days were over. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01ypyr6\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is perhaps more interesting to ask is whether elevating the humble porker to life-saving superhero will change people&rsquo;s relationship with the animal they are more used to seeing on their plates. Would you hesitate to sit down to a Sunday roast, knowing the pork on the table had the same heart beating in its chest as your great uncle? I put that question to Mohuiddin, but he declined to speculate on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, genetically augmenting pigs to make them more suitable as organ donors marks a small but important nudge toward them occupying some middle ground between food and friend. By expressing some of our genes, these pigs are, after all, very slightly human, and will become incrementally more so as the genes which present incompatibility issues are identified and swapped for human-tolerant ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one day we&rsquo;ll even go so far as to breed personalised pets that complement you perfectly, should you find yourself in sudden need of a heart, a kidney, or a liver. This ought to trouble our ethics far less than attempts to conceive a &lsquo;saviour sibling&rsquo; &ndash; a child born in order to provide life-saving tissue donations to a desperately ill brother or sister.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breeding the flesh of an animal to replace life-giving organs will undeniably change what these creatures are to us, and what it means to be &lsquo;fully&rsquo; human. You only have to listen to your own heart beating in your chest right now to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-05-08T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Would you accept a pigs heart?","HeadlineShort":"Could pig transplants save lives?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"If animal organs could be used to save our lives, will it mean we become a bit less human?

Turning his back on his privileged upbringing, Ridler tattooed his face and body in swirling patterns, took to wearing a large nose ring and stretched out his earlobes. Donning a costume of jewelled robes, he reinvented himself as Omi the Zebra Man and toured with circuses such as Barnum and Bailey, and Ripley&rsquo;s Odditorium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridler was just one in a long line of people who devoted themselves to taking on animal-like appeareances. The American Dennis Avner, better known as Stalking Cat or simply Cat Man, underwent over 14 surgical procedures to transform his face into a feline appearance, sculpting his cheeks, lips and eyes, and adding striped tattoos, whiskers and a set of needle-like teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for 20 years, the Leopard Man of Skye could be glimpsed living in a derelict stone cottage in the far north of Scotland, recognisable for his head-to-toe tattooed spots. Tom Leppard, as he is known to his friends, moved five years ago into a more comfortable home on the mainland at 73 years of age &ndash; not bad for a cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wzrrb\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few people would willingly transform their looks in such a way, and so these people gained celebrity status in their lifetime. Now, some prosthetics wearers, body hackers and amateur scientists are taking this to a different level&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;With technology and biology at their disposal they are aiming to mimic animal abilities &ndash; not their appearance &ndash; and they can already do things once thought impossible for humans.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some have been augmenting their physical abilities in places we haven&rsquo;t evolved to thrive, such as water. Nadya Vessey, for example, was born with a condition that prevented her legs developing properly. A few years ago, she had a mermaid tail designed that allows her to glide through the water like a dolphin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are turning to technology to sense a world that lies hidden to everybody else. Take, for instance, the invisible world of electromagnetic fields. Sharks have pits in their snout called the ampullae of Lorenzini with which they can sense disturbances in the electric field caused by their prey. Birds, lobsters and bees, meanwhile, are thought to sense magnetic fields, which some use to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sixth sense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, body modification artists have been experimenting with magnetic implants to achieve a similar &ldquo;sixth sense&rdquo;. By implanting tiny disc-shaped magnets in their fingers, they can feel the electromagnetic fields surrounding everyday technology. The falling price and wider availability of powerful neodymium magnets have made the procedure increasingly popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peyton Rowlands is one such enthusiast, a Texas-based biohacker who implanted a magnet into the ring finger of his left hand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel your finger getting pulled toward anything because the magnet is just so small,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;You feel a slight buzz once you get within a couple of inches of basically anything with electricity running through it.&rdquo; With the implant, Rowlands found he could detect the fields surrounding microwaves, refrigerators and power converters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very interesting sensation, kind of crazy. One of the things that I noticed is that DC current often felt similar to a ferrous metal or another magnet, a static bubble pushing or pulling against you, as opposed to AC currents which were much more like the kind of pins and needles feeling people describe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wzs1b\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Rowlands suffered a reaction to the magnet and had to remove it. This is a relatively common risk with implants, and they need to be coated with some kind of biocompatible material to avoid being expelled by the body. However, even these coatings can cause a reaction, as Rowlands discovered. He&rsquo;s currently searching for a more tissue-friendly alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaining an animal ability does not have to mean relying on technology. Daniel Kish lost his sight at the age of 13 months after suffering retinal blastoma, a form of cancer that affects the eyes. Within two months, his parents noticed he seemed to be able to navigate his environment and had a sense of what was around him. &ldquo;Echolocation is something I&rsquo;ve done for as long as I can remember,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The clicking of echolocation is used discreetly and strategically, so it isn&rsquo;t something that would necessarily be immediately obvious to my parents.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bat man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite on his own, Kish had learned to visualise the environment by clicking his tongue and listening to the reflected sounds. Echolocation is used by bats as well as cetaceans such as dolphins and whales to sense their environment. Kish identifies at least two kinds of echolocation he uses &ndash; the active clicking which he calls &ldquo;flash sonar&rdquo; (in reference to the illuminating flash of a camera), and passive echolocation which relies on paying careful attention to the acoustics of the immediate environment. Together, they form a small subset of the skills he uses to compensate for his lack of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a misconception out there that you have to be gifted to develop this skill,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I would say that&rsquo;s not true. You get ranges of ability, but it really has most to do with the motivation one has and the opportunity to implement the skill.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, others are already following Kish, such as Sam Oldridge, a British boy who was echolocating by the time he was eight years old (see video, below). And as president of World Access for the Blind, Kish runs workshops to teach blind students how to echolocate as well receive proper cane training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Blind-Boy-Sees-With-Sound-Echol\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The brain is a very interesting mechanism, a massive adaptive mechanism,&rdquo; says Kish. But admits it&rsquo;s very difficult for a sighted person to learn echolocation, because they lack the motivating necessity. &ldquo;Learning echolocation is much easier than learning a language, I know as I&rsquo;ve done both,&rdquo; Kish laughs. &ldquo;And like a language if you don&rsquo;t use it daily, you lose it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could sighted people train their eyes to see further, better, clearer? Rowlands thinks so. Working as a researcher with Science for the Masses, a group that works on open-access scientific research outside of any academic institution, he is embarking on a self-experiment programme to augment his own eyes to see into the infra-red spectrum through diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is in the biology of the eye. The human retina predominately uses the molecules photopsin and rhodopsin to perceive light, while freshwater fish such as the Mozambique tilapia employ a different molecule, porphyropsin. This grants the tilapia a much greater sensitivity to deep reds, and allows them to see into the near infra-red (NIR) spectrum. Rowlands hopes that by avoiding retinol (Vitamin A) &ndash; the vital nutrient needed to produce photopsin and rhodopsin, he can force the body into using its less-preferred molecule, porphyropsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As crazy as it sounds, the experiment is not without precedent. During World War II, the US Navy tried a similar procedure to give its signalmen NIR vision. The goal was to allow ships to communicate via infra-red semaphore lamps, which the enemy would not be able to see. However, the advent of infra-red goggles killed the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wzsmn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;With this exploit, I&rsquo;m not seeing in the thermal range,&rdquo; warns Rowlands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression we&rsquo;re talking about &lsquo;Predator vision&rsquo;&rdquo;. However, if successful, the augment will allow him to see more clearly, as NIR light has an easier time passing through smog and dust. &ldquo;I would have a longer range of vision, potentially I would see a lot further out on the horizon than anyone else,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The same thing goes for sunglasses and tinted car windows, I&rsquo;ll be able to see through these things a lot easier.&rdquo; Rowlands says he might also find he can see the lights emitted by security night cameras and TV remotes, and even see through certain clothing materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly the plan comes with risks. Withholding essential nutrients from the body can be harmful, which is why Rowlands and the other experimenters have designed a specially-designed nutrient shake containing supplements designed to counteract some of the risks. The fact that Rowlands&rsquo; group is working outside university science, without any of the usual qualifications, may raise some eyebrows. But he&rsquo;s determined to prove that science can exist outside of academia, by following the scientific method and using established experimental protocols. They&rsquo;ll find out if it works after a three-month-long trial, beginning soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s easy to look at the animal kingdom and feel in awe of the incredible feats on display. But both Rowlands and Kish warn that humans shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t pre-suppose restrictions on any individual,&rdquo; says Kish. &ldquo;Judging by the ease with which I can train someone to use a cane and flash sonar suggests that the ability is [already] there, it just needs to be activated. It&rsquo;s quite rusty, but it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no doubt that our brains provide us with imagination and innovation that no other creature can match &ndash; replicating unusual animal abilities might just be another of our resulting talents.

The Orgasmatron, patented by Dr Stuart Meloy, is a small box wired to the spine that can send out waves of pleasure signals whenever the user desires. Dig a little deeper though, and it turns out this technology has a strange and fascinating backstory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about the sixth or seventh reporter to call, and I&rsquo;m wondering what is going on,&rdquo; a perplexed Meloy told me. His confusion is justifiable. Recent news reports about the device are based exclusively on &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16922773.800-push-my-button.html#.UyxvB84YsyY\"&gt;a 13-year-old story in New Scientist magazine&lt;/a&gt; which recently appeared on web powerhouse Reddit, a user-curated repository of interesting things. In the long interim, Meloy has been trying to attract interest and funding for his device, without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meloy is a physician and co-founder of &lt;a href=\"http://aipainmanagement.com/\"&gt;Advanced Interventional Pain Management&lt;/a&gt;, a clinic that treats patients suffering from chronic pain. Through this centre, he began working with electronic implants. Attached to nerves in the spine, these devices send out continuous, low pulses to dull chronic pain. But following an operation to install an implant, one patient reported an unusual but not undesirable side effect: the device emitted intensely pleasurable sensations. Meloy realised that he had a powerful technology in his hands, one that he thought might be used to treat men and women suffering sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w12h5\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was over a decade ago, and while Meloy has enjoyed a successful career as a physician, progress on the Orgasmatron has stalled. One stumbling block is the generators used, which cost around $25,000. Meloy is confident that an Orgasmatron could get by on a much smaller power source, sufficient for about an hour&rsquo;s use per day. &ldquo;Pulsing constantly for days at a time is not, in my humble opinion, all that necessary to treat sexual dysfunction,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Some of us have to go to work.&rdquo; Unfortunately, no suitable alternative exists, and he hasn&rsquo;t been able to convince any medical manufacturers to design one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the issue of who pays for such an implant. &ldquo;Insurance companies will not pay for anything considered experimental or investigational,&rdquo; he explains. Although Meloy has fitted hundreds of patients with the devices for pain management (some of whom reported experiencing its famously positive side effect), implanting it specifically to treat sexual dysfunction would be a breach of regulations. Despite the headlines, the device still has not been shown to be an effective treatment for sexual dysfunction, and anyone thinking of faking a painful condition in order to get one risks disappointment. To get approval from the Food and Drug Administration, Meloy would have to carry out a &ldquo;pivotal trial&rdquo;, which would cost around $6m. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s money I don&rsquo;t have right now,&rdquo; he sighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleasure centre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely, Meloy isn&rsquo;t the first person to stumble upon the idea of installing a pleasure button in humans. In the 1950s, another US physician, named Robert Gabriel Heath, was treating psychological disorders at the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University in New Orleans. Heath wanted to develop something that was as effective as a lobotomy &ndash; still relatively common in that day &ndash; but was far less destructive. He achieved this with electrotherapy, using dentistry drills to cut tiny holes in the skulls his patients, through which thin metal probes were pushed, so that pulses of electricity could be administered directly to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heath discovered that by activating the septal region, he could induce a rush of pleasure that subdued violent behaviours in by some of his patients. And when given their own pleasure switch, patients were able to manage their mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient clocked up 1,500 doses in a three-hour period, but overall, they showed surprising restraint. (Unlike rats that underwent the same procedure, which self-administered to the point of exhaustion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reportedly, Heath&rsquo;s pleasure button earned him a visit from the CIA, who wanted to know if the technology could be used to inflict pain instead, to interrogate enemies of the state &ndash; or even control their minds. Heath threw the man out of his lab. &ldquo;If I wanted to be a spy, I&rsquo;d be a spy,&rdquo; he thundered to the New York Times in an interview. &ldquo;I wanted to be a doctor and practise medicine&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Heath&rsquo;s contemporaries, however, saw the wider implications of bringing human emotions to heel. &lt;a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-era-of-brai/\"&gt;Jose Manuel Rodriguez Delgado was another researcher who chanced upon the ability to manipulate pleasurable sensations in patient&rsquo;s brains&lt;/a&gt;. He also paired electronic brain stimulators with radio transceivers, effectively putting the subject under remote control. Famously, Delgado was so confident in his tech that he leapt into a bullring opposite one of his experimental animals. As the bull charged at him, Delgado was able to make it stop, bellow and turn it in circles with a flick of his remote (see video, below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jos-Delgado-implants-and-electr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the public mood surrounding brain implants soured with the publication of his book Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society in 1969, in which Delgado (somewhat naively) downplayed the Orwellian prospects of the devices and encouraged people to embrace the technology. If everyone would consent to implantation to mediate their tempers and traumas, the world would be a better place, he claimed. Two researchers he had briefly worked with raised an outcry the following year when they suggested the devices could be used to quell black citizens rioting in America&rsquo;s inner cities. Funding dried up, and with the advent of effective drugs to treat mental illnesses, electrical brain stimulation fell into obscurity &ndash; and with it, the joy boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Meloy is enthusiastic about the potential benefits of his devices, using them as a means of social control is &ldquo;not something I subscribe to&rdquo;. He is hopeful though that the renewed interest in the Orgasmatron might give it a second chance at becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were to happen, can we expect to see auxiliary pleasure buttons popping up on people&rsquo;s bodies? Not so fast, says Dr Petra Boynton, a sex researcher at University College London. &ldquo;I've yet to see a device, medication or product that provides significantly better outcomes than placebo for sexual problems,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned with the idea of offering a surgical intervention for cases that most probably would've done better with therapy, or information about sexual problems, options for pleasure, and how our bodies work.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the Orgasmatron does ever reach the market, consider that you already have a much more powerful electric joy box sitting on your shoulders. As for those who do decide to go the technological route, just make sure you know who is pushing your buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-24T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Orgasmatron: Strange tale of a pleasure implant","HeadlineShort":"Orgasms at the push of a button","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Pleasure-inducing implants can induce orgasms at the push of a button, but as Frank Swain discovers, theres a curious history behind this technology.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Pleasure-inducing implants can induce orgasms at the push of a button, but as Frank Swain discovers, theres a curious history behind this technology","SummaryShort":"The strange history of pleasure implants","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:29Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"863c4afc-d9ec-461e-8b56-418e08653efb","Id":"wwfuture/story/20140321-orgasms-at-the-push-of-a-button","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:29Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20140321-orgasms-at-the-push-of-a-button"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20140321-orgasms-at-the-push-of-a-button","_id":"559a562e0b808738c4e2f747"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;I have some startling news: you are not human. At least, by some counts. While you are indeed made up of billions of human cells working in remarkable concert, these are easily outnumbered by &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120412-the-beasts-inside-you\"&gt;the bacterial cells that live on and in you&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; your microbiome. There are ten of them for every one of your own cells, and they add an extra two kilograms (4.4lbs) to your body.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from being freeloading passengers, many of these microbes actively help digest food and prevent infection. And now evidence is emerging that these tiny organisms may also have a profound impact on the brain too. They are a living augmentation of your body &ndash; and like any enhancement, this means they could, in principle, be upgraded. So, could you hack your microbiome to make yourself healthier, happier, and smarter too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to John Cryan, this isn&rsquo;t as far-fetched as it sounds. As a professor of anatomy and neuroscience at University College Cork, he specialises in the relationship between the brain and the gut. One of his early experiments showed the diversity of bacteria living in the gut was greatly diminished in mice suffering from early life stress. This finding inspired him to investigate the connection between the microbiome and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterial microbiota in the gut helps normal brain development, says Cryan. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have microbiota you have major changes in brain structure and function, and then also in behaviour.&rdquo; In a pioneering study, a Japanese research team showed that mice raised without any gut bacteria had an exaggerated physical response to stress, releasing more hormone than mice that had a full complement of bacteria. However, this effect could be reduced in bacteria-free mice by repopulating their gut with &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium infantis&lt;/em&gt;, one of the major symbiotic bacteria found in the gut. Cryan&rsquo;s team built on this finding, showing that this effect could be reproduced even in healthy mice. &ldquo;We took healthy mice and fed them &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; [another common gut bacteria), and we showed that these animals had a reduced stress response and reduced anxiety-related behaviours.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01slt3z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why should bacteria in the gut affect the brain? There are several different ways that messages can be sent from one organ to the other. It can be hormones or immune cells via the bloodstream, or by impulses along the vagus nerve, which stretches from the brain to intertwine closely with the gut. Through these pathways, actions in one produce effects in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how might you go about altering your microbiome to do a spot of brain-hacking? Cryan&rsquo;s team works on several fronts, investigating the potential to manage stress, pain, obesity and cognition through the gut. &ldquo;We have unpublished data showing that probiotics can enhance learning in animal models,&rdquo; he tells me. His team tested the effects of two strains of bacteria, finding that one improved cognition in mice. His team is now embarking on human trials, to see if healthy volunteers can have their cognitive abilities enhanced or modulated by tweaking the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another method of adjusting the bacterial profile of your gut is to undergo a transplant that involves taking faecal material from a donor&rsquo;s intestine &ndash; often a close relative &ndash; and implanting into a recipient via enema infusion. This unorthodox treatment has been shown to successfully treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria colonising the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain boost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Cryan has a far more appetising method on offer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Diet is perhaps the biggest factor in shaping the composition of the microbiome,&rdquo; he says. A study by University College Cork researchers &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7410/full/nature11319.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120809\"&gt;published in Nature in 2012&lt;/a&gt; followed 200 elderly people over the course of two years, as they transitioned into different environments such as nursing homes. The researchers found that their subjects&rsquo; health &ndash; frailty, cognition, and immune system &ndash; all correlated with their microbiome. From bacterial population alone, researchers could tell if a patient was a long-stay patient in a nursing home, or short-stay, or living in the general community. These changes were a direct reflection of their diet in these different environments. &ldquo;A diverse diet gives you a diverse microbiome that gives you a better health outcome,&rdquo; says Cryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a healthy and varied diet, though, it still remains to be discovered whether certain food combinations could alter the microbiome to produce a cognitive boost. In fact, Cryan recommends that claims from probiotic supplements of brain-boosting ought to be taken with a pinch of salt for now. &ldquo;Unless the studies have been done, one can assume they&rsquo;re not going to have any effect on mental health,&rdquo; he says. Still, he&rsquo;s optimistic about the future. &ldquo;The field right now is evolving very strongly and quickly. There&rsquo;s a lot of important research to be done. It&rsquo;s still early days.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacking the brain often conjures up ideas of electrical hardware such as implants and trans-cranial stimulators. But it might be the case that a simple change in diet can shift your brain up a gear. The transhumanists and body hackers who believe that technology is the sole way to improve human ability would do well to pay as much attention to the living augmentation that already resides in their gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-02-21T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Body bacteria: Can your gut bugs make you smarter?","HeadlineShort":"Can gut bugs make you smarter?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The bacteria in our guts can influence the working of the mind, says Frank Swain.

In the clip above from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nt1st\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Hack My Hearing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Frank Swain meets an artist who created a unique device allowing him to hear colours. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I became a cyborg. At the time it didn&rsquo;t seem like an auspicious occasion, more a humbling and disorientating experience. But I&rsquo;ve become excited about being part-robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My journey began when my hearing started to falter, due to a combination of unlucky genetics and too many late nights in loud clubs. By the time I was 30, I was losing scraps of conversation in crowded bars, and trips to the movies were nothing but booms and rumbles. Eventually, I relented and booked an appointment with an audiologist, who recommended I be fitted with hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that decision, I joined the millions of people whose &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17153052\"&gt;mind, body or senses are replaced by technology&lt;/a&gt;, from wireless pacemakers to bionic legs. We live in the age of augmentation, and soon &lt;a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/amber_case_we_are_all_cyborgs_now.html\"&gt;we may all choose to be enhanced&lt;/a&gt; in some way. After all, many prosthetic technologies do more than just fill in for our body or mind when it falls short &ndash; they now offer the potential to become &ldquo;better than human&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was fitted with hearing aids, I wondered: could I hack them to give me enhanced listening abilities? I explored this question in a &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nt1st\"&gt;BBC radio documentary&lt;/a&gt; this week, and discovered that the answer is far from simple. It turns out I don&rsquo;t actually own my new ears in the way that I thought &ndash; and this raises important questions about many other augmenting technologies on the horizon, from retinal implants to bionic arms.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Unlike glasses, which simply focus the world through a lens, hearing aids take a very active role as an augment. They monitor the environment with their tiny microphones, constantly adjusting their output based on what they think is useful sound rather than noise. What I hear is their interpretation of the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means these augments offer a very exciting possibility, because I don&rsquo;t have to settle for hearing that is as good as an ordinary person. I could configure my own devices to extend my senses beyond normal abilities. I wouldn&rsquo;t be first to hope for such a thing either: artist Neil Harbisson, for example, has built &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01p6k4c\"&gt;devices that let him hear what colour sounds like&lt;/a&gt;. In my case, connecting my hearing aids to an internet-linked tool such as a smartphone, any conceivable information can be streamed directly to my hearing aids. Unlike your eyes, which can only focus on a single object, your ears are purpose-built to absorb huge amounts of complex information at once. My ears could be aware of the entire world, everything from approaching bad weather to levels of internet traffic around me. With the right app, instead of being hard of hearing, I could be superhuman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No tinkering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, supercharging my hearing aids is not just challenging, it&rsquo;s positively forbidden. During one fitting, I asked the technician calibrating them how I could adjust the settings myself, in case I found them too loud or too quiet for a particular environment. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; he exclaimed with some alarm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important they are only set up by a qualified audiologist.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He needn&rsquo;t have worried too much. Hearing aids are, by design, incredibly resistant to tinkering. Some have a button to switch between modes for different environments. Others &ndash; like my current pair &ndash; are entirely automated, relegating me a passive listener rather than an engaged user. Traditionally designed with elderly (and presumably technophobic) customers in mind, the emphasis for manufacturers has been on invisibility and ease of use, rather than fine control. All the same, manufacturers take a dim view of users fiddling with their own devices, and it&rsquo;s very difficult for anyone who isn&rsquo;t a certified audiologist to get their hands on the specialist programming equipment. Even the peripherals, such as additional microphones or Bluetooth adaptors, tend to come locked down in proprietary formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These restrictions raise an important question: exactly who owns my hearing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, any medical device implanted into the body becomes the property of that person, and even if it is subsequently removed it remains part of their estate. (Yes, in Britain you could, in theory, inherit your grandmother&rsquo;s hip replacement). However this rule doesn&rsquo;t include prosthetic devices offered by the National Health Service such as false limbs, which like crutches or a wheelchair must be returned if the patient no longer needs them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are a little more complicated in the US, where the ownership of medical implants is likely to be governed by a patient&rsquo;s contract with their insurer. But as a 2007 article in the Journal of Medical Ethics suggested, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598199/#!po=12.5000\"&gt;ownership does not necessarily mean sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;, stating &ldquo;by consenting to having an implantable device placed, the patient is indirectly giving up the right to autonomous control of the device.&rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Technically, my hearing aids are only on loan from the NHS. But these devices are a part of me, an extension of myself. So should health services &ndash; or even manufacturers &ndash; be allowed to control the abilities of devices that become part of a person&rsquo;s body? In becoming a cyborg, my body has become the locus of three different parties, each of whom have different priorities over how my cybernetic hearing should function. A combination of personal, health and business interests all go into a shaping something that will become part of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar restrictions will apply to those hoping to use other augmentations and technological implants in the future. We can expect serious legal, societal and ethical issues to be raised as these technologies become more common. For example, should there be a limit placed on how strong a bionic arm is? Should someone with retinal implants be allowed to record the people they meet? Is it okay for someone boosting their brainpower with magnetic pulses to beat other candidates in an exam or job interview?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers are unclear so far, but what&rsquo;s more certain is that humans will continually strive to enhance themselves and exploit technology to run faster, see further or think sharper. I&rsquo;m a cyborg, and soon you may be too &ndash; but don&rsquo;t assume the transformation will be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To hear more about designers and hackers augmenting their auditory abilities, listen to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nt1st\"&gt;BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s programme Hack My Hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Beyond human: How I became a cyborg","HeadlineShort":"How I became a cyborg","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"When writer Frank Swain joined the ranks of the cyborgs, he discovered that it meant losing control of a part of his body.

After losing his right leg in a motorbike accident in 2009, the keen athlete has built up a collection of 12 specialist prosthetics designed to do everything from mountain biking to snowboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metelka&rsquo;s first prosthetic leg was a basic model from the UK&rsquo;s National Health Service, which allowed him to stand and walk, but was &ldquo;nothing special&rdquo;. Then he met with specialists at Pace Rehabilitation in the UK, and his collection began to grow. The prostheticists at Pace began designing a suite of limbs to get him up and running &ndash; and skiing, and biking, and rollerblading. Each time Metelka suggested a new sport, the team designed a corresponding leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a prosthetic that performs in all situations with the skill and flexibility of a human limb is, at the moment, not possible. Instead, prosthetics are created with specific goals in mind. Each of Metelka&rsquo;s legs arrives with a particular design challenge. Weight, strength and durability must all be balanced, as well as considerations about the environment: water, mud, and ice. For downhill mountain biking, the engineers designed a leg that could pivot at the ankle and included a robust shock absorber that could endure the heavy drops down steep hillsides. By contrast, Metelka&rsquo;s road racing leg is a streamlined flute made from a single piece of carbon fibre, lightweight and very stiff. It was even tested in a wind tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metelka is not the only person to covet tailor-made prosthetics. In recent years, an abundance of specialised limbs have emerged, each as individual as the person using them. Farmer &lt;a href=\"http://modernfarmer.com/2014/01/future-farmer-prosthetics/\"&gt;David Blum created a special hard-wearing prosthetic leg&lt;/a&gt; that could meet the demands of his job, for example, and when motorsport champion Mike Shultz realised his prosthesis wouldn&rsquo;t stand up to the rigours of racing, he &lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/03/start/self-made-sportsman\"&gt;built his own leg out of bike parts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing something that performs on par with a living leg is no mean feat. While on a skiing trip, the freezing conditions caused the titanium bolt in Metelka&rsquo;s prosthetic to seize, and it had to be cut in two to release the socket and allow a different leg to be attached.&nbsp; But the challenge of building specialist limbs also comes with a certain freedom. Unlike natural limbs, there is no need to compromise for general use. While we can&rsquo;t build an all-purpose prosthetic as good as a regular limb, it&rsquo;s very possible to create specialised prosthetics that outperform flesh and blood in their particular category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do everything to the high level as a regular leg can,&rdquo; says Metelka. But for specialised legs, he admits that &ldquo;we are on the verge of building prosthetics that can outcompete natural limbs&rdquo;. Ahead of the 2012 Olympics, for example, &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13933-why-the-blade-runner-is-back-on-track.html#.UuDtCPvLdpg\"&gt;sport governing bodies and biomechanists &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13933-why-the-blade-runner-is-back-on-track.html#.UuDtCPvLdpg\"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt; whether the prosthetic legs worn by sprinter Oscar Pistorius gave him an unfair advantage against able-bodied athletes. Studies suggested they didn&rsquo;t, but in five years time, says Metelka, we might even see the emergence of particular sports where able-bodied athletes can no longer hold their own against those who can wear &ndash; and can afford &ndash; high tech prosthesis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out on a limb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Carter is another multiple prosthesis user, albeit with a more modest collection. Born without arms or legs, he owns three pairs of artificial legs, including a set of running blades, the kind made famous by Pistorius. &ldquo;My blades are designed for a very specific use: running. They are brilliant for what they are, but they&rsquo;re not practical to wear every day,&rdquo; he says. The carbon fibre blades act like springs, which means it&rsquo;s almost impossible to stand still while wearing them. He jokes that the continual hopping from one foot to another makes him look like he needs the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was young, hospital staff and occupation therapists gave Carter a dizzying array of different prosthetics, each designed for a particular task. &ldquo;I had a tool for everything you can imagine, undoing buttons, putting on trousers, eating, for everything. But as I grew up and got independent, it&rsquo;s another thing to carry them around. It was like being Robin Hood, having to carry around a quiver of various sticks and rods.&rdquo; Eventually, Carter decided that he&rsquo;d rather learn to do things himself than have to rely on a multitude of arms. Both he and Metelka talk about the need to plan ahead to ensure you have the right legs with you for whatever the day holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of improved materials such as titanium, carbon fibre and silicone rubber has opened up the world of prosthetics, allowing them to be made lighter, stronger, and better fitting. As well as specialising prosthetics for particular uses, it&rsquo;s also increasingly popular to customise general-use limbs: from ultra-realistic skins that include hair and tattoos, to more abstract forms. &ldquo;People tend to go two ways,&rdquo; says Carter, &ldquo;some want very realistic limbs, but many more are embracing the fact that they look different, and want to accentuate that fact.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undisputed queen of personalised prosthetics is Sophie de Oliveira Barata, who runs the Alternative Limb Project. Her studio has produced some of the most unique and eye-catching designs in the world, incorporating &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/03/magazine/03limbs_in.html\"&gt;scales, magnifying glasses, laser pointers, and ultra-realistic&lt;/a&gt; features such as freckles (see gallery). For the closing ceremony of the Paralympics, she crafted model Viktoria Modesta a baroque, jewelled leg decked with &lt;a href=\"http://www.thealternativelimbproject.com/#/crystallized-leg/4570775453\"&gt;crystals and mirrors&lt;/a&gt;. Even fashion designers are getting in the act &ndash; Alexander McQueen designer a pair of intricately carved &lt;a href=\"http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/tag/no-13/\"&gt;wooden legs for Paralympic athlete Aimee Mullins&lt;/a&gt;. Made without any joints, there weren&rsquo;t very practical &ndash; but that&rsquo;s hardly an unusual criticism for catwalk creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No prosthetic comes cheap. Currently running blades demand a cool $4,000 apiece, while Metelka&rsquo;s most hi-tech leg &ndash; a motorised walking foot &ndash; is an eye-watering $90,000. This high cost is the major issue for those wanting to specialise their limbs, says Carter. &ldquo;If money wasn&rsquo;t an issue I&rsquo;d get all the legs I could have,&rdquo; he laughs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be the Imelda Marcos of prosthetics.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Prosthetics: Meet the man with 13 legs","HeadlineShort":"The man with 13 legs","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"From robotic legs to laser arms, the owners of artificial limbs are no longer content with only one replacement, as Frank Swain discovers.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"From robotic legs to laser arms, the owners of artificial limbs are no longer content with only one replacement","SummaryShort":"Amazing limbs that do things you cant","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:24Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"237fe63a-faa0-4df9-80e8-03b4ff0066d5","Id":"wwfuture/story/20140123-the-man-with-13-legs","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:24Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20140123-the-man-with-13-legs"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20140123-the-man-with-13-legs","_id":"559a56290b808738c4e2f685"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;The first thing Lindsay Ess remembers after waking up from nearly 12 hours of surgery was being afraid to look at her hands. &ldquo;I called them the new hands,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;because they were still foreign, something new. I remember looking down and seeing purple nail polish on the thumb,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and I was suddenly even more aware of the fact that these belong to somebody who just passed away.&rdquo; Now, two-and-a-half years later, the hands are very much her own. But it hasn&rsquo;t been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess, who lost her hands to an infection, is the beneficiary of a futuristic surgical procedure. Only 70 people around the world have received a full new replacement hand. Ess is one of the few to have two. &ldquo;This is the first time in the history of body parts that we&rsquo;ve been able to restore body parts rather than reconstruct them,&rdquo; says Dr Scott Levin, Ess&rsquo;s surgeon and the director of the Penn Hand Transplant Program. So what&rsquo;s it like to be a recipient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand transplants are rare, and not everybody is a good candidate. Candidates have to go through a battery of tests to make sure that they&rsquo;re healthy enough to not only go through with the procedure, but stay on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives to ensure their body doesn&rsquo;t reject their new body parts. &ldquo;I can't even explain all the tests they did to me,&rdquo; Ess says, &ldquo;it was days and days.&rdquo; After a year of testing and preparing, Ess was cleared to go ahead with the transplant &ndash; and then she waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, in late September, a donor set of hands became available. Ess entered the operating room, and with the help of 12 surgeons emerged with a new pair of hands. The procedure requires doctors to reconnect bones, muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries and veins layer by layer, using microscopes to reattach the tiny pieces. First the bones are reattached, and then blood flow is established to the replacement limb by recoupling arteries and veins. After that, the tendons, nerves and skin are all reconnected. Microsurgery of this kind has been used for years to reattach fingers in emergency situations, but now doctors are using it in more controlled scenarios to reattach a whole arm. Twelve hours of delicate reattachment later, and Ess had two new hands. &ldquo;And then the hard work started,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w8h95\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess spent months in therapy &ndash; five hours a day of stretching, bending, reaching, and trying to encourage her own nerves and muscles to fuse and grow into the new hands. At first, her hand therapist simply moved her hands for her, as she tried to remember what it was like to move her own fingers. &ldquo;A lot of it is mental,&rdquo; Ess says, &ldquo;because your nerves have to regenerate, but your mind also has to regenerate the thought of moving your finger.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&rsquo;t until three months after her surgery that Ess could move her new hands at all. &ldquo;I raised my arms up, just to stretch, and I looked up and them and my right pointer finger and right middle finger moved a little bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I kind of freaked out. I thought it was a freak thing that one time, but I could do it again, and again. That might have been my first time when I was like &lsquo;wow, these are my hands&rsquo;.&rdquo; Today, two-and-a-half years after her transplant, Ess still goes to therapy once or twice a week for an hour-and-a-half. She&rsquo;ll probably go to therapy forever, she says, but it&rsquo;s worth it to regain control over her life. &ldquo;It takes a lot of persistence and diligence,&rdquo; to make this procedure successful, Ess says. &ldquo;You need a good fight inside of you.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w8h6z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the hands has transformed her life. &ldquo;I live by myself, I have a dog, I drive, I have normal stuff that I do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;These transplants may not be life saving, they are certainly quality-of-life altering,&rdquo; says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still things Ess can&rsquo;t quite do with her hands, like put her hair up behind her back, or rummage around in a full purse and pull something out without looking. &ldquo;Say I want to get a chip out of a bag, I can do that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chex_Mix\"&gt;Chex Mix&lt;/a&gt; I can&rsquo;t pick out my favourite, the pretzels.&rdquo; That will come with practice and therapy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess says she now sees the hands as her own. Some of that has to do with re-growing the crucial nerves from her body into her hands that allow her to bend and flex her fingers. And some of it is simply the time it takes for a body to adjust to a new addition, whether it&rsquo;s prosthetic or transplanted. Research has shown that the brain can integrate apparently foreign objects into our perceived body image. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729052.500-the-self-trick-yourself-into-an-outofbody-experience.html#.UzL83c4Yvms\"&gt;rubber hand illusion&lt;/a&gt;, where researchers manipulate an able-bodied person&rsquo;s sense of touch and perception to induce the feeling that a fake hand is their own (see video, below). For those with the new hand actually transplanted onto them, that feeling is even more convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"The-Rubber-Hand-Illusion-Horizo\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand transplants are probably never going to be the go-to option for everybody, says Levin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a trade-off. You have prostheses that break, or you have hand transplants that look and can feel normal, but you&rsquo;re taking medicine for the rest of your life to keep them from being rejected.&rdquo; Prosthetic technology is advancing alongside transplants too, and some day amputees will be able to choose between really good options to replace their lost limbs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the patient&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess says she still thinks about whoever donated their body parts and helped her live her life again. But apart from that hint of nail varnish when she woke up, Ess doesn&rsquo;t know anything about that person, and it&rsquo;s likely to stay that way. &ldquo;We are very cautious about not revealing the donor to the recipient,&rdquo; Levin says. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know anything, nor is it fair for a recipient to know anything.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything, Ess is grateful to her donor. She says her second thought after waking up from surgery was &ldquo;just being utterly thankful, that I survived and that somebody gave me such a gift,&rdquo; she says. And even though it&rsquo;s been hard, she&rsquo;s happy she did it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any regrets at all, not even one.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"I had a double hand transplant","HeadlineShort":"I had a double hand transplant","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Imagine looking down at your hands and seeing fingers that arent your own.

I remember looking down and seeing purple nail polish on the thumb,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and I was suddenly even more aware of the fact that these belong to somebody who just passed away.&rdquo; Now, two-and-a-half years later, the hands are very much her own. But it hasn&rsquo;t been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess, who lost her hands to an infection, is the beneficiary of a futuristic surgical procedure. Only 70 people around the world have received a full new replacement hand. Ess is one of the few to have two. &ldquo;This is the first time in the history of body parts that we&rsquo;ve been able to restore body parts rather than reconstruct them,&rdquo; says Dr Scott Levin, Ess&rsquo;s surgeon and the director of the Penn Hand Transplant Program. So what&rsquo;s it like to be a recipient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand transplants are rare, and not everybody is a good candidate. Candidates have to go through a battery of tests to make sure that they&rsquo;re healthy enough to not only go through with the procedure, but stay on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives to ensure their body doesn&rsquo;t reject their new body parts. &ldquo;I can't even explain all the tests they did to me,&rdquo; Ess says, &ldquo;it was days and days.&rdquo; After a year of testing and preparing, Ess was cleared to go ahead with the transplant &ndash; and then she waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, in late September, a donor set of hands became available. Ess entered the operating room, and with the help of 12 surgeons emerged with a new pair of hands. The procedure requires doctors to reconnect bones, muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries and veins layer by layer, using microscopes to reattach the tiny pieces. First the bones are reattached, and then blood flow is established to the replacement limb by recoupling arteries and veins. After that, the tendons, nerves and skin are all reconnected. Microsurgery of this kind has been used for years to reattach fingers in emergency situations, but now doctors are using it in more controlled scenarios to reattach a whole arm. Twelve hours of delicate reattachment later, and Ess had two new hands. &ldquo;And then the hard work started,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w8h95\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess spent months in therapy &ndash; five hours a day of stretching, bending, reaching, and trying to encourage her own nerves and muscles to fuse and grow into the new hands. At first, her hand therapist simply moved her hands for her, as she tried to remember what it was like to move her own fingers. &ldquo;A lot of it is mental,&rdquo; Ess says, &ldquo;because your nerves have to regenerate, but your mind also has to regenerate the thought of moving your finger.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&rsquo;t until three months after her surgery that Ess could move her new hands at all. &ldquo;I raised my arms up, just to stretch, and I looked up and them and my right pointer finger and right middle finger moved a little bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I kind of freaked out. I thought it was a freak thing that one time, but I could do it again, and again. That might have been my first time when I was like &lsquo;wow, these are my hands&rsquo;.&rdquo; Today, two-and-a-half years after her transplant, Ess still goes to therapy once or twice a week for an hour-and-a-half. She&rsquo;ll probably go to therapy forever, she says, but it&rsquo;s worth it to regain control over her life. &ldquo;It takes a lot of persistence and diligence,&rdquo; to make this procedure successful, Ess says. &ldquo;You need a good fight inside of you.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w8h6z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the hands has transformed her life. &ldquo;I live by myself, I have a dog, I drive, I have normal stuff that I do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;These transplants may not be life saving, they are certainly quality-of-life altering,&rdquo; says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still things Ess can&rsquo;t quite do with her hands, like put her hair up behind her back, or rummage around in a full purse and pull something out without looking. &ldquo;Say I want to get a chip out of a bag, I can do that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chex_Mix\"&gt;Chex Mix&lt;/a&gt; I can&rsquo;t pick out my favourite, the pretzels.&rdquo; That will come with practice and therapy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess says she now sees the hands as her own. Some of that has to do with re-growing the crucial nerves from her body into her hands that allow her to bend and flex her fingers. And some of it is simply the time it takes for a body to adjust to a new addition, whether it&rsquo;s prosthetic or transplanted. Research has shown that the brain can integrate apparently foreign objects into our perceived body image. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729052.500-the-self-trick-yourself-into-an-outofbody-experience.html#.UzL83c4Yvms\"&gt;rubber hand illusion&lt;/a&gt;, where researchers manipulate an able-bodied person&rsquo;s sense of touch and perception to induce the feeling that a fake hand is their own (see video, below). For those with the new hand actually transplanted onto them, that feeling is even more convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"The-Rubber-Hand-Illusion-Horizo\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand transplants are probably never going to be the go-to option for everybody, says Levin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a trade-off. You have prostheses that break, or you have hand transplants that look and can feel normal, but you&rsquo;re taking medicine for the rest of your life to keep them from being rejected.&rdquo; Prosthetic technology is advancing alongside transplants too, and some day amputees will be able to choose between really good options to replace their lost limbs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the patient&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess says she still thinks about whoever donated their body parts and helped her live her life again. But apart from that hint of nail varnish when she woke up, Ess doesn&rsquo;t know anything about that person, and it&rsquo;s likely to stay that way. &ldquo;We are very cautious about not revealing the donor to the recipient,&rdquo; Levin says. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know anything, nor is it fair for a recipient to know anything.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything, Ess is grateful to her donor. She says her second thought after waking up from surgery was &ldquo;just being utterly thankful, that I survived and that somebody gave me such a gift,&rdquo; she says. And even though it&rsquo;s been hard, she&rsquo;s happy she did it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any regrets at all, not even one.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"The people living the future today.

They strip each one down into a collection of screws, bolts, connectors, feet and other components. The prison workshop is home to a collaboration with &lt;a href=\"http://www.standingwithhope.com/\"&gt;Standing With Hope&lt;/a&gt;, a US charity based in Nashville, Tennessee that recycles unwanted prosthetic limbs for the developing world. The disassembled legs will be shipped to Ghana, where locally trained clinicians will rebuild them to fit patients there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These legs will get a second life, but other types of prosthetics and implants usually face a different destiny. What to do with augmented human parts when they are no longer needed &ndash; often due to the owner&rsquo;s death &ndash; is an increasingly common issue. Modern medicine offers a litany of replacement parts, from whole limbs to metal hips, shoulders and joints. Then there are pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), as well as more common augmentations like dentures and silicone breast implants. What happens to these augmentations when someone dies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tld5l\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inert devices such as breast implants and replacement hips tend not to be removed after death, largely because there&rsquo;s no compelling reason to do so, and they pose little threat to the environment. So it&rsquo;s likely that the archaeologists of future centuries will uncover peculiar objects in the graves of the millennial dead: silicone bags, plastic teeth and sculpted metal bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s a different story for cremation. In a furnace, silicone may burn up, but not the metal in implants &ndash; such as titanium or cobalt alloy. It is often separated from the ash and disposed of separately. Even tiny amounts of precious metals such as gold fillings can be discovered by waving a metal-detector over the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tlcr7\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, enterprising organisations have stepped in to recycle this material. Dutch company Orthometals, for example, collects 250 tonnes of metal every year from hundreds of crematoriums around Europe. At their facility in Steenbergen, it is sorted and melted down into ingots before being sold to the automobile and aeronautical industries. A similar US company, Implant Recycling, sells the melted and recast metals back into the medical industry. After you die, a little piece of you may one day end up in an aeroplane, a wind turbine, or even another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacemakers and ICDs, by contrast, are often taken out of the body after death &ndash; and almost always before cremation, because the batteries can explode when heated. The same goes for spinal cord stimulators that treat pain and some types of internal pumps for administering drugs, since they contain electronics too.&lt;br /&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Once removed, implants are typically discarded &ndash; both the European Union and the US, among others, have rules that forbid the reuse of implanted medical devices. However, there is a growing trend to recover them for use in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tlcvl\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $4,000 for a pacemaker and $20,000 for an ICD, a second-hand implant is the only way that millions of people will be able to afford this life-saving equipment. In the UK, charity &lt;a href=\"http://www.pace4life.org/\"&gt;Pace4Life&lt;/a&gt; collects functioning pacemakers from funeral parlours for use in India. In a similar effort, the journal Annals of Internal Medicine recently published the results of a US programme called Project My Heart Your Heart, which found that 75 patients who received second-hand ICDs showed no evidence of infection or malfunction. The group are now applying for FDA approval to send recycled heart devices overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Nashville, Standing With Hope has adopted a similar approach by shipping prosthetic limbs to Ghana. The charity&rsquo;s co-founder, Gracie Rosenberger, was badly injured in a traffic accident at 17, an incident which cost her both legs. Like many amputees, Gracie acquired a stockpile of prosthetics over the years, which made her wonder whether they could be put to better use. As limbs are replaced or outgrown, the old ones gather dust in the backs of closets. When an amputee passes away, the family are often left with a cache of working limbs but no one to take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The private insurers do not want it back, I don&rsquo;t even think Medicare wants it back,&rdquo; explains Rosenberger&rsquo;s husband Peter, who is president of Standing With Hope. &ldquo;There are all kinds of liabilities. So a lot of this stuff is discarded, unfortunately.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now amputees and their families can send old limbs in the mail to the Rosenbergers. When asking for donations, Standing With Hope&rsquo;s website reads: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not asking for an arm and a leg... just a leg&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tldc8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to beat last year&rsquo;s total of 500 replacement limbs delivered to Ghana. &ldquo;Last year I had a thing I called Operation Footloose, and on my radio show I would play the theme from Footloose and say &lsquo;turn that foot loose so we can recycle it&rsquo;,&rdquo; Peter laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like organ donors, those that bequeath their medical implants can bid farewell to the world with the knowledge they offer a stranger a second chance at life, be it a man with a heart defect in India, a woman undergoing a hip replacement in America, or a child with a missing limb in Ghana. And it&rsquo;s not just donors and recipients that have something to gain from the process. The Metro Davidson County Detention Facility is just a few minutes&rsquo; drive from Peter&rsquo;s home, and every so often he visits the inmates working in the limb disassembly workshop. As they chatted, one prisoner told Peter what the Standing With Hope project meant to him. &ldquo;He had tears in his eyes and said to me: &lsquo;I get to do something positive for the first time with my hands. I&rsquo;ve never done anything positive with my hands&rsquo;,&rdquo; Peter recalls. &ldquo;How rewarding is that?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"What happens to prosthetics and implants after you die?","HeadlineShort":"Body parts that live after death","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Millions of prosthetics, breast implants, and pacemakers now exist  so what happens to all these augmentations when their owners die or no longer need them?

After losing his right leg in a motorbike accident in 2009, the keen athlete has built up a collection of 12 specialist prosthetics designed to do everything from mountain biking to snowboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metelka&rsquo;s first prosthetic leg was a basic model from the UK&rsquo;s National Health Service, which allowed him to stand and walk, but was &ldquo;nothing special&rdquo;. Then he met with specialists at Pace Rehabilitation in the UK, and his collection began to grow. The prostheticists at Pace began designing a suite of limbs to get him up and running &ndash; and skiing, and biking, and rollerblading. Each time Metelka suggested a new sport, the team designed a corresponding leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a prosthetic that performs in all situations with the skill and flexibility of a human limb is, at the moment, not possible. Instead, prosthetics are created with specific goals in mind. Each of Metelka&rsquo;s legs arrives with a particular design challenge. Weight, strength and durability must all be balanced, as well as considerations about the environment: water, mud, and ice. For downhill mountain biking, the engineers designed a leg that could pivot at the ankle and included a robust shock absorber that could endure the heavy drops down steep hillsides. By contrast, Metelka&rsquo;s road racing leg is a streamlined flute made from a single piece of carbon fibre, lightweight and very stiff. It was even tested in a wind tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metelka is not the only person to covet tailor-made prosthetics. In recent years, an abundance of specialised limbs have emerged, each as individual as the person using them. Farmer &lt;a href=\"http://modernfarmer.com/2014/01/future-farmer-prosthetics/\"&gt;David Blum created a special hard-wearing prosthetic leg&lt;/a&gt; that could meet the demands of his job, for example, and when motorsport champion Mike Shultz realised his prosthesis wouldn&rsquo;t stand up to the rigours of racing, he &lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/03/start/self-made-sportsman\"&gt;built his own leg out of bike parts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing something that performs on par with a living leg is no mean feat. While on a skiing trip, the freezing conditions caused the titanium bolt in Metelka&rsquo;s prosthetic to seize, and it had to be cut in two to release the socket and allow a different leg to be attached.&nbsp; But the challenge of building specialist limbs also comes with a certain freedom. Unlike natural limbs, there is no need to compromise for general use. While we can&rsquo;t build an all-purpose prosthetic as good as a regular limb, it&rsquo;s very possible to create specialised prosthetics that outperform flesh and blood in their particular category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do everything to the high level as a regular leg can,&rdquo; says Metelka. But for specialised legs, he admits that &ldquo;we are on the verge of building prosthetics that can outcompete natural limbs&rdquo;. Ahead of the 2012 Olympics, for example, &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13933-why-the-blade-runner-is-back-on-track.html#.UuDtCPvLdpg\"&gt;sport governing bodies and biomechanists &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13933-why-the-blade-runner-is-back-on-track.html#.UuDtCPvLdpg\"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt; whether the prosthetic legs worn by sprinter Oscar Pistorius gave him an unfair advantage against able-bodied athletes. Studies suggested they didn&rsquo;t, but in five years time, says Metelka, we might even see the emergence of particular sports where able-bodied athletes can no longer hold their own against those who can wear &ndash; and can afford &ndash; high tech prosthesis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out on a limb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Carter is another multiple prosthesis user, albeit with a more modest collection. Born without arms or legs, he owns three pairs of artificial legs, including a set of running blades, the kind made famous by Pistorius. &ldquo;My blades are designed for a very specific use: running. They are brilliant for what they are, but they&rsquo;re not practical to wear every day,&rdquo; he says. The carbon fibre blades act like springs, which means it&rsquo;s almost impossible to stand still while wearing them. He jokes that the continual hopping from one foot to another makes him look like he needs the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was young, hospital staff and occupation therapists gave Carter a dizzying array of different prosthetics, each designed for a particular task. &ldquo;I had a tool for everything you can imagine, undoing buttons, putting on trousers, eating, for everything. But as I grew up and got independent, it&rsquo;s another thing to carry them around. It was like being Robin Hood, having to carry around a quiver of various sticks and rods.&rdquo; Eventually, Carter decided that he&rsquo;d rather learn to do things himself than have to rely on a multitude of arms. Both he and Metelka talk about the need to plan ahead to ensure you have the right legs with you for whatever the day holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of improved materials such as titanium, carbon fibre and silicone rubber has opened up the world of prosthetics, allowing them to be made lighter, stronger, and better fitting. As well as specialising prosthetics for particular uses, it&rsquo;s also increasingly popular to customise general-use limbs: from ultra-realistic skins that include hair and tattoos, to more abstract forms. &ldquo;People tend to go two ways,&rdquo; says Carter, &ldquo;some want very realistic limbs, but many more are embracing the fact that they look different, and want to accentuate that fact.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undisputed queen of personalised prosthetics is Sophie de Oliveira Barata, who runs the Alternative Limb Project. Her studio has produced some of the most unique and eye-catching designs in the world, incorporating &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/03/magazine/03limbs_in.html\"&gt;scales, magnifying glasses, laser pointers, and ultra-realistic&lt;/a&gt; features such as freckles (see gallery). For the closing ceremony of the Paralympics, she crafted model Viktoria Modesta a baroque, jewelled leg decked with &lt;a href=\"http://www.thealternativelimbproject.com/#/crystallized-leg/4570775453\"&gt;crystals and mirrors&lt;/a&gt;. Even fashion designers are getting in the act &ndash; Alexander McQueen designer a pair of intricately carved &lt;a href=\"http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/tag/no-13/\"&gt;wooden legs for Paralympic athlete Aimee Mullins&lt;/a&gt;. Made without any joints, there weren&rsquo;t very practical &ndash; but that&rsquo;s hardly an unusual criticism for catwalk creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No prosthetic comes cheap. Currently running blades demand a cool $4,000 apiece, while Metelka&rsquo;s most hi-tech leg &ndash; a motorised walking foot &ndash; is an eye-watering $90,000. This high cost is the major issue for those wanting to specialise their limbs, says Carter. &ldquo;If money wasn&rsquo;t an issue I&rsquo;d get all the legs I could have,&rdquo; he laughs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be the Imelda Marcos of prosthetics.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Prosthetics: Meet the man with 13 legs","HeadlineShort":"The man with 13 legs","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"From robotic legs to laser arms, the owners of artificial limbs are no longer content with only one replacement, as Frank Swain discovers.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"From robotic legs to laser arms, the owners of artificial limbs are no longer content with only one replacement","SummaryShort":"Amazing limbs that do things you cant","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:24Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"237fe63a-faa0-4df9-80e8-03b4ff0066d5","Id":"wwfuture/story/20140123-the-man-with-13-legs","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:24Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20140123-the-man-with-13-legs"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20140123-the-man-with-13-legs","_id":"559a56290b808738c4e2f685"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":[],"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"gallery","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I perched on the edge of my bed in a tiny flat, breathing in a cloud of acetone fumes, using a scalpel to pick at the corner of an electronic travel card. More than 10 million Londoners use these Oyster cards to ride the city&rsquo;s public transport network. I had decided to dissect mine. After letting the card sit in pink nail polish remover for a week, the plastic had softened enough that I could peel apart the layers. Buried inside was a tiny microchip attached to a fine copper wire: the radio frequency identification (RFID) chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal was to bury the chip under my skin, so that the machine barriers at the entrance to the Underground would fly open with a wave of my hand, as if I was some kind of technological wizard. But although I had the chip and an ex-Royal Marines medic willing to do the surgery, I failed to get my hands on the high-grade silicone I&rsquo;d need to coat the chip to prevent my body reacting against it. Since then, people have used the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BT6MU3gH80\"&gt;technique I helped popularise&lt;/a&gt; to put liberated Oyster chips in bracelets, rings, magic wands, even fruit, but the prize for first London transport cyborg is still up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who does will find themselves inducted into the community of &ldquo;grinders&rdquo; &ndash; hobbyists who modify their own body with technological improvements.&nbsp; Just as you might find petrol heads poring over an engine, or hackers tinkering away at software code, grinders dream up ways to tweak their own bodies. One of the most popular upgrades is to implant a microchip under the skin, usually in the soft webbing between the thumb and forefinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01rx8sd\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Amal Graafstra, a self-described &ldquo;adventure technologist&rdquo; and founder of biohacking company Dangerous Things in Seattle, Washington. He is a double implantee &ndash; he has a microchip in each hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his right hand is a re-writable chip, the same kind used in Oyster travel cards, which can be used to store small amounts of data. By pressing his hand to his phone, information can be downloaded from his body or uploaded into it. The left contains a simple identity number that can be scanned to unlock his front door, log into his computer or even start a motorbike (see video, below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"RFID-Enhanced-Motorcycle-Igniti\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month at the &lt;a href=\"http://brighterbrains.org/articles/entry/transhuman-visions-san-francisco-conference-tickets-on-sale-now\"&gt;Transhuman Visions&lt;/a&gt; conference in San Francisco, Graafstra set up an &ldquo;implantation station&rdquo; offering attendees the chance to be chipped at $50 a time. Using a large needle designed for microchipping pets, Graafstra injected a glass-coated RFID tag the size of a rice grain into each volunteer. By the end of the day Graafstra had created 15 new cyborgs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other people, though, the idea of implanting themselves with microchips may conjure up spectres of surveillance and totalitarian control. &ldquo;Every Hollywood movie has told them that implants are for tracking people,&rdquo; says Graafsta. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t get that it's the same exact technology as the card in your wallet. When someone uses a credit card, wireless or not, they are tracked because several other corporations know who they are, when they purchased, how much they spent, and where they spent it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet if that&rsquo;s true, what&rsquo;s the point of implanting it? Graafstra and his fellow cyborgs could just as easily use a chip inside plastic wallet to store data, and a key to open his front door or start a motorbike. &ldquo;Yes, basically you've taken an RFID access card normally stored in a pants pocket and moved it to a skin pocket,&rdquo; admits Graafstra. Still, there are some advantages: one benefit is that you&rsquo;ll never lose the chip, and it makes physical theft impossible &ndash; at least unless a thief is prepared for some gruesome surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graafsta also points out that embedding the chip under the skin reduces the distance that it can be read with a scanner, making it more secure.&nbsp; When it&rsquo;s in your arm or hand, there&rsquo;s less chance someone can surreptitiously scan your details, by sweeping a card reader nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01rzyn0\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, implanted microchips offer a way to make your physical body machine-readable. Currently, there is no single standard of communicating with the machines that underpin society &ndash; from building access panels to ATMs &ndash; but an endless diversity of identification systems: magnetic strips, passwords, PIN numbers, security questions, and dongles. All of these are attempts to bridge the divide between your digital and physical identity, and if you forget or lose them, you are suddenly cut off from your bank account, your gym, your ride home, your proof of ID, and more. An implanted chip, by contrast, could act as our universal identity token for navigating the machine-regulated world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet to work, such a chip would need to be truly universal and account for potential obsolescence. My own flirtation with implanted technology came to an end when I moved away from London, making an Oyster-equipped hand pointless. Even with a return to London on the cards, I&rsquo;m thinking twice about returning to my project, since Oyster cards are being phased out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a development may actually be a cause for optimism for implant enthusiasts, however, because instead of Oyster cards, London's transport authority is allowing people to ride the subways and buses using bank cards. It marks the beginnings of a slow move toward a world where everything will be accessed from a single RFID microchip. If that day comes, I can&rsquo;t think of a safer place to keep it than inside my own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;

Compared to most of the rest of the animal kingdom, the human face has at least one really peculiar feature: it's almost completely devoid of hair. Sure, some people grow beards or moustaches, but even a full pirate's beard would leave quite a bit of skin showing. They don't call us \"the hairless ape\" for nothing. How did we come to be so bare-faced?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons we lost our body hair are still debated. Some researchers think that we lost our fur to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/19/science/why-humans-and-their-fur-parted-ways.html\"&gt;free ourselves of parasites&lt;/a&gt;, such as lice. This might have made us more attractive to the opposite sex; bare skin would advertise our lack of parasites. Others have suggested that we lost most of our hair to &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00295.x/abstract?\"&gt;facilitate cooling&lt;/a&gt; as we moved from the shady forests to the hot savannah. Still others wonder whether nakedness is one of a number of juvenile traits that humans retain throughout their lifetimes; humans are thought to be, in one sense, juvenilised apes, who mature slower and live longer than our ape cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Mark Changizi, a neurobiologist at 2AI Labs in Boston, has an intriguing alternative explanation for why we don&rsquo;t have hair on our faces, at least when we compare ourselves to other primates. It's because we're walking, talking, breathing &lsquo;mood rings&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colour reveal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood rings were a short-lived fad of the mid 1970s. The idea behind wearing one was that it would act as a sort of emotional barometer, betraying your innermost feelings to anyone who took a glance at the jewellery. In truth, mood rings were little more than thermometers, designed to change colour according to body temperature. But the idea &ndash; that colour betrays emotion &ndash; isn't actually all that farfetched. The idea is pervasive in human culture. We become \"green with envy\". We turn red when angry or embarrassed. Sadness is referred to as \"the blues\". The truth may not be so far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027dfhn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changizi, together with researchers Qiong Zhang and Shinsuke Shimojo, argues that our &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618887/\"&gt;faces evolved their hairlessness to allow other members of our species the ability to read our emotions&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, primate faces and &ndash; in some cases &ndash; rumps and genitalia change colours thanks to the underlying physiology of the skin. \"For highly social animals like most primates, one of the most important kinds of objects to be competent at perceiving and discriminating is other members of one's own species,\" he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most mammals, like dogs, horses, or bears, can only see blends of two colours when they look at the world. They're called dichromats, and they can only see yellows, blues, or the greens that form when blue and yellow mix &ndash; in addition to perceiving brightness. That's because their eyes have, in addition to the brightness-sensing rods, only two types of cones: ones sensitive to short or long wavelengths of light. But humans and some other primates are trichromats. We have a third type of cone, sensitive to medium wavelengths of light. Having that third cone means that we can also detect colours along a red-green continuum. (&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision\"&gt;A few lucky people are tetrachromats&lt;/a&gt;, which means they can see even more shades).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's something odd about the three types of cones that trichromats have: they're not evenly spaced out. It just so happens that this odd assortment of cones allows our eyes to perceive properties of the blood circling through our bodies just beneath the skin: how saturated with oxygen the haemoglobin is, and how concentrated the haemoglobin is. Changes in those two variables result in predictable changes in skin colouration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's actually quite remarkable how many colours human skin can be. We're used to thinking of skin as being white, black, or brown. But those are just a baseline. Darker faces still blush, after all, something that even Darwin noticed. Skin appears redder as haemoglobin becomes more and more oxygenated. Reductions in oxygen saturation turn the skin green (which is just how veins carrying de-oxygenated blood back to the heart look). On the other hand, a greater accumulation of blood in a certain area turns the skin somewhat blue. Just like a bruise. And a reduction in blood concentration does the opposite, making the skin appear yellow. Which, indeed, is how we describe somebody who isn't looking very healthy. \"Colour is sufficiently suggestive of emotion,\" writes Changizi, \"that cartoons often use colour on a face to indicate emotional state.\" And it's something that even children can recognise effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027dfkh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dichromats &ndash; the dogs, bunnies, and bears of the world, along with certain primates &ndash; can only perceive changes along the blue-yellow dimension, allowing them to notice changes only in blood concentration. In some ways, that's a useful skill. It's probably best to avoid someone who looks yellow, to avoid becoming infected with whatever disease or sickness they're trying to fight off, or to escape being near someone who might imminently vomit. On the other hand, a bruise betrays injury, someone who will be easier to beat in a fight over resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the best part: if it's true that facial bare skin evolved to allow for colour signalling, then other trichromatic primates should have visible skin too. To see if his hypothesis held up, Changizi looked at 97 different primate species. Sure enough, he found that monochromatic and dichromatic primates are furry, while those, including us, who have three types of cones have more visible facial skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if bare skin was initially selected for something other than colour signalling, it is likely the case that both colour vision and visible skin became evolutionarily entangled, at least among primates, argues Changizi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time your friends ask you what you're feeling, just tell them to look at your skin. They should be able to figure it out: after all, they have millions of years of evolution on their side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"The mysteries of our bodies.

A few weeks ago, all that changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulton suffers from retinitis pigmentosa &ndash; a degenerative eye disease that slowly causes light-sensitive cells in the retina to die off. Over the course of several years she lost her sight, and for the past 10 years she hasn&rsquo;t been able to see anything at all. But in late July, Fulton was outfitted with a system called the Argus II. A pair of camera-equipped glasses are hooked up to electrodes implanted in her eyeball, which feed her brain visual information. Using the system, she can now see the world again. What&rsquo;s the experience like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When they &lsquo;turned me on&rsquo; so to speak it was absolutely the most breathtaking experience&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When they &lsquo;turned me on&rsquo; so to speak it was absolutely the most breathtaking experience,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was just so overwhelmed and so excited, my heart started beating so fast I had to put my hand on my chest because I thought it was going to pop.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both cameras and our understanding of the visual system improve, new techniques to restore sight to the blind are progressing too. Devices like the Argus II are able to bypass damaged eyes to restore some vision to those who have lost it. It&rsquo;s not the same as fully restored vision, and it&rsquo;s still early days &ndash; there are only six people in the US with the Argus II &ndash; but researchers hope that as they learn more about vision they can help those who&rsquo;ve lost it get it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0277gdn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Argus II system is made up of three parts: a pair of glasses, a converter box, and an electrode array. The glasses aren&rsquo;t corrective, they are simply a vehicle for the camera &ndash; and that camera is no more complicated than the versions found in modern smart phones. The image from the camera is then transmitted down into a converter box that can be carried in a purse or pocket. This box sends signals to the electrode array implanted onto the patient&rsquo;s retina. Essentially, what the Argus II does is skip over the cells that retinitis pigmentosa has killed to get visual signals to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Greenberg, the president and CEO of Second Sight, the company that developed Argus II, explains that the eye is like a multi-layer cake. On one layer are the light-sensitive cells, called &ldquo;rods&rdquo; and &ldquo;cones&rdquo;, that sighted people rely on to take in light and turn that into visual information. But for those with retinitis pigmentosa, those cells are dead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bypassing those dead cells and going to the next layer of the cake,&rdquo; Greenberg explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that Argus II has to convert the information from the camera into signals that the electrodes implanted in the eye can use, and that the brain can interpret. Figuring out how to achieve that was the focus of Greenberg&rsquo;s PhD thesis. But there was a bigger hurdle to come, he says: working out a way to implant electrodes onto the paper-thin retina inside the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0277hkn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The retina is like one-ply toilet paper,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Developing something that can sit on the surface of the retina without damaging it is really difficult. That was tougher than figuring out the algorithms.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients, though, the whole thing is remarkably simple. The surgery to implant the electrodes takes just a few hours and patients go home the same day with an implant that wraps around one of their eyes and is secured by a tiny tack the size of a human hair. After about a week to heal, the patient returns to get the glasses, to have their new electrodes tuned, and to train them on how to use the system. On the converter box there are knobs that let users increase or decrease things like the brightness and contrast. Then they go home with their new pair of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sight beyond sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do people using Argus II actually see? Greenberg says it&rsquo;s best imagined as looking like a pixelated image, or staring at a digital scoreboard held just in front of your eyes. There are regions of light and dark that collectively the brain recognises as an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulton, however, says it&rsquo;s difficult to describe exactly what she sees. &ldquo;People say you&rsquo;ll see shapes,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Well yeah but it&rsquo;s the electrical impulses, and it&rsquo;s about learning how to interpret them. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s just a learning curve. It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m learning.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0277h43\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulton says that mostly what she can see is areas of light and dark. She recently had dinner with friends. When they were leaving the restaurant she was able to hone in on a person&rsquo;s light shirt. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need to use a sighted guide, they were in front of me and I just followed them out,&rdquo; she says. Other patients report that things like fireworks and Christmas trees are especially visible. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for something to happen that I can go to fireworks, I haven&rsquo;t seen fireworks in a very long time and I am looking forward to that,&rdquo; Fran says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients, Fulton included, continue doing vision therapy to improve their sight and train their brain to better interpret the signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Fulton, who works as a disability advocate, getting around now is so much easier. &ldquo;The first time I left work with it &ndash; I work on the third floor and there are three elevators, and I heard the bell to go down. I lined myself up in front of the door and I walked straight in. I didn&rsquo;t bump my left shoulder, didn&rsquo;t bump my right shoulder, I didn&rsquo;t have to use my cane to check. Every day it&rsquo;s very exciting, and never in my lifetime did I ever think something like this could happen.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulton has long used a cane to detect obstacles in her way, but now her awareness of her surroundings is much more detailed. &ldquo;I am able to now identify doorways and objects on the street. I can&rsquo;t tell you whether it&rsquo;s a flowerpot or a homeless person collecting money, but I can tell you there&rsquo;s an object there.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argus II isn&rsquo;t perfect: it&rsquo;s only black and white, for starters. And it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re feeding a full image to the brain: users can&rsquo;t read signs, or recognise faces, or identify objects &ndash; at least, not usually. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been quite successful at identifying a triangle versus a circle and a square,&rdquo; Fran boasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s also important to note that this is not a system that all blind people can use &ndash; they have to have an intact retina for the implant to work. Those who lost their site to things like diabetes, glaucoma or infection and who have damage to the retina can&rsquo;t use the Argus II system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenberg says Second Sight is working on a new implant that bypasses even the retinal layer, and implants electrodes directly onto the visual region of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those who have been blind for years, simply seeing shapes again is pretty exciting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to being able to see my grandchildren,&rdquo; Fulton says. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to see their faces, but I know they&rsquo;ll have great fun standing in a room and say &lsquo;grandma find me!&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll be able to tell the difference between the four-year-old and the seven-year-old.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"I was blind now I have bionic eyes","HeadlineShort":"Im blind but I have bionic eyes","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"What is it like to see again after years of blindness?

Can you see the red on the edge of that leaf there?&rsquo;&rdquo; The students would all nod in agreement. It was only years later that she realised they were just too polite to tell the truth: the colours she saw so vividly were invisible to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, she knows that this is a symptom of a condition known as &ldquo;tetrachromacy&rdquo;. Thanks to a variation in a gene that influences the development of their retinas, people like Antico can see colours invisible to most of us. Consider a pebble pathway. What appears dull grey to you or me shines like a jeweller&rsquo;s display to Antico. &ldquo;The little stones jump out at me with oranges, yellows, greens, blues and pinks,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of shocked when I realise what other people aren&rsquo;t seeing.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetrachromats are rare enough, but Antico is particularly remarkable, since, as an artist, she is able to give us a rare view into that world. &ldquo;Her artwork might tap into a structure that all of us can appreciate,&rdquo; says Kimberly Jameson at the University of California, Irvine, &lt;a href=\"http://www.tenthousandthings.info\"&gt;who has studied Antico extensively&lt;/a&gt;. It&rsquo;s even possible that she might suggest ways for more people to see the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0267qts\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120209-do-we-all-see-the-same-colours\"&gt;whether we all see the same colours&lt;/a&gt; has a long history in philosophy and science. In the past, there seemed little reason to expect huge differences. We know that almost everyone has three types of &ldquo;cone cells&rdquo; in their retina that each respond to a different bandwidth of light. The colour of an object depends on the particular combination of those signals, but although the exact sensitivity may vary between people, overall one person&rsquo;s colours should roughly match another person&rsquo;s. The exceptions were thought to be colour-blind people, where one of the cones is faulty. With reduced sensitivity at certain wavelengths, they struggle to tell the difference between reds and greens, for instance.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, though, it could go the other way: according to some estimates, an extra cone would offer a hundred different variants to each colour that humans normally see. We know that this happens in nature: zebrafinches and goldfish both have a fourth cone that seems to help them differentiate apparently identical colours. About 20 years ago Gabriele Jordan at the University of Newcastle and John Mollon at the University of Cambridge proposed a way that it might be possible in humans too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of Jordan&rsquo;s argument lay in the fact that the gene for our red and green cone types lies on the X chromosome. Since women have two X chromosomes, they could potentially carry two different versions of the gene, each encoding for a cone that is sensitive to slightly different parts of the spectrum. In addition to the other two, unaffected cones, they would therefore have four in total &ndash; making them a &ldquo;tetrachromat&rdquo;. For these reasons, it&rsquo;s thought to be a condition exclusive to women, though researchers can&rsquo;t totally rule out the possibility that men may somehow inherit it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0267psg\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proving that these people actually see the world differently has involved a two-decade journey, however. Although the relevant combination of genes does not seem to be especially rare &ndash; perhaps 12% of women might have four distinct cones &ndash; many of the people that Jordan tested just didn&rsquo;t seem to show any differences in their perception. But by 2010, she had found a subject who perfectly acted the part of a tetrachromat. Jordan&rsquo;s &ldquo;acid test&rdquo; involved coloured discs showing different mixtures of pigment, such as a green made of yellow and blue. The mixtures were too subtle for most people to notice: almost all people would see the same shade of olive green, but each combination should give out a subtly different spectrum of light that would be perceptible to someone with a fourth cone. Sure enough, Jordan&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.journalofvision.org/content/10/8/12.full\"&gt;subject was able to differentiate between the different mixtures each time&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;When you ask them to discriminate between the two mixtures, a tetrachromat can do it very quickly. They don&rsquo;t hesitate,&rdquo; says Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0267pvz\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what do those colours actually look like? Unfortunately, Jordan&rsquo;s much-prized subject has not been available for media interviews. But once the abilities of the woman &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2012/jul-aug/06-humans-with-super-human-vision\"&gt;with super-human vision&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; became known, many more potential tetrachromats have come forward who might be able to give us an insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those was &lt;a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/tasting-the-universe/201310/dna-results-positive-tetrachromacy-0\"&gt;Maureen Seaberg&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist and author in New York who took the genetics test after hearing &lt;a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/\"&gt;Radiolab&rsquo;s podcast on the subject&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;I have always had polite disagreements with people about shades of colours,&rdquo; she says. When clothes shopping for instance, she often finds that apparently matching tops and skirts seem to be a different shade to her, clashing horribly &ndash; even though no one else seems to notice it. Her sensitivity can sometimes be baffling to those around: when helping to restore a house, she once rejected 32 paint samples before settling on the right shade. &ldquo;The beiges were too yellow and not blue enough, not cool enough; some of the almonds were too orangey,&rdquo; she says &ndash; distinctions that were much to the confusion of her building contractor. Of course, that is only anecdotal evidence, but it perhaps tells us a little about the way that apparently identical shades could appear strikingly different to a tetrachromat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antico has a similar story. She says she has always known that her eyes saw the world differently to other people &ndash; a talent that was soon noticed by her family. &ldquo;When I was a very little girl, my mother looked at me and said &lsquo;You are going to be an artist and art instructor&rsquo;.&rdquo; Today, Antico has fulfilled that prediction, with &lt;a href=\"http://concettaantico.com/\"&gt;her own gallery in San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she uses her enhanced vision to create vibrant paintings bursting with colour. Consider the following painting of a rainbow eucalyptus. &ldquo;The tubes of paint were flying. The yellows, the violets, the lime greens &ndash; I was ferociously mixing on the palette trying to produce all the streams of colour in the bark,&rdquo; says Antico. When compared to the real thing, the resulting canvas suggests that Antico is seeing more than the average eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0267p60\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was when looking at one of those paintings one day that a customer suggested that Antico contact some researchers who work on tetrachromacy. The genetics test came back positive, and she began collaborating on a series of experiments with Jameson and her colleagues, including Alissa Winkler at the University of Nevada, Reno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jameson immediately suspected the Antico&rsquo;s genes might also give her enhanced vision in dim lighting. &ldquo;If you look at her pictures of dawn, she paints a lot of colours and renders them in very low lighting,&rdquo; she says &ndash; conditions that normally reduce our vision to greyscale. That could just be creative licence, but Antico claims she is actually seeing the colours there in front of her. Sure enough, Jameson&rsquo;s experiments have shown that the luminance of different colours is indeed altered for Antico, making them pop out in the half light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0267p9k\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced sensitivity is not always a blessing, though. &ldquo;The grocery store is a nightmare,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a trash pile of colour coming in at every angle.&rdquo; That enhanced sensitivity might explain why she finds solace in plain white surfaces. &ldquo;People find that extraordinary that white is my favourite colour, but it makes sense because it is so peaceful and restful for my eyes. There is still a lot of colour in it, but it&rsquo;s not hurting me.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all tetrachromats have striking abilities. Jameson has found that Antico&rsquo;s perception outstrips other tetrochromats who have not trained artistically. &ldquo;Concetta is the perfect storm for tetrachromacy because she has a huge amount of perceptual learning experience by working with colour on a daily basis.&rdquo; If that is confirmed with further research, Antico hopes that she might be able to develop a training system to help all tetrachromatic children realise their potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antico&rsquo;s ultimate ambitions are even greater: to help us all see the world a little differently. Anecdotally, she says that a few of her students have started to notice some of the extra shades for themselves. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if a curtain is being lifted.&rdquo; Of course, without the genes, we can never achieve full tetrachromatic vision &ndash; but perhaps people like Antico can point out some differences that are just perceptible to our eyes, with training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly poignant issue for Antico. Thanks to the random draw of the genetic lottery, the particular gene variant that gave rise to her amazing vision has meant that her own daughter is colour blind. Perhaps one day, further research could suggest new ways to help everyone &ndash; including her daughter &ndash; to make the most of their colour vision, however limited. &ldquo;What if we tetrachromats can show the way to colour for people who are less fortunate than us?&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I want everyone to realise how beautiful the world is.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you see colours differently?

But it is perhaps significant that they chose a rich, red ochre &ndash; the colour of our blood and a vivid reminder of life, and death.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, shades of scarlet are linked with power, aggression, and sex &ndash; from the vermilion of the British Queen&rsquo;s royal regalia to the gaudy neon of Amsterdam&rsquo;s red&ndash;light district. And those associations may not be coincidence. A new branch of science called &ldquo;colour psychology&rdquo; has found that red can have a profound influence on our mood, perceptions and actions. Wearing red can even change your physiology and balance of hormones and alter your performance in a football match. So what is it about the shades of ruby, crimson, and scarlet that makes them so potent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning sign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that our perception of red coincides with one of the most important events in our evolutionary history. Many mammals, like dogs, fail to differentiate between red and green. But as our early primate ancestors were adapting to life in the jungle, they evolved a new kind of cell in their retina that allowed them to pick out the bright, red fruit from the foliage. That enhanced perception would then lend itself to new forms of social signalling. Red skin &ndash; caused by blood pumping near the surface of the skin &ndash; is an important sign of dominance for many primates. Mandrill monkeys are perhaps the most famous example, with vivid markings on their face and bottom that signal their position in the group&rsquo;s strict hierarchy; the fitter, and more dominant an individual is, the redder he appears. Reading their competitors&rsquo; fitness therefore prevents the lower ranking monkeys to take on a fight they are sure to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p025p2p2\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only in 2004 that two psychologists &ndash; Russell Hill and Robert Barton at the University of Durham &ndash; began to wonder whether humans might react in a similar way. Although we don&rsquo;t tend to flush a vivid, inflamed red like a mandrill, we do sometimes burn up with anger. So the sight of red clothes could perhaps carry associations of aggression and dominance. Hill and Barton were stuck for ways to investigate the idea, however, until the 2004 Olympics gave them the perfect opportunity. In combat sports like boxing and tae kwon do, the athletes were randomly assigned either red or blue kits, allowing the scientists to compare the same athletes&rsquo; performances when they were wearing different colours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p025p5ll\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking their progress throughout the games, Hill found that those assigned the red kits were about 5% more likely to win their bout than the blues. &ldquo;Simply wearing red doesn&rsquo;t turn you into an excellent competitor,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;But it helps tip the balance between winning and losing when people are fairly evenly matched.&rdquo; This first &ldquo;study in scarlet&rdquo; triggered a host of other experiments, finding similar results with football penalty shooters, for instance: they are less likely to score if the goalie is wearing red. &nbsp;Soon, colour psychology was a credible scientific field in its own right. &ldquo;That paper was really responsible for this resurgence in interest in colour and its possible effects,&rdquo; says Andrew Elliot at the University of Rochester in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact reason for these effects still remains a matter of debate. Elliot points to studies showing that people who wear red feel more dominant themselves, triggering an increased heart rate and testosterone boost that could improve their performance. Or the red might intimidate the competitor &ndash; in the same way that less dominant mandrills may avoid approaching their leaders with crimson faces. &ldquo;If you see red you&rsquo;ll feel fear and your lower status, and your testosterone will drop,&rdquo; says Elliot. Alternatively, it might have been down to the referees; one German team manipulated videos to change the kits of tae kwon do players before showing them to professional referees. &ldquo;Simply changing colours changed the way experienced referees were scoring bouts,&rdquo; Hill says &ndash; whoever was wearing red won the referee&rsquo;s favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Away from the sports hall, similar thought processes could lead to your downfall in a casino. &lt;a href=\"http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-08c502e5-9058-3ec5-99d3-e707ee05d495\"&gt;Playing with red poker chips seem to make people bet more than those using blue or white tiles&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps because they seem like the chips of winners. On the plus side, red clothes might also help you to perform better in an interview. Some fashion experts suggest &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140827-the-psychology-of-tie-colours\"&gt;red ties project authority and dominance in the workplace, as BBC Capital explained this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p025p551\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most studied effect concerns the shade&rsquo;s association with desire, seduction, and sin &ndash; a link that can be seen in everything from the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon\"&gt;Scarlet Whore of Babylon&lt;/a&gt; to Chris de Burgh&rsquo;s Lady in Red. A string of experiments, by Elliot and other colleagues, have all confirmed that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558822\"&gt;men and women are both rated as being more attractive when wearing red compared to other shades&lt;/a&gt;. Although many of the studies were conducted in the laboratory, with subjects passively rating static photos, it also seems to translate to real-world behaviour; &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120802111454.htm\"&gt;waitresses in red also tend to get bigger tips from male customers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance; &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01216.x/abstract\"&gt;wearing a red t-shirt can also increase female hitchhikers&rsquo; chances of getting a ride&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possible explanation is that slightly redder skin &ndash; thanks to a good circulation &ndash; seems to signal health and fitness; perhaps, by extension, we read the same from the clothes that we wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the sports results, the secret may lie in the mind of the wearer, as much as the eye of the beholder; in one clever experiment, researchers took mug shots of men and women wearing different clothes. The actual colours were not visible in the photographs, yet somehow, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22947805\"&gt;the judges still rated the people wearing red more highly&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;They might have put a sexier look on their face or held their posture in a more sexy way,&rdquo; says Elliot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p025p2qh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, you would do well not to immediately change your wardrobe or paint your office walls. In some contexts, red can provoke other emotions, sometimes undesirable. Perceptions of dominance may contribute to a man&rsquo;s attraction in the clothes he wears, for instance, but it could potentially backfire. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a super-bright red it might cue off aggression, which could be negative,&rdquo; says Elliot. And in the exam hall, he has found that &lt;a href=\"http://courseware.eduwest.com/courseware/0111/content/ziyuan/wenxian/01.pdf\"&gt;people perform worse on cognitive tests if they are given to the participant in a red cover slip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red herrings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, not all the findings of colour psychology are robust enough to be fully trusted just yet. &ldquo;I think the work is at a very early stage of development,&rdquo; says Elliot. The psychologists still need to replicate their results and investigate exactly when the different effects occur, so that we can be sure that the early findings aren&rsquo;t just red herrings. &ldquo;Eventually we might be able to use colour psychology to create a more productive working environment, but we&rsquo;re far from that point. I think it would tremendously premature to regulate what colour sports jerseys could be &ndash; or to outlaw red pens.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliot would also like to see more work investigating the rest of the rainbow. He has found that where red may hinder performance, green and blue can &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22427383\"&gt;encourage creativity in certain kinds of word games&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, Elliot suspects that their influence will be fairly limited, compared to the potent effect that red has over our behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The perception of red has evolved in such important events and experiences,&rdquo; says Elliot. &ldquo;Red is the colour of ripe fruit, the angry face across from you, the person showing sexual arousal.&rdquo; In this way, it will always be associated with survival, with connotations and influences that run as deep as the blood in our veins. Perhaps we are only confirming what our ancestors realised when they first started painting their bodies: there is no other colour like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"position: relative; display: block; width:100%; padding-bottom:110%\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/life_in_colour/\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;top:0;left:0;\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How the colour red warps the mind","HeadlineShort":"Red alert: A mind-warping colour","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Red is perhaps the most manipulative colour, influencing everything from your behaviour in the workplace to your love life.

I can point at the sky and say it is &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, and you will concur. But are you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; seeing that blue the way I am seeing it? Perhaps you have just learnt to call what you see \"blue\", but in actual experience you are seeing nothing like the vivid, rich, blue I see. You are an imposter, calling my blue by the same name as yours, but not really seeing it the way I do. Or, even worse, perhaps I am the one seeing a pale imitation blue, while &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; see a blue that is infinitely richer and more splendid than mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/31655696\"&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ky5n7\"}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/31655696\"&gt;What's behind the debate with #TheDress? BBC Newsbeat explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I admit that this worry lies in the realm of philosophy, not neuroscience. You might even ask me why I am worrying about this when we could be enjoying the glorious sunset. But when you think about it, it is not clear that I could ever have direct access to what it is like to be you, and you could never have direct access to what it is like to be me, or someone else, or some&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; else, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_it_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F\"&gt;such as a bat&lt;/a&gt;. My worry seems more plausible when you consider &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/colour_blindness.shtml\"&gt;colour blindness, which affects around 8% of men and half of one percent of women&lt;/a&gt;. Many people do not even realise they are colour blind. They live among the colour-seeing, getting by on the fact that there is usually some other difference between things of different colours that they can use to tell them apart, such as differences in shade or texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How green is my valley?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our colour vision starts with the sensors in the back of the eye that turn light information into electrical signals in the brain &ndash; neuroscientists call them photoreceptors. We have a number of different kinds of these, and most people have three different photoreceptors for coloured light. These are sensitive to blues, greens and reds respectively, and the information is combined to allow us to perceive the full range of colours. Most colour blind men have a weakness in the photoreceptors for green, so they lose a corresponding sensitivity to the shades of green that this variety helps to distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale, some people have a particularly heightenedsensitivity to colour. Scientists call these people &lt;a href=\"http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v040075\"&gt;tetrachromats&lt;/a&gt;, meaning &ldquo;four colours&rdquo;, after the four &ndash; rather than three &ndash; colour photoreceptors they possess. Birds and reptiles are tetrachromatic, and this is what allows them to see into the infrared and ultraviolet spectra. Human tetrachromats cannot see beyond the normal visible light spectrum, but instead have an extra photoreceptor that is most sensitive to colour in the scale between red and green, making them more sensitive to all colours within the normal human range. To these individuals, it is the rest of us who are colour blind, as while most of us would be unable to easily distinguish an exact shade of summer-grass-green from Spanish-lime-green, to a tetrachromat it would seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision\"&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0263325\"}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision\"&gt;The tetrachromat women with superhuman vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, as we share this sunset, perhaps I am seeing something you cannot see, or you are seeing something I cannot see. If our colour vision is wired differently, the information going in could be more or less the same between us. But as you tell me this, with the sun sinking slowly below the horizon, you can sense that it has not really helped with my true worry. I am worried &ndash; and perhaps you are too &ndash; that although we both have the same machinery in our eyes and we are both able to see the green of the trees, the red of the sun and the blue of the sky, that when I say \"blue\", it creates an inner experience that differs from yours when you say \"blue\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind blue eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My worry about your inner perception of the colour blue is a facet of the basic isolation that is part of the human condition. Even if we think we can really know other people, we cannot be certain of that knowledge. Historically, &lt;a href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviourism.html\"&gt;psychologists have adopted a stance called behaviourism&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as if questions about inner experience are irrelevant. This approach states that if you call my blue \"blue\", and you can always tell it from red, and if we both know it is the correct colour for the sky, my eyes and the Smurfs, then who cares what the inner experience is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of mileage in this perspective, but maybe there is also some wisdom in trying to convince ourselves that the difference between our inner experiences is real, and does matter &ndash; and, in fact, that some difference is inevitable. We use common words, and use them to refer to shared experiences, but nobody can see the same sunset, merely because perception is a property of the person, not of the sunset. Because there is something that it is like to be you, and your &ldquo;you-ness&rdquo; is unique, we are certainly seeing different things when we talk about looking at something blue, if only because the act of seeing incorporates feelings and memories, as well as the raw light information arriving at our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the sun has set and we walk away. You might be seeing a richer blue in the sunset than me, but you will not have the same memories of the other sunsets I have seen and the people I have watched them with. We could get our vision tested and find out who was better at perceiving colours, but we would never know what it was like to be the other person seeing a particular colour. As long as we can both say that it is a beautiful sunset, we can agree and be secure in the knowledge that I see my blue, and you see your blue, and although we may not see the exact same thing, we have shared it. And that sharing is itself unique to you and me, because no two other people in the world have the same two minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&rsquo;d like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-02-14T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Do we all see the same colours?","HeadlineShort":"Do we all see the same colours?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Are the colours you see the same as the ones I see?

It is one of the driest places in the world, and some sections of the Mars-like expanse can go 50 years without feeling a drop of rain. As poet Alonso de Ercilla put it in 1569: &ldquo;Towards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Atacama is not devoid of life. Microorganisms called endoliths have found a way to cling on, by hiding themselves inside the pores of rocks, where there&rsquo;s just enough water to survive. &ldquo;They support a whole community of organisms that eat the byproducts of their metabolism,&rdquo; says Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re all just sitting right there in the rocks &ndash; it&rsquo;s quite fascinating.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life, it seems, has an incredible knack for finding ways to persist. Indeed, microorganisms have been around for nearly four billion years, giving them ample time to adapt to some of the most extreme conditions in the natural world. But are there places left on Earth so harsh that they are rendered sterile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23kc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat is a good starting point for answering this question. The record for heat tolerance is currently held by a group of organisms called hyperthermophile methanogens, which thrive around the edges of hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. Some of these organisms can grow at &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10949.full.pdf\"&gt;temperatures of up to 122C&lt;/a&gt; (252F).&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most researchers believe that around 150C (302F) is the theoretical cut-off point for life, however. At that temperature proteins fall apart and chemical reactions cannot occur &ndash; a quirk of the biochemistry that life on Earth (so far as we know) abides by. This means that microorganisms can thrive around hydrothermal vents, but not directly within them, where temperatures can reach up to 464C (867F). The same is true for the interior of an active volcano on land. &ldquo;I really think temperature is the most hostile parameter,&rdquo; says Helena Santos, a microbial physiologist at the New University of Lisbon and president of the &lt;a href=\"http://extremophiles.org/\"&gt;International Society for Extremophiles&lt;/a&gt;. When things get hot enough, she says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible &ndash; everything is destroyed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23bt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure, by contrast, appears to be less of a problem for life. This means that heat rather than depth probably limits how far below the surface of the Earth life occurs. The centre of the Earth&rsquo;s 6,000C (10,800F) temperature certainly precludes all life, although the depth at which the cut-off occurs is still under investigation. One microorganism called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5899/275\"&gt;Desulforudis audaxviator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was discovered nearly two miles (3.2km) below the Earth&rsquo;s surface, in a South African gold mine. It has not been in contact with the surface for potentially millions of years, and survives by siphoning nutrients from rocks undergoing radioactive decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life exists at the other extreme, too, in subfreezing conditions. Bacteria in the genus &lt;em&gt;Psychrobacter &lt;/em&gt;can happily live below -10C (14F) in Siberian permafrost and Antarctic glacier mud. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html?_r=0\"&gt;Living cells recently turned up&lt;/a&gt; in a subglacial lake below the Antarctic ice. And Antarctica&rsquo;s hypersaline Deep Lake hosts unique &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/25/1307090110.abstract\"&gt;salt-loving species&lt;/a&gt;, even at -20C (-4F). To survive in these environments, microrganisms possess features such as specially adapted membranes and protein structures, and anti-freeze molecules within their cells. Given that the Earth has been covered in ice multiple times since life first evolved, &ldquo;an ice-covered lake in Antarctica does not seem all that extreme,&rdquo; says Jill Mikucki, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23nt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation typically does not deter microorganisms, either. So long as they are not in the direct pathway of an atomic blast &ndash; which would likely burn them up &ndash; they can thrive in containers of radioactive waste or near the epicentre of the Chernobyl disaster, for example. &lt;em&gt;Deinococcus radiodurans&lt;/em&gt;, one of the hardiest of the radio-resistant microorganisms, has &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109702009539\"&gt;survived trips into space&lt;/a&gt; and can endure radiation doses of up to 15,000 gray (the standard measure of the absorbed dose of radiation). For humans, just 5 gray causes death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, what we register as deadly chemical environments, some extremophiles call home sweet home. Various organisms depend on arsenic, mercury or other heavy metals for their growth and survival, while others prefer cyanide. In &lt;a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/kamchatka/\"&gt;the hot springs of Kamchatka in Russia&lt;/a&gt;, menageries of microorganisms metabolise using sulphur or carbon monoxide. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find a chemical that can kill all life,&rdquo; says Frank Robb, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might be isolated exceptions, however. Don Juan Pond in Antarctica is the saltiest known body of water on the planet, with salinity levels topping 40%. (The Dead Sea is around 33%). Researchers have recovered traces of microbial life from the pond, but they are still trying to determine whether it is actively growing and replicating there, or just blowing in from other locations. Don Juan counts as &ldquo;an example of a place on the surface of Earth where we might expect life, but cannot verify the presence of active life,&rdquo; says Corien Bakermans, a microbiologist at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, extreme heat and some synthetic laboratory environments might be the only sterile conditions on the planet&rsquo;s surface that it&rsquo;s possible to find zero traces of life. New organisms are regularly discovered that push the boundaries of life as we understand it, although where that line will ultimately be drawn remains unknown. As Santos says, &ldquo;What does not exist is more difficult to prove than what does exist.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there are some lone holdouts of sterility in the natural world, however, the environment exists in a constant state of flux &ndash; and if extremophiles teach us anything, it is that organisms are always capable of adapting. &ldquo;Give them enough time and they will find a way,&rdquo; says DiRuggiero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The last place on Earth without life","HeadlineShort":"Last place on Earth without life","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Weird and wonderful creatures can thrive in the most hostile parts on the planet, but there are a few places too harsh for even the hardiest, discovers Rachel Nuwer.

                Human beings have long believed that it is our unique level of intelligence that separates us from other animals. Our ability for higher learning, creative thought, and  perhaps most importantly  our sophisticated communication via speech and language, defines us as a superior species. However, as we expand our understanding of how the brain works, and use animal experiments to learn more about the genes involved in intelligence, will we reach a point where we can pull other species onto our intellectual plane?
               </p>
               <p>
                The idea of enhancing animal intelligence may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Consider a study published last month by Ann Graybiel and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about the relationship between intelligence and genes. The team
                <a href="https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/language-gene-0915">
                 genetically engineered mice to produce the human form of FOXP2
                </a>
                 a gene known to be linked to the human brain's capacity to learn and process speech  to see whether it would improve the rodents ability to learn. Sure enough, when the boosted mice were made to navigate a maze in order to get a reward of chocolate milk, they learned the route faster than the mice without the added human gene.
               </p>
               <p>
                The results are exciting for anyone interested in understanding the genetic changes in our prehistory that helped us become the wise  or sapient  ape. But the nature of this study speaks to another question: whether through fundamental alterations and improvements to mouse brains we could create sentient animals with levels of intelligence to rival our own  a concept known as uplifting.

                In the past, uplifting has been explored mainly in science fiction. One of this summer's biggest movies was Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which depicts a civilisation of intelligent primates descended from test subjects altered by scientists hoping to find a cure for Alzheimer's.
               </p>
               <p>
                And yet the movie has parallels with real research now under way. In 2011, a research team led by Sam Deadwyler of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, used
                <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/9/5/056012">
                 five rhesus monkeys
                </a>
                <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/9/5/056012">
                 to study the factors that lead people with diseases like Alzheimer
                </a>
                <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/9/5/056012">
                 s to lose control of their thought processes
                </a>
                . The researchers trained the monkeys in an intelligence task that involved learning and identifying images and symbols. They were then given doses of cocaine in order to dull their intelligence and made to repeat the test, with predictably less impressive results.
               </p>
               <p>
                What happened in the next stage of the research was remarkable. The same monkeys were fitted with neural prosthetics  brain implants designed to monitor and correct the functions of the neurons disabled by the cocaine. These implants successfully restored normal brain function to the monkeys when they were drugged  but crucially, if they were activated before the monkeys had been drugged, they improved the primates performance beyond their original test results. The aim of the experiments was to see whether neural prosthetics could theoretically be used to restore decision-making in humans who have suffered trauma or diseases such as Alzheimer's  but as far as these specific tests were concerned at least, the brain prosthetics appeared to make the monkeys smarter.

                All this means we may have already entered the era of animal uplifting, says George Dvorsky of the
                <a href="http://www.ieet.org/">
                 Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies
                </a>
                , a think tank that focuses on the implications of future technology. "But as for more substantive, impactful augmentations, that's still a way off, he says. The kind of uplift that appears in science fiction will require technologies far more advanced than anything we have today. This doesnt mean we wont eventually develop these technologies, he adds, particularly as they will primarily help us use animals to learn about cognitive problems in humans, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its an important point: even if the idea of uplifting may seem fantastical  and not the sort of goal we should be pursuing  the potential medical benefits in terms of combating human disease and injury suggest further progress down a path that leads to uplifting is inevitable. Certainly such manipulation of animals has advanced enough to become a serious matter to bio-ethicists: in 2011, the Academy of Medical Sciences in the UK reported on the ethics of research involving

                 animals containing human material
                </a>
                , and devoted an entire section to brain and cognitive manipulation.
               </p>
               <p>
                The matter has also become a passionate debate for theorists. Some, like Dvorsky, suggest that the debate should be pushed even further, beyond considering just the medical and scientific advances. He believes in an ethical imperative to uplift, arguing that if the technology is developed it should be shared with animals in order to free them from the anguish of 'survival of the fittest' as much as it is to free humans: "As the stewards of this planet, it is our moral imperative to not just remove ourselves from the Darwinian paradigm, but all the creatures on Earth as well. Our journey to a post-biological, post-Darwinian state will be a mutual one."

                For David Brin, a science fiction author whose novels helped popularise the concept of uplifting, the reasons to pursue the idea are slightly more pragmatic. He hopes that newly intelligent species would help us share the responsibility of protecting the environment. "The oceans of planet Earth are a vast mystery, filled with both physical wealth and unique treasures to preserve, he says. We are trying to learn to be good planetary managers, but I doubt we could fill that role all by ourselves, anywhere near as well as if sapient dolphin partners (and critics) were by our side. The same holds for countless other opportunities for both profit and wisdom."
               </p>
               <p>
                For others the whole idea is far more problematic. Paul Graham Raven, a researcher at the University of Sheffield, believes the pro-uplifting stance represents biological and scientific arrogance and a misguided belief in human superiority over nature, where human intelligence is viewed as the pinnacle of evolution.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is perhaps the biggest moral dilemma of the whole uplifting debate: even if Dvorsky, Brin, and others believe granting intelligence to other species would be for their benefit, Raven questions whether we possess the moral authority to make that decision for them without their consent. "It assumes we know what's best for species other than ourselves. Given we show little evidence of knowing what's best for our own species, I'm inclined to mistrust that assumption, however well intended," he says.
