     <strong>
      John
Dewey
     </strong>
    </em>
    (1859-1952) was an American psychologist, philosopher, educator,
social critic and political activist. He was born in Burlington, Vermont, on 20 October
1859. Dewey graduated from the University of Vermont in 1879, and received his PhD from
Johns Hopkins University in 1884. He started his career at the
    <a href="http://www.soe.umich.edu/dewey/index.html">
     University of Michigan
    </a>
    , teaching
there from

     1884
to 1888

    and

     1889-1894
    </a>
    , with a one year term at the University of Minnesota in 1888.
In 1894 he became the chairman of the department of philosophy, psychology, and pedagogy
at the
    <a href="http://www.pragmatism.org/genealogy/Chicago.htm">
     University of Chicago
    </a>
    .
In 1899, John Dewey was elected president of the American Psychological Association, and
in 1905 he became president of the American Philosophical Association. Dewey taught at
    <a href="http://www.pragmatism.org/genealogy/Columbia.htm">
     Columbia University
    </a>
    from 1905
until he retired in 1929, and occasionally taught as professor emeritus until 1939. During
his years at Columbia he traveled the world as a philosopher, social and political
theorist, and educational consultant. Among his major journeys are his lectures in Japan
and China from 1919 to 1921, his visit to Turkey in 1924 to recommend educational policy,
and a tour of schools in the USSR in 1928. Of course, Dewey never ignored American social
issues. He was outspoken on education, domestic and international politics, and numerous
social movements. Among the many concerns that attracted Dewey's support were women's
suffrage,

education
    </a>
    , educator's rights, the Humanistic movement, and world peace. Dewey died in
New York City on 1 June 1952.

       Dewey
    made seminal contributions to nearly every field and topic in philosophy and psychology.
    Besides his role as a primary originator of both functionalist and behaviorist psychology,
    Dewey was a major inspiration for several allied movements that have shaped 20th century
    thought, including empiricism, humanism, naturalism, contextualism, and process
    philosophy. For over 50 years Dewey was the voice for a liberal and progressive
    democracy that has shaped the destiny of America and the world.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dewey ranks with the greatest thinkers of this or any age on the subjects of pedagogy,
    philosophy of mind, epistemology, logic, philosophy of science, and social and
    political theory. His pragmatic approaches to ethics, aesthetics, and religion have also
    remained influential.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dewey's stature is assured as one of the 20th Century's premier philosophers, along
    with James, Bradley, Husserl, Russell, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Sartre, Carnap, and Quine.

       My person returns
    to unwind all its threads,
       <br/>
       Woven by language into the habits of heads;
       <br/>
       An old wearied head must bow down one final eve,
       <br/>
       But my lively thought shines in cloth I helped to weave.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your gift by my leave is but some seeds yet to grow,
       <br/>
       Whose value was found in times of need long ago;
       <br/>
       Sow all of these seeds in our vast garden with care,
       <br/>
       Protect and defend the greater harvest to share.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To view such swift change, see truths melt under new suns,
       <br/>
       To watch how scared souls kept on refining their guns;
       <br/>
       My nation was home despite such strife with no cease,
       <br/>
       My freedom was here while humbly searching for peace.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       By trial did I live, by more trial find my thoughts worth,
       <br/>
       My death you will get if you conceive no new birth;
       <br/>
       No life without doubt, for the best fail now and then,
       <br/>
       No rest for my faith, that each new day tests again.
