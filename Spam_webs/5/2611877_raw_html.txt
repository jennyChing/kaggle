       WTF is going on in this world. All these planes going poof and crashing and shit. Have you looked at some of the recent deaths in the last year? There are some important people that have died and no im not talking about celebrities cause come on if youcare if they live or die you wont get what im talking about. So the father of A.I.D. research and half his crew toast. The plague is back so there is that. Wars everywhere and yet where are our governments? Sitting in their cozy homes going on about their lives while these mishaps happen. Seems to me these things are happening too often and too planned. Scare tactics? maybe even the governments trying to get us to think we need them? Maybe they watched

       too many times and decided it was time to take turns being the game maker? When are people going to wake the hell up and realize our governments are no long trying to keep us safe they are the problem that is cause us trouble? Fuck all you bastards that collect a check working for our dictators. If you werent so damn worried about that check and cared more that you sold your sole to the devil himself. They are taking away your rights to feed yourself in michigan this week if you live in a community and they are just stomping all over the rest of our rights left and right and we all just stand back and take it. Everyone talks about kids needing to stand up to bullies yet Adults cant stand up to them either like #1 Bully of all time

           People that rant and rave about what you do like hes not doing the same. Since the author wrote the post on a computer (maybe a phone)..he owns one and I bet he googles too. People that own computers are either rich, or work to earn a check to pay for one (I suppose the library is a possibility too) AND since he has electricity I bet hes paying utilities too HMMMM. Hypocrite. Knowing how to grow food is one thing, quitting your job, not paying your bills and living under a bridge in protest (while the world nor the government knows or gives a shit) is another. Dont tell people there needs to be change and then expect them to know how. The average person doesnt give these things a single thought, surviving in this economy is hard enough..and so what if that is what the government wants. Change takes the ocean, not just one fish. So yea, Im going to work, Im going to pay my bills and Ill do what I can to make the world a better place when the opportunity arises. Stop pointing fingers and talking shit until youre doing shit or ready to take up a leadership position and show us how its done.

           You are missing the actual problem here. The real problem are the top 20+ capitalists who have the money and power, they control the governments, they contrl the world. The government is just there to take the fault so we miss the real problem the people behind it. If you want to solve a problem just think this: Who gets benefied with all this? and then you will see the source of the problem itself.
           <br/>
           We have been fooled for long, the people on the government come and go and most of them never make a diference. On the other hand capitalists and oil companies owners are always there, they dont have a dead line, they dont serve anyone; they are the ones we should worry about, they are the real power and they make the rules.

           Less talk more rock. Lets use some kind of sign language or code words that we change with the periodically recycling key components of the code so if it is detected there will be multiple ways to interperate the data. If that seems too complicated then at the very leastlets reprioritize our objectives. Spreading the message.not as important now as it was. They arent even really trying to hind their motives very carefully now. This is the sprint to the finish line people. They have been pacing the race for 3 centuries or longer. Now we should expect them to actually start flexing their muscles. We need to do more than that, because they have sucseeded in making us fat lazy medicated cowards with big mouths. In a straight conflict they will still win despite our overwhelming numbers because we are weak willed and easily manipulated. We need throw them off somehow by doing something they have failed to predict. If they claim agenda 21 will perserve the planet, sounds like bullshit but in the off chance that it is something they need, maybe we can grab their attention by presenting them with a global catastrophe that they didnt premeditate. like maybe we should take animals from around the world in their natural habitats and swap with them with animals in our neck of the woods. Lets let off a few random EMP bombs at landmarks they keep under high security. I dont know, lets just do something rather than writing this plan so the NSA can see it and identify all or most of us. Peace out.

           I am The Divine Chaos Angel 
          </p>
          <p>
           I have heard the cries from the planet ever since i could remember, I see the Darkness that blankets the world, i know the troubles and fears that lay in the hearts of men, I see the destruction being created, i Feel the the souls of those victims of Genocide. For Centuries The Human race has struggled within itself, allowing leaders to enslave and use them as they see fit. For Centuries the people have cried and screamed for Peace, Freedom and Equality. Many still sleep in blissful ignorance, but the Voices of those who have woken to the darkness around them echoes deep and loud throughout the cosmos.
          </p>
          <p>
           You search for an answer, you want simple things, you know the beauty of a simple life, you are a slave to tyrant who would happily see most of you dead, For as long as there has been tyrants and dictators that seek to enslave and destroy its people, there has also been those who rise in response to such brutal cruelties, they shout and warn the leaders LET MY PEOPLE GO
           <br/>
           Those who have woken to the darkness around them, do not fear, you are not alone, you are defended you are cared for and you are loved, but my message is far more complicated and important then that. For thousands of years the human race has been allowing itself to enslave itself, for thousands of years the human race and been destroying itself, first it was for land and resources, then it became about power then it transgressed into maintaining power, and money was formed. Now the Conflicts the human races creates is over this material known as money
          </p>
          <p>
           Money has been such a massive part of our lives for centuries, so long we have completely forgotten what it is like to be without the NEED for it , an almost perfect system of enslavement in which most do not even realise they are slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
           First be certain and except you are slave, you know nothing at all of the true meaning of freedom, you may think you do but you dont for neither you nor your ancestors have ever been FREE, yes its sad thought but i will share this with you
           <br/>
           The Longer it takes to grow a seed the better the fruit will be upon the tree
           <br/>
           Yes the human race has been waiting for such a long time for the best fruit to grow, but the waiting is over my family. I have risen to break through this darkness, and to guide you out of destruction and hate, I have risen to Guide you into Peace, Freedom and Equality.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now how am i going to do this you must be wondering, this is no 5 minute fix and full achievement will not be easy however it is completely possible. The answer has been staring some of you right in the face but youre not sure how to connect the dots. Thats where i will come in first let us review the situations the human race is facing at the moment:
          </p>
          <p>
           War  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
          </p>
          <p>
           Biological  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
           <br/>
           Slavery  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
           <br/>
           Poverty  Lack of Money
           <br/>
           Crime  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
           <br/>
           Hunger/Clean Drinking Water  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
           <br/>
           Government  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
           <br/>
           environmental  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
           <br/>
           inequality  Money/Religion/Nationalism/Land/Resources
          </p>
          <p>
           Have you noticed a pattern yet?
          </p>
          <p>
           Well just incase you havent noticed yet lets go through it in more detail.
           <br/>
           So What causes Technological/Biological/Mental Wars?
           <br/>
           it is well known that your government officials are nothing more than figure heads placed in their positions by bankers, It is also well know that these bankers are connected with occults but lets for not think about the secret clubs that these people are in, So basically War makes money, bankers are the only people who profit from a War these days,yes it should not be forgotten however that religion has also always been a creator and profiter of War, these days very few wars are fought to gain land or even resources for that matter, nationality is simply the accelerant used to spur the people into action.
          </p>
          <p>
           What causes Slavery?
           <br/>
           This is pretty simple, yes will still have old school in your face clapped in ions slavery in this day and age, however what must also be recognised as slavery is the Requirement to have to earn Money, in order to pay for basic essentials as well as luxuries now just for a second absorb that you are Forced to spend almost every day of your life working for a material in order to have a roof over your head and food in your stomach as well as energy needs, the requirement to have a little book labeling what your nationality is in order to be able to travel to another country. and of course religion has become very good at enslaving its people with the exact same things as mentioned above
          </p>
          <p>
           What causes Poverty?
           <br/>
           Well we all know what causes Poverty, this is obviously the lack of money
          </p>
          <p>
           What causes Crimes?
           <br/>
           Now think about as many laws as you can think of, i think you will find that a third of the laws we live by today are just unnecessary, and if you continue to think of them you will come to realise that more than 50% of all Crimes are caused by the lack or the need for Money or certain objects, and then they the remaining ones are crimes usually caused from religions, nationalities and personalities

           What causes environmental issues?
           <br/>
           Well some of these are made up, some are directly caused from government playing with weather machines, and some environmental issues such as landfills are created by people in general but a lot of them are just made up in order to squeeze every penny out of you
          </p>
          <p>
           What causes inequality?
           <br/>
           Inequality first and foremost inequality begins with status differences, which is caused by money, after status it is then religion/nationality/Personal opinion which is preventing Equality.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ok Now heres the part you have all been waiting for..How do we Fix these Issues?
           <br/>
           This wont be easy but it can be done and will be much more beneficial than the current systems we live in, you must see by now that currently our biggest problem is this material known as money, just like a tumour or virus, The monetary system must be abolished and forgotten about, i know how that sounds, at first to most you will be like WTF I dont want to give up my luxuries i dont want to live in the wild well you dont have to, but i will go into more detail about that in a moment, but first just try to imagine abolishing money all together.. if we was to do that then we need to think how are we going to get food shelter and so on? The people Provide to the people, if we could get rid of money, and all be sheltered and provided for with the basic necessities, then we are just left with the issue of religion and surely we live in a day and age where with the right teaching religions could become more accepting towards each other.
          </p>
          <p>
           How do we Abolish Money and still provide ourselves with the basics?
           <br/>
           Very good question indeed, there is a way, this may get a little confusing but ill try to keep it as straight forward as possible, so just try to stay with me. You believe in Peace, Freedom and Equality, you desire that for yourself and your family/friends and hopefully most of you desire this for everyone, if you agree to Peace, Freedom and Equality for Everyone across the earth, then we must declare ALL the worlds resources and lands as the common heritage of ALL people.
           <br/>
           If we declare that all land and resources that the world produces is the common heritage of all people then the people from across the world must come together and choose to build a FREE for ALL resource economy, a system which provides all of its people with Food/Water/Energy/Shelter + Luxuries all completely FREE for all people. I can feel a few of you thinking wtf am i talking about some of you think this can not be done but do not fear all the details you need will be available within this document. so allow me to continue friend. So basically with the system mentioned above and detailed below, we would in theory abolish the need for money while at the same time making poverty most crimes, most wars and Slavery almost entirely disappear simply because there would be no purpose to it any more, but not only that you would have taken away the reasons for politicians to turn corrupt, again if there is no money and all resources and land is equally shared by everyone then there less reasons for religions to conflict with each other. nationalism would be gone too. then whats left, the right education and knowledge will balance out the rest of the issues quicker then most would originally think.
          </p>
          <p>
           So lets plunge deeper into this detail.
          </p>
          <p>
           Declaring All Land and Resources to be common heritage of all people &amp; abolishing the Monetary system!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
           How do we Declare all land and resources to be common heritage &amp; abolish the Monetary system?
           <br/>
           There is 2 ways i know of that this can be achieved the first non violent way is first through a global petition, in which the majority of the worlds population would have to sign and agree to, after having the petition signed you will need government officials either in each country or the UN that will pass the petition through and declare such an act, this of course isnt easy for one person to do however with anonymous and the power of the internet surely this could be made a lot simpler.
          </p>
          <p>
           Option 2 is not as peaceful, it is to simply create chaos on the internet with in all countries allowing a selected team within each country to covertly enter all the worlds governments and from the inside take them down, this sadly is not a guaranteed success and could be very messy, option 1 is the ideal option as it doesnt require direct conflict to carry out.
          </p>
          <p>
           ok lets address a few doubts that some of you will be having about this idea.
          </p>
          <p>
           The usual questions are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
           If we do not use money and all needs are provided for by the people as a whole or the peoples government then who is going to do the jobs that are required?
           <br/>
           Why will people work if they have no reason to?
           <br/>
           Wont everyone just become lazy?
           <br/>
           Does this system mean no laws?
           <br/>
           Do we continue using the governments we have or do we start fresh?
           <br/>
           Do we need weapons? Do we need an Army?
           <br/>
           Are there Leaders? if so how many and who or how are they selected?
          </p>
          <p>
           It is true if we took away the need for money and the need for work they will most likly be a large hole in the workforce of the society however that is not an issue, we have the technology to be able to mechanise all most every job position, yes thats right i said mechanise the work force, but then you taking away peoples jobs oh wait nope as most of the jobs that would be mechanised most people will not want to do anyway, So why will people work or what will motivate them, well that depends on what you consider to be work, no longer would you have to spend hours on end worrying about a job you dont want to do so what does that mean, it means more time for you to follow your heart, more opportunities to really learn and do whatever it is your heart wants to do. Yes maybe some will not want to do anything however most people will choose naturally to want to stay active in some way or form, No this system does not mean there is not any laws at all but there will definitely be a massive amount of laws classed as unneeded, so we would have less laws and most people would just see no reason in committing a crime. As for the government personally i would advise starting a fresh government. After achieving this new system Weapons, armies they will no longer be required and should in my opinion all be dismantled and lost to the ages. The People must decide as a group whether to have leaders or not however i would advise that you do hold onto leaders but they should be selected from the people who are most vital for sustaining the main foundations of this system, such as farmers, engineers, robotics and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
           So if you are going to build a new government system let me provide the very beginning foundation of a government for the future

             thats quite close to my personal opinion, except i dont see any need for governments or laws at all. it seems like you have no idea of true freedom as well, and its for sure that our perception of freedom will change over time after our current system of control and oppression has been abandoned. that being said, while your plan would suit a big part of the population of our planet, some of us will not have the need for security and order. for them, your proposed system would be equally restricting as our current system is.
             <br/>
             my conclusion: the most important thing to know at the moment is that money/laws/oppression are not necessary to sustain living with our comfort standards (or even much higher ones), and that we could be truly free (whatever exactly that means for each of us). at this point, we dont need to worry about what will come after our current oppression, but how well come out of it.
             <br/>
             about your option 1: even if we could get lets say 4 billion people to sign such a petition, do you really think anything would change? they would fake the results, twist the meaning of the signed document or simply ignore it and shoot everyone who has signed the petition down. option 2 is already much more viable, but i am not sure whether i got the part destroy our governments from the inside right  if you mean to make some of us take important roles, and then just make a law that governments dont exist anymore, you are dreaming. it simply wont work out the way you imagine (there is a reason why this system survived this long. dont make the same mistakes as others). what we need to do, is building a communication system which is even more secure than tor-based chat clients, uninfiltratable by design, utilizing 3d-fraktal based encryption (or something equally complex &amp; secure), and employing advanced organization functions (eg. making up spec ops teams with extremely low chance of infiltration, independent from external circumstances). we need some sort of organized resistance, and we need it now.

           The deeper you dig, the more depressing it all seems that theres people out there with the power to do good or evil, people in a position to really make a difference for the greater common good, but they all choose not to. People in a position of power over others exploit that advantage almost always, Stanford prison experiment is testament to that notion. Hes right though, there are so many ways we can better our lives and survive without paying those whos greed knows no bounds. free energy inventions and solutions are all around us yet hardly utilized. We allow our children to go to schools whos funding is being cut yearly and given deplorable state mandated education and food, when we can take it I to our own hands as I have done and teach our own children, feed our own children. We can grow our own food, we have the technology and resources to grow an average family sized sustainable edible garden in our apartments, tow houses, etc. you need not have land to grow our own food. Those who are truly schooled on the subject know that women in labor do not need doctors, we were trained to think that. Then we were fooled and tricked by their labor domino effect starting with pitocin and the supine delivery position thus creating fetal stress and the need for medical intervention. People dont learn to question, and research,get a second opinion. Maternity care in America is a perfect example of how every other genre operates. Teach fear and doubt, induce fear and doubt, profit from fear and doubt.
           <br/>
           I guess it all boils down to human nature, to take the path of least resistance, but I like to call it  the path of perceived least resistance. Because to intelligent people, they know that taking matters I to your own hands IS the path of least resistance, but those who are lazy, ill educated, with no aspirations will roll over and continue the cycles that are bringing us down and tearing us apart.

           While there are many problems with our system of government and our economic system generalizing and stereotyping is a problem as well. A lot of people are doing what they can and should be commended for their contributions not vilified and those that arent well your not going to make many converts to the cause with dribble like this. I dislike it when the system plays the generalization game and I dislike even more when those supposedly working for change turn around and practice the deviseness of the very system that causes so much hatred and pain. If this sums up the year then you have blinders on and if you practice this naive and damaging approach to change then youre going to have a long wait until you see the fruits of your labor.

           You did not put them in power, you were just given the illusion of choice, the same as shown when the joker asked Harvey Dent. To end madness or to join its ranks but joker had his finger on the hammer of the revolver and even if Harvey dent had pulled the trigger, joker would not have died. The same illusion of choice was given to every citizen of every country, the governments are just pawns in the game of power, ever wonder how the huge corporation make billions and know exactly when which company is going to go up on stock or drop to its knees. The ZUES (It is the codename for the leader of the corporations involved processed by the CIA, MI6, ISI. And guess what?
           <br/>
           According to my sources MOSSAD had them all removed by capturing field agents and bargaining the Intel for themselves.) How do you think that every thing the movies present are coming to real life, because through the movies Intel and Clues are being transferred, but ended up being shown to the public. For example: The Hills Run Red was actually in encoded combat training manual for one of its field agents but before it could be delivered the truck was raided by THE LAND MAFIA and the disk was sold to a distributer, who made money but died in a car accident in a week after the release on silver screen. Every movie showed the future such as Rambo, in 2013 a Christian War veteran, Robert Stockholm, drove to Detroits largest mosques with explosives wired in his cars trunk. Luckily the bartender overheard Robert speaking to himself after drinking, saying that he was going to send some guys to heaven and the bartender informed the police, the bomb-squad took 3 hours to diffuse the military-grade explosive. The only thing keeping us alive is the Anonymous hackers and Pirate Bay, other then that I would say we are all sitting ducks. Let me give you another example Back to the Future II predicted that 2015 will have hover-boards, well you have your HENKO Hover board which looks exactly like the one used by Billy Jr., Lets take another example according to Elysium we will have full-body exo-suits in the distant future, well then how about the HAL-5 or did you know that the MARTIN-HEED TEAM and GOOGLE are together to create the Xo3 which looks exactly like the one in Elysium and EDGE OF TOMMOROW.

           Wake up and arm yourselves with heavy guns because within ten years the Apocalypse is coming.
