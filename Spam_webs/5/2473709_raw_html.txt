    <br/>
    By its nature, the Bill of Rights is (and was always intended to 
be) the highest law of the land, superseding every other regulation, 
law, statue, ordinance, decree, or amendment presently (or ever) put 
in force.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Bill of Rights is "true for all men and all times" -- meaning 
that it's as valid and necessary today as when it was written.
   </p>
   <p>
    While the body of the Constitution, as well as most subsequent 
amendments, function as a charter for strong central government that 
the Federalists insisted on, the price they willingly paid (the price 
demanded by Anti-Federalists) was not just a laundry list of things 
the government would generously allow people to do, but absolute 
prohibitions -- stringent limits -- imposed on what
    <i>
     government
    </i>
    would 
be allowed to do, written in plain language, meant to protect certain 
rights each of us possesses simply by virtue of being born a human 
being.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Bill of Rights is our property, collectively and individually, 
not the government's.  It may not be interpreted away, amended, or 
repealed, wholly or in part, without negating the entire Constitution 
from which government derives its authority.  In short, if the heirs 
of the Federalists renege (as they have with increasing frequency and 
brutality) on any part of their bargain with us, the heirs of the 
Anti-Federalists, then the whole deal is off.
   </p>
   <p>
    No Bill of Rights, no Constitution.
   </p>
   <p>
    No Constitution, no government.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the highest law of the land, the Bill of Rights must be
    <i>
     enforced
    </i>
    .  Any official, appointed or elected at any level of 
government and guilty of any violation of an individual's rights under 
the first ten Amendments, must be arrested, tried, and punished.  The 
highest -- the only -- priority of public officials must be to enforce 
the Bill of Rights, and that's the only criterion by which they should 
be judged.  The same "Bill of Rights Enforcement" policy would shut 
down all government activity, and nullify all laws and regulations, 
not specifically authorized under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to 
the Constitution.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyone who encounters (or professes to encounter) any difficulty 
understanding the meaning or intention of any portion of the Bill of 
Rights should ask himself the following question about America's 
Founders:
   </p>
   <p>
    You've just fought the most powerful and ruthless government on 
the planet for thirteen long, miserable years and finally (more or 
less to your surprise) won your independence.  The last thing in the 
world you want is to create another government just like the one you 
just defeated, or to fall again -- or let your children or 
grandchildren fall again -- under the boot-heel of tyranny.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now: what do
    <i>
     you
    </i>
    want the Bill of Rights to mean?
   </p>
   <p>
    Would you write a Second Amendment (for example) reserving the 
right to own and carry weapons to state governments and their 
militias -- rather than individuals?
   </p>
   <p>
    If you agree with the foregoing points, why not make yours
    <i>
     another
    </i>
    Bill of Rights Enforcement site?  The distinctive graphic of 
a parchment scroll -- representing the first ten amendments to the 
Constitution -- emerging from a broken Eurosocialist
    <i>
     "verboten"
    </i>
    sign, indicates you believe in and live by the principles expressed 
above.
