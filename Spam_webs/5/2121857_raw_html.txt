Nothing like waiting till the last minute. Some of the blurry shots were so you could not recognize the magazines which would have violated the rules. The clips were all shot with a Canon 7D with a cheap 50MM lens. For $100 dollars new, this lens is a bargain. All settings were on manual.

Includes a wee bit of unenlightened &quot;man on the street&quot; comments at around the 9-minute mark, and lady nipples at about 12 minutes in (on the cover of an Adipositivity calendar--at Re/DressNYC--with a hilarious note attached). Also some unfortunate thin-shaming at 15:40 on the part of the thin reporter, who was otherwise quite able and respectful. And of course a fair amount of &quot;be a classy lady&quot; nonsense. Includes Gwen DeVoe, Glenn Marla, designer Rachel Kacenjar, and Shonda Freeman.

It seeks to both address existing issues of sexism within the mainstream porn industry as well as create new spaces and paradigms for pornography that challenge mainstream tropes. It also strives to create fair and favorable working conditions for performers. Through these many changes, feminists relationship with porn has shifted from battles over what pornography reveals about structures of power to experiments in what pornography can change in structures of power.\r\n\r\nPornography has become the way that people learn about sex. It has become the new sex education, as actual sex-ed is scarce and highly limited. By depicting authentic, non-scripted, diverse representations of men, women, and genderqueer people, feminist pornography has the potential to sexually educate and sexually reorient the public and thus revolutionize sexual relationships.\r\n\r\nOlivia Tarplin is a Jersey City native who received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Global Studies with a concentration in Gender and Media Studies from The New School in 2014. Her research has centered around issues of gender, politics, sexuality, media, and specifically pornography. Focusing on the thriving industry of feminist pornography, she has spent the past 2 years studying how experiments in feminist porn can change the widespread sexual culture and how porn made ethically can act as a new and improved way to educate the masses about sex. In keeping with these interests, during her time in college she co-designed new and innovative ways to teach sex-positive sex/health education, and implemented these strategies by leading sex education workshops in Freshmen classrooms around campus. She currently works in New York City in the non-profit world.","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"250070825","posted":"2015-03-30 16:59:37","pipeline_xid":"x38-iHvUqLY","synced":"2015-05-13 13:08:07","poster":"TEDxTalks","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x38-iHvUqLY/hqdefault.jpg","description":"Feminist pornography has evolved from its beginnings of female porn icons and sex-positive academic feminists.

This performers immersion in the New York Burlesque scene and her resulting paradigm shift inspired her to delve into ways women can experience their own bodies in new and affirming ways. In this talk, Lillian discusses self-esteem, risk-taking, and diversity, and offers practical techniques for destroying self-negativity\r\n\r\nLillian Bustle is an actor, singer, burlesque performer, and gleeful loudmouth about body love.

This is a tall order. I'll get to the end of a great piece, only to find there's a wildly false statement or an otherwise problematic message. Those videos don't make my cut. Except for this one.\r\n\r\nIt's made for educators, and it's brilliant and necessary. At 5:26 there's what appears to be an great body positivity book list for kids. (I've added 'em to my holiday gift list.) HOWEVER. The audio features a song that's currently heralded as being a body positive song, but is actually disturbingly body-shaming in both it's skinny-bitch-isms and its prescription of what's required to have the \"right\" body. I realize my opinions on this song run counter to those of most of my contemporaries, even amongst many of my fellow body politics activists. That doesn't make the song any less body-shaming.\r\n\r\nSo. Here's what I suggest to you. When the song begins, mute it, then unmute it when you see the kids being interviewed. You're safe from that point on. I didn't wanna throw this baby out with the bathwater. It's too good not to share, just because of the misguided inclusion of a song that's perhaps not entirely understood.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n~Substantia Jones, Your Body Image Video Curator\r\n","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"244797895","posted":"2014-11-09 18:40:03","pipeline_xid":"111367926","synced":"2014-11-10 07:48:02","poster":"Katelynn Roman","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/495958197_1280.jpg","description":"","license":null,"media_equivalence_nid":null,"tags":"","duration_seconds":"351","format_info":null,"media_pipeline_cid":"vimeo","source_href":"http://vimeo.com/111367926","title":"Body Image in Children","cid":"RR53R11F53YSVRZZ"},"approved":"2014-11-13 09:49:10","client_ip":null,"review_ente":null,"title":"Body Image in Children","cid":"GCDX852WNNVBSFV6","review_audi":null,"replaced_nid":null},{"user_login_nid":"4520269","MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Content::Item","js_type":"Magnify.Content.Item"},"review_reco":null,"nid":"414007447","permalink":"4RealBodies","views":"43","magnify_hosted":null,"review_count":null,"posted":"2014-11-13 09:41:07","large_thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/YVVYJ51MV9GKLP1X-l.jpg","view_count":"-1","user":{"handle":"Substantia Jones","cid":"YK6ZD308GS3RQ88G"},"content_status_cid":"filtered","review_info":null,"media_item_nid":"244797891","review_leng":null,"review_score":null,"thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/YVVYJ51MV9GKLP1X.jpg","description":"This video is not what you think it's about. #fauxtoshop\r\n\r\nFalse body images are dangerous.

Dot gives the following update to Substantia Jones of The Adipositivity Project:\r\n\r\n\"Body positivity, body acceptance and body honesty is such an ongoing process, and three years down the line from making the video, it's still an every day effort to feel as positive and confident as I did when I first made it.  Especially now, taking the bus every day in seats that I'm maybe just a bit too big for, thinking about the space I take up and making the conscious decision to affirm to myself that yes, I do deserve to take up that space, and I will not try to make myself smaller for anyone.  The ongoing battle to make yourself (and sometimes others, I guess) believe that you are worth it is pretty tiring, but also one that you can't just give up if you want to survive.  Body honesty is also something I feel pretty strongly about -- because it's okay to feel sad and down about the way the world treats you.  You can't just push those feelings down, you have to acknowledge, process, and work through those negative feelings.  Pretending they don't exist doesn't help in the long run.  It'll wear down on your mental health and like I said, it's about surviving.  Honesty and acceptance are big parts of surviving in this world.\r\n\r\n\"Work like yours is exactly what helps me get through those hard times.\" \r\n\r\nImages from The Adipositivity Project by Substantia Jones: http://adipositivity.com/ \r\n\r\n","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"243506295","posted":"2011-10-20 07:32:26","pipeline_xid":"oTzfBws7JWg","synced":"2015-06-11 09:03:07","poster":"dotdootdot","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTzfBws7JWg/sddefault.jpg","description":"For Joan Braderman's class Women Filmmakers, F11 at Hampshire College.

As creator of The Adipositivity Project, I regularly hear from women who're thrilled to finally see their bodies represented in photographs, some saying they've watched the project for years, waiting to see another woman who's fat in the same way they themselves are. I fully understand the power of this, but it never occurred to me that the same  might be true of one's measurements.\r\n\r\nThis is the first I've heard of the wonderfully grown-up Mallorie Carrington and her SmartGlamour line, but I'm impressed. There are a couple of tiny bits of language in the video which at first seemed to me to be problematic, but I think she explained the first one well, and when she says \"all sizes,\" I'm going to trust that she indeed means all sizes. From their copy: \"SmartGlamour is a body positive women's clothing line of customizable fashion basics for sizes XXS-6X and beyond.\"\r\n\r\nWhat's more, there's going to be a pop-up shop (including all the abovementioned sizes) opening this Friday, March 6, and running through May in Manhattan's East Village.

We're only saying these things because we think your music is so good. If only you'd wear a small heel, doesn't have to be a spiked heel, but a small heel and if you wore a sleeve you would have made it bigger in the music business already! Take Ella Fitzgerald as an example. She was a big lady too and she wore beautiful garments!\"\r\n\r\nElly Kellner got this feedback after a concert in September 2014 from a man and a woman. First she listened to what they wanted to tell her and then she stood their sobbing. Elly is just a girl with a heart and a soul. An extremely musical, curvy woman, overweight yes, with chronic pains yes. She exercises, laughs, creates, eats healthy, eats unhealthy, she is all the colours of the rainbow and she wears the clothes that she wants. The astonishment after hearing the big focus on appearances and the advice to cover up her upper arms, resulted in a new song 'Deugdelijk' or 'Decent'. Together with the Ellybellyrep Dancers a video was recorded and it has become a plea for 'live and let live' and Positive Body Image. 'Deugdelijk' is approached with humor the message is clear: \"This is my body, I am thankful that I have one and I am the one that decides what clothes I put on it. Everybody gets to be themselves!\"\r\n\r\nWould you like to help by sharing this message?\r\nSharing = Caring\r\n\r\nPS: The outfit that started all this off can be seen in the cow scene.

This is the body of someone who has struggled with an eating disorder. This body is misunderstood. When people see it they assume I sit on the couch and eat McDonald's all day, when in reality Ive never even seen a Big Mac in person. They tell me its wrong. Its not okay to be fat, theyll say. You need to be healthy. Lose some weight. But then when they see me at the gym, they whisper and giggle just loudly enough for me to hear. Im a joke, something to be put in a hole until Im pretty by the standards of society.\r\n\r\nBut before you tell me whats wrong with this body, let me tell you whats right. This body can run for miles and not give out on me. This body is strong. This body has curves. It has muscle and it has cellulite. This body is fueled with healthy foods, but doesn't fail if I feed it improperly from time to time. This is the body of a size 14, the average size of the American woman. And it should be represented the way it is: beautiful. This is the only body I will have for the rest of my life. It shows my struggles and it shows my progress. Why shouldn't I be proud of it? Why shouldn't it be celebrated? Why shouldnt the path to health be every bit as beautiful as the finished result? I am thankful for what this body has done for me. I am thankful for the healthy path I have taken, both mentally and physically. I am proud of what I've overcome.\r\nThis is my body.\r\n\r\nThis took a different direction than I assumed it would when I planned it out in my head a few months ago. I didn't want this to be just another fashion video; I wanted it to be a lot more. The monologue is based on something I wrote in an Instagram post earlier this month, and I'll type the full thing out down below. Post it on Tumblr, write it down and put it on your wall or just keep it in your head; but remember these words. Remember that there is nothing wrong with you or your body. I love all of you more than you know.\r\n\r\nWhat am I wearing?\r\nOutfit 1: Top from Target\r\nBottoms from Leigh-Ann's\r\nOutfit 2: Top from Target\r\nBottoms from Leigh-Ann's\r\nAmerican Flag scarf from Charlotte Russe\r\nOutfit 3: Top and bottoms from Forever 21\r\nFloral Headband from Icing\r\nOutfit 4: One-piece from Leigh-Ann's\r\nOutfit 5: Top and bottoms from Leigh-Ann's\r\nKimono from Living Doll LA\r\nOutfit 6: Top from Target\r\nBottoms from Forever 21\r\nBow from Forever 21\r\nOutfit 7: One-piece from Target\r\nBow from Forever 21\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Not a sponsored video.

Most recently The Glamazons were featured and on the cover of Full Blossom Magazine, Funk The Formula Magazine, Volup2 Magazine, and Bleep Magazine.

NSFW. Also not safe for Londoners.\r\n\r\nFrom the artist:\r\nFlabzilla subverts the concept of the monstrous fatty and plays with common perceptions of an othered physique. A morbidly obese behemoth rises from the sea and uses her body mass to attack the city of London, which is built entirely from cardboard and packaging tape. Treading a fine line between grotesque and sex, weighty flesh and physical power clash with intricately crafted landmarks until all is destroyed.  In 2013 I was a finalist at Hamburger Queen  Scottees pageant for fat people that aims to promote body-positivity. I encountered a lot of new concepts to me including fat activism, body-confidence campaigning and fatshion blogging. I found myself inspired in many ways but quite critical of some approaches and the experience led me to experiment with communicating and encouraging body-confidence in my own work. I wanted to focus on what fat bodies can do and be, rather than how fat bodies can look or how they serve others.  Im a London-based artist working in performance and video. I use the absurd to explore themes of transformation, ritual and existential liberation. My art is autobiographically-rooted with parallels to my own experience of the transgression of social boundaries and cultural alienation. I like laughing, crying and getting naked.

Bad music, wardrobe malfunctions, a cartoonish comeuppance for the antagonists sizeism, and a curious comparison between nasal dislodgings and ones beloved. But any opportunity to see fat women owning it on the dance floor, and Im in. Features Whitney Way Thore, fresh from her \"A Fat Girl Dancing\" video and body image campaigns. Go 'head on, Whitney.\r\n\r\nFrom Fitty:\r\n\r\nInternational fitness expert and Rapstar, Fitty Smallz follows up his smash hit Hamburger Fries \u0026 Shake with a hard hitting message that breaks down the barriers of body image and celebrates the acceptance of all body types, with Muffin Top. From one extreme to another, Hamburger Fries \u0026 Shake featured UFC and MMA champion Chuck The IceMan Liddell, while Muffin Top features media superstar Whitney Way Thore whose viral video A Fat Girl Dancing and her No Body Shame Campaign has taken the Internet by storm. What better way to celebrate female empowerment and a platform that embraces all body types than a music video titled Muffin Top?\r\n\r\nMuffin Top is another collaboration with Team Fitty including; Fitty Smallz, Ryan Viti and Christopher Royden Myers of Mighty Music Group under the Fitty Smallz record label, Notorious F.I.T. Productions. The video was Co-Produced and Directed by Fitty Smallz and Kurt Hudson and edited by Kurt Hudson. Director of Photography, Kyle Carbajal, Grip/Gaffer, George Deacon, Grip, Yonas Tesfai and Production Assistant, Terrel Jordan. Additional music engineering by Eli Moorhouse. Mixed and mastered by Paul Lapinski from My Platinum Sound.\r\n\r\nMuffin Top was filmed over a two day period starting in the legendary Cinottis Bakery, a sweet tooth tradition in Jacksonville, Florida since 1964 (http://www.cinottisbakery.com). Day two featured the Metro Entertainment Complex, which is a landmark establishment in Jacksonville, Florida, providing eye popping, jaw dropping, over the top entertainment to the city for over two decades (http://www.metrojax.com).\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to our amazing cast and crew, including plus sized actresses, Kandi Miller and Treasure Clay, our Mean Girls, Brooke Bedsaul, Moni Marie and Elaina Ivy, and our \"permanent pregnant glow\" actress, Dana Merrill. Thanks also to D.J. Mako Millions, superstar Rap/R\u0026B sensation Chris Knite, photographer Richie Varela, behind the scenes videographer, Lee David, Hair and Make Up Autum Quinn and Natasha Wiggins, fashion stylist, Lisa Pepin-Donat and Manikin Models for casting (http://www.manikinmodels.com).\r\n\r\nExtra special thanks to Whitneys agent, Michael DeFosse of Marilyns Agency, and of course, to the extraordinary talented Whitney Way Thore who flew into Jacksonville by herself and performed tierlessly for two full of days of performance during the Muffin Top production. On the third day she appeared with Fitty Smallz on live TV for First Coast Living where she danced to the performance of Hamburger Fries \u0026 Shake. On the forth day, she put together a dance team and performed a live set on the main stage at Jacksonville Landing with Fitty Smallz and his crew for the feature performance during the Beautiful Bodies Competition. Whitney Way Thore rocks!\r\n\r\n\"The first rule of happiness is to be comfortable in your own skin. The second rule is to spend as little time as possible focusing on what other people think about you. -Fitty Smallz ","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"243794001","posted":"2014-10-15 21:02:58","pipeline_xid":"YTptCTjAgus","synced":"2014-10-24 07:18:02","poster":"Fitty Smallz","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YTptCTjAgus/sddefault.jpg","description":"http://youtu.be/YTptCTjAgus International fitness expert and Rapstar, Fitty Smallz follows up his smash hit Hamburger Fries \u0026 Shake (http://youtu.be/_9LAyCJgD-Y) with a hard hitting message...","license":null,"media_equivalence_nid":null,"tags":"Entertainment","duration_seconds":"271","format_info":null,"media_pipeline_cid":"youtube","source_href":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTptCTjAgus","title":"Fitty Smallz- Muffin Top","cid":"1HJFLM0BHPGZLCDF"},"approved":"2014-10-15 18:24:46","client_ip":null,"review_ente":null,"title":"Fitty Smallz - Muffin Top","cid":"6SS76438381W071J","review_audi":null,"replaced_nid":null},{"user_login_nid":"4520269","MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Content::Item","js_type":"Magnify.Content.Item"},"review_reco":null,"nid":"413708357","permalink":"Fat-lady-Belly-Dance-amazing","views":"864","magnify_hosted":null,"review_count":null,"posted":"2014-10-10 12:18:39","large_thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/57TMJH1LKSH3B0NJ-l.jpg","view_count":"-1","user":{"handle":"Substantia Jones","cid":"YK6ZD308GS3RQ88G"},"content_status_cid":"filtered","review_info":null,"media_item_nid":"243600551","review_leng":null,"review_score":null,"thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/57TMJH1LKSH3B0NJ.jpg","description":"Drum solo belly dance performed by the amazing Mandanah at a Middle Eastern Treasures concert, October 19, 2008, Humanist Hall in Oakland, presented by Mary Ellen Donald.","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"243600551","posted":"2013-12-04 21:24:11","pipeline_xid":"qkBG42i4BV8","synced":"2014-10-10 12:18:21","poster":"Shahrukh Salman","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qkBG42i4BV8/sddefault.jpg","description":"now that a bally dance by fat lady watch and enjoy the dance.","license":null,"media_equivalence_nid":null,"tags":"Music","duration_seconds":"350","format_info":null,"media_pipeline_cid":"youtube","source_href":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkBG42i4BV8","title":"Fat lady Belly Dance amazing","cid":"57TMJH1LKSH3B0NJ"},"approved":"2014-10-10 12:18:39","client_ip":null,"review_ente":null,"title":"The Hypnotizing Mandanah Performs Drum Solo Belly Dance","cid":"3G66H835V1F980GH","review_audi":null,"replaced_nid":null},{"user_login_nid":"4520269","MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Content::Item","js_type":"Magnify.Content.Item"},"review_reco":null,"nid":"413686263","permalink":"Turning-the-Lens-on-Fat-Shaming","views":"53","magnify_hosted":null,"review_count":null,"posted":"2014-10-08 07:27:59","large_thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/X3JRF61XWHQQDJBP-l.jpg","view_count":"-1","user":{"handle":"Substantia Jones","cid":"YK6ZD308GS3RQ88G"},"content_status_cid":"filtered","review_info":null,"media_item_nid":"243488685","review_leng":null,"review_score":null,"thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/X3JRF61XWHQQDJBP.jpg","description":"Rubab Abid wrote: Substantia Jones and Haley Morris-Cafiero are two female photographers who are using their cameras as a way to fight back against fat-shaming.

It seeks to both address existing issues of sexism within the mainstream porn industry as well as create new spaces and paradigms for pornography that challenge mainstream tropes. It also strives to create fair and favorable working conditions for performers. Through these many changes, feminists relationship with porn has shifted from battles over what pornography reveals about structures of power to experiments in what pornography can change in structures of power.\r\n\r\nPornography has become the way that people learn about sex. It has become the new sex education, as actual sex-ed is scarce and highly limited. By depicting authentic, non-scripted, diverse representations of men, women, and genderqueer people, feminist pornography has the potential to sexually educate and sexually reorient the public and thus revolutionize sexual relationships.\r\n\r\nOlivia Tarplin is a Jersey City native who received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Global Studies with a concentration in Gender and Media Studies from The New School in 2014. Her research has centered around issues of gender, politics, sexuality, media, and specifically pornography. Focusing on the thriving industry of feminist pornography, she has spent the past 2 years studying how experiments in feminist porn can change the widespread sexual culture and how porn made ethically can act as a new and improved way to educate the masses about sex. In keeping with these interests, during her time in college she co-designed new and innovative ways to teach sex-positive sex/health education, and implemented these strategies by leading sex education workshops in Freshmen classrooms around campus. She currently works in New York City in the non-profit world.","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"250070825","posted":"2015-03-30 16:59:37","pipeline_xid":"x38-iHvUqLY","synced":"2015-05-13 13:08:07","poster":"TEDxTalks","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x38-iHvUqLY/hqdefault.jpg","description":"Feminist pornography has evolved from its beginnings of female porn icons and sex-positive academic feminists.

This performers immersion in the New York Burlesque scene and her resulting paradigm shift inspired her to delve into ways women can experience their own bodies in new and affirming ways. In this talk, Lillian discusses self-esteem, risk-taking, and diversity, and offers practical techniques for destroying self-negativity\r\n\r\nLillian Bustle is an actor, singer, burlesque performer, and gleeful loudmouth about body love. Although her first burlesque performance was in 2012, she made her nightclub debut at the age of 14 as a singer in a drag show. Shes been covered in glitter and boas ever since.

This is a tall order. I'll get to the end of a great piece, only to find there's a wildly false statement or an otherwise problematic message. Those videos don't make my cut. Except for this one.\r\n\r\nIt's made for educators, and it's brilliant and necessary. At 5:26 there's what appears to be an great body positivity book list for kids. (I've added 'em to my holiday gift list.) HOWEVER. The audio features a song that's currently heralded as being a body positive song, but is actually disturbingly body-shaming in both it's skinny-bitch-isms and its prescription of what's required to have the \"right\" body. I realize my opinions on this song run counter to those of most of my contemporaries, even amongst many of my fellow body politics activists. That doesn't make the song any less body-shaming.\r\n\r\nSo. Here's what I suggest to you. When the song begins, mute it, then unmute it when you see the kids being interviewed. You're safe from that point on. I didn't wanna throw this baby out with the bathwater. It's too good not to share, just because of the misguided inclusion of a song that's perhaps not entirely understood.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n~Substantia Jones, Your Body Image Video Curator\r\n","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"244797895","posted":"2014-11-09 18:40:03","pipeline_xid":"111367926","synced":"2014-11-10 07:48:02","poster":"Katelynn Roman","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/495958197_1280.jpg","description":"","license":null,"media_equivalence_nid":null,"tags":"","duration_seconds":"351","format_info":null,"media_pipeline_cid":"vimeo","source_href":"http://vimeo.com/111367926","title":"Body Image in Children","cid":"RR53R11F53YSVRZZ"},"approved":"2014-11-13 09:49:10","client_ip":null,"review_ente":null,"title":"Body Image in Children","cid":"GCDX852WNNVBSFV6","review_audi":null,"replaced_nid":null},{"user_login_nid":"4520269","MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Content::Item","js_type":"Magnify.Content.Item"},"review_reco":null,"nid":"414007447","permalink":"4RealBodies","views":"43","magnify_hosted":null,"review_count":null,"posted":"2014-11-13 09:41:07","large_thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/YVVYJ51MV9GKLP1X-l.jpg","view_count":"-1","user":{"handle":"Substantia Jones","cid":"YK6ZD308GS3RQ88G"},"content_status_cid":"filtered","review_info":null,"media_item_nid":"244797891","review_leng":null,"review_score":null,"thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/YVVYJ51MV9GKLP1X.jpg","description":"This video is not what you think it's about. #fauxtoshop\r\n\r\nFalse body images are dangerous.

Dot gives the following update to Substantia Jones of The Adipositivity Project:\r\n\r\n\"Body positivity, body acceptance and body honesty is such an ongoing process, and three years down the line from making the video, it's still an every day effort to feel as positive and confident as I did when I first made it.  Especially now, taking the bus every day in seats that I'm maybe just a bit too big for, thinking about the space I take up and making the conscious decision to affirm to myself that yes, I do deserve to take up that space, and I will not try to make myself smaller for anyone.  The ongoing battle to make yourself (and sometimes others, I guess) believe that you are worth it is pretty tiring, but also one that you can't just give up if you want to survive.  Body honesty is also something I feel pretty strongly about -- because it's okay to feel sad and down about the way the world treats you.  You can't just push those feelings down, you have to acknowledge, process, and work through those negative feelings.  Pretending they don't exist doesn't help in the long run.  It'll wear down on your mental health and like I said, it's about surviving.  Honesty and acceptance are big parts of surviving in this world.\r\n\r\n\"Work like yours is exactly what helps me get through those hard times.\" \r\n\r\nImages from The Adipositivity Project by Substantia Jones: http://adipositivity.com/ \r\n\r\n","community_site_nid":"165775","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"243506295","posted":"2011-10-20 07:32:26","pipeline_xid":"oTzfBws7JWg","synced":"2015-06-11 09:03:07","poster":"dotdootdot","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTzfBws7JWg/sddefault.jpg","description":"For Joan Braderman's class Women Filmmakers, F11 at Hampshire College.
