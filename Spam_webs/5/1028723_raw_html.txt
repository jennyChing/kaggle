     Since its use is so
widespread, especially among American youth, its no wonder there are a lot of
claims circulating about the drug, many of them negative. For instance, one
website dedicated to keeping teens from using marijuana claims that the drug
can make you mess up in school, in sports or clubs, or with your friends. If
youre high on marijuana, you are more likely to make mistakes that could
embarrass or even hurt you. If you use marijuana a lot, you could start to lose
interest in how you look and how youre getting along at school or work (

presented in this way can be misleading, as it provides no scientific evidence
for these lofty claims. As a result of websites such as this, many individuals
have distorted information regarding marijuana and both its short-term and
long-term effects on the human body.

     One of the most
common claims about marijuana is that it can kill brain cells, damage brain
function, and causes learning and memory impairment. This may seem like a bold
claim, but in a society dedicated to keeping teens off drugs, it often seems
appropriate to use intimidating statistics in order to yield results. For many
years, these ideas have been simply accepted as correct, but recently scientists
have developed interest in the severity of such a lasting claim, and many
studies have been done which attempt to answer this very question: does
marijuana really damage brain function and impair memory?

     The
active ingredient in marijuana is delta-9-tetrohydrocannabinol, commonly
referred to as THC. THC binds to and activates specific receptors in the brain,
known as cannabinoid receptors (
     <a href="http://www.ctprevention.org/saac/Saac_Files/fs_marijuana_brain.pdf">
      http://www.ctprevention.org/saac/Saac_Files/fs_marijuana_brain.pdf
     </a>
     ).
When these receptors are activated, THC interferes with the normal functioning
of various areas of the brain, including the cerebellum, part of the brain
responsible for balance, posture, and coordination of movement, and the
hippocampus, which is involved with memory formation. As a result, individuals
under the influence of marijuana may experience impairment in motor control and
compromised short-term memory. In the intoxicated state, memory is often
selectively impaired in a dose-dependent fashion similar to alcohol (Deahl 1991).
Marijuana also affects receptors in the cerebral cortex that are responsible
for sensory perception, which can cause users to experience altered sensory experiences
in areas such as touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. It can cause
distorted perception, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem
solving, and problems with learning and short-term memory (

intoxication on an individual are commonly accepted and are generally
undisputed. However, the long-term effects have received a great deal of
debate, as scientific research has yielded contradictory results.

    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     In
response to many negative claims against marijuana use, Morgan and Zimmer (1991)
compiled existing literature and data into a single document in order to
discredit what they felt were widespread myths about the drug.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     One
of these myths was that marijuana damages brain cells, and that this damage
causes memory loss, cognitive impairment, and learning difficulties. They
report that this claim is based on a study by Heath et. al (1980), in which
structural changes in several regions of the brain were found in two rhesus
monkeys exposed to THC, the active chemical in marijuana. These changes
occurred primarily in the hippocampus, the area of the brain known to play an
important role in learning and memory, which suggested that exposure to THC in
humans would yield similar negative results.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     However, according to Morgan and
Zimmer, in order to achieve these damaging results, doses of up to 200 times
the psychoactive dose in humans would have to be given. Even studies in which
subjects were given 100 times the human dose failed to cause any structural
impairment of the brain. Additionally, in a more recent study of rhesus monkeys
by Slikker et. al (1992), in which the monkeys were exposed to the equivalent
of 4-5 joints per day through face-mask inhalation for an entire year, seven
months later there was no observed change in hippocampal structure, cell size,
cell number, or synaptic configuration. As a result of these studies, Morgan
and Zimmer concluded that the claim that marijuana causes physiological damage
to brain cells is incorrect.

    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     A study by Block et. al (1999)
yielded similar results, finding that frequent marijuana use does not produce
clinically apparent MRI abnormalities or detectable global or regional changes
in brain tissue volumes of gray or white matter, or both combined. However,
the study notes that anatomical abnormalities could occur at a microscopic
level that cannot be measured by an MRI, so the true results of the study
remain somewhat unclear.

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     Despite this, Morgan and Zimmer
acknowledge that there is evidence that marijuana, especially in high doses,
can interfere with users ability to transfer new information into long-term
memory. Thus, although while under the influence of marijuana, learning is less
efficient, there is no evidence that marijuana users suffer permanent
structural impairment.

     In addition to the hypothesis that
heavy marijuana use can cause impairment to memory and brain function, it has
also been suggested that extremely heavy marijuana use can lead to a mental
condition that is often referred to as cannabis psychosis. (Iverson 2003) This
condition generally results from taking very large doses of the drug, and can
often be serious enough to lead to the subject being admitted to the hospital,
as the symptoms are often confused with those of schizophrenia. These symptoms
include delusions of control, grandiose identity, persecution, thought
insertion, auditory hallucinations, changed perception, and blunting of
emotions. However, this condition is a result of the acute toxicity of
marijuana, and is generally unrelated to long-term use of the drug.

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     Despite this, additional studies
have also found a correlation between heavy marijuana use and a display of
schizophrenic symptoms. As reported by Hall and Solowji (1998), one study in
Sweden of 50,000 individuals found a dose-response relation between the
frequency of marijuana use by age 18 and the risk of a diagnosis of
schizophrenia over the subsequent 15 years. In the study, it was determined
that the relative risk of schizophrenia in those who had used cannabis before
was 2.4 times greater than in non-users, and for individuals who had used marijuana
more than 50 times in their lifetime the risk was 6 times greater than
non-users. The results of this study suggest that cannabis use can exacerbate the
symptoms of schizophrenia, and can bring out the symptoms in individuals who
are predisposed to a future diagnosis of schizophrenia.

    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     Additional studies have
yielded similar results. Hambrecht and Hafner (2000) studied 232 patients in
Germany with first-episode schizophrenia and found that 13% had a history of
cannabis use, a rate twice that of matched normal controls. While these results
seem convincing, however, they dont necessarily prove a cause-and-effect
relationship between marijuana and schizophrenia. Rather, it could be that both
marijuana use and schizophrenia are related to a common predisposing factor.
For instance, many marijuana users come from deprived social backgrounds, which
is a known risk factor for schizophrenia-like psychosis (Iverson 2003). Other
reports from New Zealand, Australia, and France have also concluded that the
development of cannabis dependence in young adults is associated with increased
rates of psychiatric symptoms (Patton et al., 2002). While schizophrenic patients
often use marijuana and other psychoactive drugs as a form of
self-medication, they can often make the symptoms of delusions and
hallucinations worse, and can also counteract the anti-psychotic effects of
drugs used to treat schizophrenia (Negrete et al., 1986; Linzen et al., 1994).
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     However,
though there exists a clear correlation between heavy marijuana users and
psychiatric illness, it is still unclear whether or not this is a causative
relationship. If marijuana use were truly a causative factor for schizophrenia,
the United States likely would have seen a large increase in cases of
schizophrenia in the last 30 years as a result of increased use in the 1960s
and 1970s. However, a review of epidemiological evidence up to 1990 failed to
show these results, suggesting the relationship between marijuana use and
psychiatric illness is not completely direct (Thornicroft 1990).

     A
study by Block and Ghoneim (1992) compared the performance of 144 adult
marijuana users and 72 non-marijuana users in order to study the impairments of
human cognition and learning that resulted from frequent marijuana use. These
individuals were recruited through advertisements, and classified their own average
weekly marijuana use as not at all, less than once, light (1-4 times),
intermediate (5-6 times), or heavy (7 or more times), as well as the
duration of their use at this frequency. They also filled out a questionnaire
that documented the number of occasions in which they had used various other
drugs in their lifetime, during the last 12 months, and the previous month.
Additionally, and perhaps most importantly (as this is a crucial part that is
often left out of similar experiments), the individuals were matched on
intellectual functioning before the onset of drug use based on their scores
received during the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills standardized test. Finally, in
order to ensure that the test results would not be influenced by the effects of
other drugs, subjects had to abstain from alcohol from 6 PM the night before
each session up through the entire day of the session. Additionally, subjects
had

     There were two sessions of
the experimental testing. The first, lasting about 3 hours, consisted of four
tests from the Iowa Tests of Educational Development, as well as the Short Test
of Educational Ability. All of these tests were multiple choice
pencil-and-paper tests. The second session, which lasted 2.5 hours, involved
cognitive and psychomotor tests, which were taken on a computer.

expression (recognizing misspelled words and correcting grammar errors),

literary materials (answering questions about a given text), and a short test

list of 16 nouns, half of which were high imagery words, which are easily
visualized, and half were low imagery words, which are more difficult to
visualize, was presented on the screen at a rate of 3 seconds/word. The subject
tried to recall as many words as possible on seven consecutive learning and
test trials. The subject tried to recall the whole list on each test trial, but
after the first learning trial, the subject was reminded only of the words
missed on the immediately preceding test trial. This procedure made it possible
to test several aspects of memory, as well as total recall.

other portrayed a fuzzy concept, which the subjects had to recognize in order
to correctly match the families.

     The
next test measure text learning, in which the subject read a paragraph from a
magazine article and then recalled as much as possible during three minutes.
Then, the subject reread the paragraph and recalled it again. The subject then
repeated this entire procedure with a different paragraph. The subjects recall
was tape-recorded in order to be scored for text learning.

    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     The
fourth test measured free and constrained associations, in which a subject was
presented with 100 words and was asked to give a single word as an association.
For the first 50 words, the subject could give a free association, but for 10
words each, the subject had to provide one of five different types of
constrained associations, in which the response had to be related to the
stimulus in a specified way.

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     The
fifth test measured paired associate learning, in which the subject was shown a
list of 30 pairs of words. The initial word from each pair was then presented
to the subject, who had to try and respond to the second word from each pair.
This was repeated once with the same set of words, and then the entire
procedure was repeated with a different list.

     Finally,
the sixth test was a series of psychomotor tests. In the first, the subject
viewed two light-emitting diodes: one which was flickering and the other which
was not. The subject had to indicate which of the diodes was flickering, and
the computer determined the flicker fusion threshold. The second half of the
test measured discriminate reaction time, in which the subject viewed a series
of digits that flashed for 100 milliseconds each and pressed a button following
each 4 that appeared. The computer altered the interstimulus interval
depending on the subjects accuracy. This procedure was repeated four times.

     The results of the first
session were conclusive: heavy marijuana users showed impairments in mathematic
ability and verbal expression on the twelfth grade Iowa Tests compared to
non-users. However, heavy users were unimpaired on the other three tests:
vocabulary, ability to interpret literary materials, and short tests of
educational ability.

   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     On
the second session, the results were somewhat mixed. In Buschkes Test, heavy
marijuana users showed impairment relative to non-users in long-term retrieval
for high imagery words, although not for low-imagery words. However,
interestingly enough, intermediate marijuana users achieved a higher percentage
of correct answers than non-users for fuzzy concepts on the concept formation
test. On the other computerized tests, including text learning, paired
associate learning, free and constrained associations, and critical flicker
fusion and discriminate reaction time, there was no evidence of the effects of
marijuana use.

   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     Overall,
the experimental results suggest that heavy marijuana users do show overall
impairments relative to non-users in the areas of mathematics and verbal
expression, but not in any other abilities. These impairments may indicate that
the regular use of marijuana 7 or more times in a week can damage the central
nervous system beyond the acute effects of the drug. However, there are a few
confounding variables that may affect the validity of the above claim.

     Block
and Ghoneim acknowledge that the association between impairments in brain
function and marijuana use may be more indirect than the results suggest. For
instance, if marijuana users go to school high, they might learn less or
remember less of what they learn as a result of acute marijuana intoxication
and not the long-term brain effects of extended use. Thus, the lower test
scores of heavy marijuana users may be attributed to the short-term effects of
marijuana use and not the potential impairment caused by excessive long-term
use. As a result, although this experiment was one of the better-designed
studies of the effects of marijuana use on the brain because it matched
subjects on intelligence before the onset of marijuana use, it is still someone
inconclusive. Though the results suggest that heavy marijuana use may affect
the mathematical and verbal expression abilities of an individual, the link was
not direct enough to completely attribute these impairments to the effects of
extensive marijuana smoking over time and not acute marijuana intoxication.

     Despite significant amounts of
research in existence regarding the potential damaging effects marijuana can
have on brain cells, memory, and brain function, experimental results present
conflicting information regarding the validity of the claim.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     The
results of the studies discussed above demonstrate that many heavy users of
marijuana experience some form of memory or brain impairment, whether it be
difficulty transferring new information into the long-term memory, lower
mathematical and verbal abilities, or an increased likelihood of displaying
symptoms of psychiatric illness. However, in each of these studies, there was
not enough evidence to prove that marijuana is a direct cause for these
problems  rather, it could possible that individuals who are predisposed to
heavy marijuana use are also predisposed to these impairments.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     Additionally,
analyses of the physiological structure of the brain of heavy marijuana users
did not display any difference from non-users, although the studies also
suggest that brain abnormalities could exist in an undetectable form.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">

    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     One aspect
the research seems to have concluded is that the risk for brain damage exists
solely for heavy marijuana users, and those who use it less than 7 times a week
generally do not show any more risk for brain damage than do non-users.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
    <span style='font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>
     Thus,
although significant amounts of research have been conducted regarding
marijuanas long-term effect on the brain, it is still impossible to reach a
definite conclusion about the potential damaging effects the drug may have. Although
the current research suggests a link between heavy marijuana use and damage in
brain function, more research needs to be conducted in order to determine
whether or not this link is causative. While the occasional joint is unlikely
to cause much damage to an individuals brain, until more research has been
conducted, heavy users should evaluate their habits, as they may potentially be
causing significant damage to their health.
