         The magician Merlin was an important figure in the Arthurian romances that circulated widely in Europe from late in the twelfth century. Merlin, full of wisdom, prophecies, and magical arts, had a conspicuous lack. He lacked the seductive love magic to promote the charms of a magical sword that, thrust upon women, would bring them wondrous, life-giving blessings. So lacking in seductive love magic was the magician Merlin that he had to beg and barter for sex with women. Merlins abjection in love indicates more generally
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/08/18/chivalry-medieval-european-romances/">
          mens love magic
         </a>
         replaced in medieval culture with
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/02/23/ulrich-von-liechtenstein-frauendienst/">
          mens love servitude
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Merlin was unable to carry on a love affair while maintaining his freedom and his friendships with men. Before Merlin went to stay with his girlfriend Viviane, he said a final farewell to his friend King Arthur. Merlin also said farewell to his friend and scribe Blaise. Merlin explained:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          he was going to stay with his lady, and he would never have the power to leave her or to come and go as he wished. [1]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Viviane sought to control completely Merlins life. One day, she said to Merlin:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I beseech you to teach me how I might keep a man imprisoned within a tower or walls or irons through wizardry, so that he could never get away but through me.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Merlin was reluctant, but incapable of saying no:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I know full well what you are thinking, and I know that you want to keep me. And I am so overcome by love of you that I must do your will
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Viviane put her arms around his neck and spoke to him about their love. Merlin, falsely believing that love means never saying no to a woman, taught her the imprisoning spell. She then used the spell on him. He became imprisoned in their love, while she was free:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Merlin never thereafter left the stronghold where his lady love had put him, but she came and went as she wished.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         If Merlin appreciated seductive love magic, he would have already cast such a spell on Viviane.
        </p>
        <p>
         While
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/28/dread-game-de-amore/">
          wizards of seduction employ dread game
         </a>
         , Merlin lost love by being too eager to please and too needy in love. Merlin fell in love with the beautiful woman Morgan. Merlin told her:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          There is nothing you could ask of me that I wouldnt do if I could. [2]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Men presenting themselves as doormats for women dries up womens love for them. Thats particularly damaging for men who have children, because when a relationship fails, men are much less likely than women to
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2011/04/24/sex-discrimination-in-child-custody-and-child-support/">
          retain custody of their children
         </a>
         . So it was for Merlin. He and Morgan had a son named Yvain. Yvain would grow up to be a famous knight. But Morgan soon threw Merlin out of their home and out of his sons life:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          She drove Merlin away from her, because she saw that he loved her madly, and she told him that she would
          <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/06/16/husbands-disparage-bad-women-shackled/">
           have him tortured and killed
          </a>
          if he came near her again.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Morgan soon began living with another man. They conspired to steal Excalibur, King Arthurs magic sword. Morgans mistaken handling of the sword led to her new boyfriend being gravely injured. His plotting of revenge against her put her in mortal danger. Then Merlin saved her because still he loved Morgan greatly. Thats nice. But thats not an effective way to get Morgan to love him. With Merlins help, Morgan contrived to get her new boyfriend beheaded. That criminal favor didnt gain for Merlin Morgans love.
        </p>
        <p>
         Merlin fared even worse with Ninianne than with Viviane or Morgan. Merlin fell in love with Ninianne. He longed to have sex with her. He went to see her every day for four months. She kept him in a friend zone and never had sex with him. Secretly she hated him. She accepted his visits because she wanted to learn magic from him. When Ninianne set out on a long journey to her home country, Merlin accompanied her. Near the Lake of Diana, Merlin asked Ninianne if she wanted to see it. She said that she did, so Merlin showed it to her. He also showed her a tomb:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          here lies Faunus, Dianas lover, who loved her madly, and she was false to him and killed him by the greatest treachery in the world. Such was his reward for loving her faithfully. [3]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Ninianne asked Merlin how Diana killed Faunus. Merlin explained that, after living with Faunus for two years, Diana fell in love with another man, Felix. To get rid of Faunus, she by trickery induced him to climb naked down into the tomb. Then she sealed him in with a stone. She then got some molten lead, poured it in on him, and killed him. Like the knight in the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/14/widow-of-ephesus/">
          seven sages version of the widow of Ephesus
         </a>
         , Felix was outraged at her behavior. He beheaded her and threw her body into the lake. Ninianne learned much from that story. Merlin, despite his powers of prophecy, perceived nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ninianne hated and exploited Merlin while he loved her. Despite never having slept with Merlin, Ninianne told Merlin that she wanted him to build for her a beautiful, luxurious house by the lake:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          He said that he would undertake it gladly, since she asked for it of him. [4]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         She invited her guy friends to join them at her new house by the lake:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I tell you, she said, that I have gold and silver, which Merlin has given me, as much as you can spend in your whole lives.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Merlin lived with Ninianne in the house by the lake. He lived with her as a friend, but loved her passionately:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Merlin stayed with Ninianne and lived there night and day, and he loved her so passionately that he loved nothing else in the world so much. Because of the great love he had for her, he did not dare ask her to do anything for him, for he dared not anger her. He kept thinking that in some way it would happen that he could have his will with her completely {have sex with her}.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Merlins behavior toward Ninianne caused her to hate him even more:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          there was nobody in the world she hated so mortally as she did Merlin, because she knew well that he desired her maidenhead [5]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Mens sexuality is never more hated than when a
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/07/27/william-nastagio-federigo/">
          man seeks sex servilely and imploringly
         </a>
         as a friend offering many material gifts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ninianne murdered Merlin through adapting stories he told her. One day when they were out in a deep valley, Merlin asked Ninianne if she wanted to see a lovely little room hewn in the rocks. She said that would be a marvel. Merlin, ever the worshipful beta, declared You are right. Then he told her the marvelous story. A prince infuriated his father the king by falling in love with a low-born woman. Because his father threatened to kill her, he secretly had his men chisel a hidden refuge in the rocks. The prince and his beloved took up residence there for the rest of their lives. They died on the same day. Their bodies, embalmed, were placed in a sarcophagus carved in the rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ninianne re-imagined the story of the two lovers along the line of the story of Diana. Ninianne conceived a plot to kill Merlin:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          When the maiden heard this story, she was full of joy, and she thought then that she would put Merlin there, if she could, and if magic and the power of words could help a woman, she thought she could accomplish it. [6]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Ninianne told Merlin to lift by magic the heavy stone covering the two lovers sarcophagus. She then said that she wanted to sleep in the room next to the sarcophagus. Merlin bedded down next to her but in another bed. Once Merlin fell asleep, Ninianne so enchanted him that he wouldnt awaken for a long time. She ordered other men to throw Merlins body into the sarcophagus and replace the stone covering. She then sealed the tomb with a magic spell she had learned from Merlin. Entombed by his beloved, Merlin died a slow, horrific death in the presence of the embalmed bodies of the two dead lovers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Merlin the magician died a horrible death because he lacked the most important magic for men: seductive love magic. The equipment that all men have is
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/02/22/asinarius/">
          largely sufficient
         </a>
         for seductive love magic. Whats most important is true learning. Merlin could have studied

          how Paul seduced Thecla
         </a>
         . He could have learned

          how Joseph converted Aseneth
         </a>
         . Saint Jerome, who had
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/08/18/saint-jerome-women/">
          many devoted women followers
         </a>
         , provided a well-known model for being
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/08/04/theophrastus-golden-book-marriage/">
          confident, authoritative, and highly entertaining
         </a>
         . Merlin could have imitated Saint Jerome, but for carnal purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Seductive love magic ultimately rests on empirical science. What happened to Merlin was highly predictable. If men abase themselves and seek love servitude to women, women will respond to them like the

         In Andreas Capellanuss influential medieval treatise
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , gender inequality takes important forms in addition to the widely celebrated
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/07/alain-chartier-belle-dame-sans-mercy/">
          debasement of men in love servitude
         </a>
         . The sexual economics of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         claims global welfare benefits from toil of men not free to choose in important ways.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         s considerable influence on normative views of love has helped to sustain
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/11/30/gender-equality-gender-bigotry/">
          anti-men gender inequality
         </a>
         across major historical changes in public authority.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         defines loves as a compulsion that men suffer through uncontrollable thinking at the sight of a beautiful woman. Its definitional discourse is scholastic:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          1. What would be love
         </p>
         <p>
          Love is an inborn suffering which results from the sight of, and uncontrolled thinking about, the beauty of the other sex. This feeling makes a man desire before all else the embraces of the other sex, and to achieve the utter fulfillment of the commands of love in the others embrace by their common desire. [1]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         In the medieval scientific consensus, Andreass definition of love is a carefully constructed, properly scientific definition drawing on a long philosophical tradition.[2] In elite thinking today, Andreass definition tends to be disparaged as oppressing women with mens gaze. In any case, the definition explicitly excludes popular understanding of rape. To be love, sexual union must be by common desire. Yet, like under
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2011/03/22/persons-in-jail-for-child-support-debt/">
          current laws regulating mens sexuality
         </a>
         , men lack significant freedom of choice in love. According to
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , men must discipline their eyes
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/02/24/saint-pelagia-men-desire/">
          not even to glance at a beautiful woman
         </a>
         . If a man glances, his freedom to choose vanishes, and he becomes subject to considerable suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         disparages men pursuing economically rational means for having sex with women. A fee-simple transaction with a harlot provides probably the most economical way for a man to secure sex.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         harshly rejects men having sex with harlots, now more properly called sex workers:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If my views are asked on loving harlots, I say that all of them should be utterly avoided because intercourse with them is a most foul pursuit, the sin of lewd behavior being almost invariably committed with them.  I do not wish to instruct you on how to obtain this love, for no matter how affectionately harlots yield themselves to a suitor, they bestow these favors without the pressure of entreaties, so you should not ask for instruction on this. [3]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreas wants men to entreat women for sex. He thus also disparages men loving women who engage in sex readily:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Do not tie yourself with bonds to such a woman, for you could not win her love by any skill of application. A woman of this type cannot unite herself to anyone with bonds of love because of her excessive sexual appetite; she seeks satiety through the lust of many. So in vain do you seek her love, unless you regard yourself as
          <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/03/02/men-sexual-needs/">
           so virile in sexual matters that you can satiate her lust
          </a>
          . But this would be more difficult than draining the seas completely of their waters.  love is definitely absent where favours are granted readily.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Wealthy men can trade on their wealth for sex. While Andreas says nothing about men purchasing for themselves exotic horses and ostentatious castles, he disparages men wearing perfume and making themselves glossy with bodily adornment. He also rejects men wooing women with lavish gifts:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          if any woman is so obsessed by burning avarice as to offer herself to a lover for a gift, she is to be regarded by all as no lover, but as a counterfeiter of love, and consigned to the brothels of unchaste women. Indeed, the degenerate life of such women is more to be despised than the sensuality of those who prostitute themselves for money in public.  it is better for you to bargain with women who hang about brothels on the street, and to purchase their bodies for a small sum than to acquiesce in being robbed of your riches by the woman who like a courtesan apes a lady under pretense of love.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         In Andreass view, wealthy men, like all other men, should toil for sex with women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Andreas emphasizes that men must toil for sex with women. He refers to men gaining and winning womens love.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         includes a lengthy section of eight dialogues instructing men on how to gain love from women. No dialogue describes women gaining love from men. In one dialogue, a common woman declares:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If no great prizes can be won unless some heavy labours done, you must suffer the exhaustion of many toils to be able to obtain the favours you seek, since what you ask for {sex with the woman} is a greater prize. [4]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The common man responds:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I give you all the thanks that I can express for so sagely promising me your love when I have performed great toils. God forbid that I or any other could win the love of so worthy a woman without first attaining it by many labours.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The Arthurian romance embedded within
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         has a girl instructing a knight to undertake a dangerous quest to win the love of a beautiful lady. The knight fights with one man and suffers a bloody side wound. He nonetheless grievously injuries the other man and defeats him. The knight kills a second man, severs the limb of yet another, and with hard blows to the head blinds a third. In response to his violent ordeal and great hardships, she rewarded his labours with her love.[5] In
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , women are essentially entitled to sexual love. Men, in contrast, must toil, fight, and suffer for sex.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to stark gender inequality in sexual labor,
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         presents men pursuing women without reasonable regard for mens plausible self-interests.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         considers mens pursuit of women in terms of a nearly complete enumeration of class pairs among commoners, nobles, and higher nobles. Within that enumeration, a man of the higher nobility pursues a common woman, a noble man pursues a noble woman, and a common man pursues a woman of higher nobility.[6] The nearly complete pairings by class imply two principles of sexual economics:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Men have lower sexual value than women do. Hence men pursue women, and women dont pursue men.
         </li>
         <li>
          Men and womens social class is instrumentally relevant to sexual pursuit, but mens sexual interests dont vary systematically across women. Nothing other than the
          <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/04/27/sexual-selection-theory/">
           essential feature of having a vagina (being a woman) predicts mens sexual interest
          </a>
          . Mens sexuality is thus more animalistic than that of other animals, who typically prefer to mate with females indicating high fertility.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         These principles of sexual economics are peculiar literary constructs, particularly in medieval Europe. Medieval European literature fully recognized
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/06/23/la-saineresse-malice-cuckolded-men/">
          womens strong, independent sexuality
         </a>
         . Men throughout history have typically
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2012/09/16/arabic-love-poetry-roman-love-elegy-aging/">
          preferred to have sex with beautiful, young, warmly receptive women
         </a>
         . A woman of higher nobility could offer a man benefits from a sexual relationship that a common woman couldnt. A common man might trade off to some extent a womans privilege against a lower value in beauty, youth, and warm receptivity. But what about a man of higher nobility pursuing a common woman? Holding constant beauty, youth, and warm receptivity, a woman of lower social class is less sexually attractive to men.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         obliterates mens plausible sexual interests in their pursuit of women.
        </p>
        <p>
         In
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         s sexual economics, the tight constraints on mens sexual agency and the obliteration of mens sexual interests are linked to large benefits in general public welfare. The man of higher nobility sets out the dominant ideology of sexual economics:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I think it is established by the clearest reasoning that men can do nothing, and can get no taste of the fount of goodness, unless they so act under the persuasion of ladies. But though all good things manifestly derive from women, though the Lord has granted them so exalted a preference, and though they are styled the cause and source of all good things, a clear obligation lies on them. To men who perform good deeds they must show themselves in such a light that the worth of such men seems to grow in every way from virtue to virtue under their gaze. [7]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreas in his own voice similarly declares that through women:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          the whole world is ready to perform deeds of kindness, the rich have their wealth of possessions increased, plentiful provision is made for the poverty of the poor, and miserly men are brought back to the path of right behaviour and learn the way of generosity. Indeed, since women are able to reward with praise, they create the incentives for doing all the good things that are done in the world.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         According to
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , all good things in the world manifestly derive from women through men toiling to please women. This sexual-economic ideology now prevails in liberal democracies around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gender inequality should be considered truthfully along with increases in welfare in assessing sustainability. Public authorities from medieval Europe to the present have been remarkably successfully in
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/21/contract-fraud-financial-fatherhood/">
          making men subject to love servitude
         </a>
         . But holding men in love servitude may not be sustainable forever. If men reject the dogma of love servitude to women and think freely and rationally about their self-interests, the cathedral of civilization will be challenged in a way that it hasnt been from the Middle Ages to the present.

         Woman rewarding men with sex is attested far beyond romance. In the mid-fifteenth-century
         <em>
          Distaff Gospels
         </em>
         , a group of older women meet to share wisdom. Their leader, Dame Ysengrine, asked a older man to act as secretary, recording their words. According to the man, Dame Ysengrine said, I would be rewarded by some of the younger ones of my choice; I was pleased by this suggestion and thanked them. From French trans. Jay &amp; Garay (2006) p. 77. After the man had done six days of writing their words, the meeting ended. The women:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          thanked me very much for the trouble I had taken on their behalf, and for my wages, they promised to help me, if I so desired, to speak for me to some young woman.
         </p>
        </blockquote>

          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.21 to 1.6.564, p. 209. Andreas inexplicably omits a noble man pursuing a woman of higher nobility. Each pair in the class-based enumeration is associated with an exemplary dialogue.

         [7]
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.403, p. 159. The subsequent quote is from 1.9.19-20, p. 219. The last sentence in the second quote is:
         <em>
          Immo laudum decoratae virtute cuncta quae in mundo bona fiunt occasionem praestant agendi
         </em>
         . Walsh more literally translates that with flowery, periphrastic language:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Indeed, they are adorned with the meed of praise, and they afford an opportunity of doing all good things that exist in the world.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Above I provide a translation that makes the substantive meaning clearer.

         Andreas Capellanuss Latin treatise
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , probably written in the 1180s, includes eight dialogues between a man and a woman of various class pairings. Whether man or woman, commoner, noble, or higher noble, all speak the same
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/21/de-amore-andreas-capellanus-rhetoric/">
          rhetorical-scholastic discourse
         </a>
         . The
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         , a Spanish text completed in 1438, drew heavily on the third book of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         .[1] But the
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         s treatment of speech differs fundamentally from that of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . The
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         includes scintillating medieval mimesis of womans speech  realistic, in-character utterances of a wildly comic woman.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         s mimesis of womans speech expands upon
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         s rhetorical-scholastic characterization of women. The third book of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         declares:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          All women are also free with their tongues, for not one of them can restrain her tongue from reviling people, or from crying out all day long like a barking dog over the loss of a single egg.  We see, too, numerous women on many occasions who are so keen to talk that when they are alone they break into speech, and speak aloud to themselves. [2]
          <em>
           <br/>
          </em>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         dilates mimetically on the simile-exemplum crying out all day long like a barking dog over the loss of a single egg. It also represents mimetically a woman speaking aloud to herself. The resulting text is completely unlike the rhetorical-scholastic discourse of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         :
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          What became of that egg? Who took it? Who carried it off? Where is that egg? Although its white, its a dark and ill-starred egg today. Bitch, bastard. Tell me, who took that egg? Who ate that egg? I hope she gets bit by a mad dog or gets hit by the bloody squirts or bad flow; amen! Oh, my double-yoked egg; I was keeping you to set. With one or two Id make an omelet so golden that it would make up for all my misfortunes. And I couldnt bear to eat you and now the devil ate you up. Oh, my egg. Oh, egg. Oh, what a rooster and a hen would be hatched from you! Of the rooster Id make a capon whod bring me twenty dollars and the hen fourteen. Or perhaps Id set her and get so many chicks and pullets so that I could increase my flock and get a leg up on things. Now I wont have any luck, Ill be poor like I was. Oh, my egg, with the round yolk, with such a thick shell. Who ate you up? Oh, Marica, you whore,  Fatface  youve made me poor forever. I swear that Ill punch you in the snout, Miss Low-Dirty-Greedy-Slut. Oh, my egg. And what will become of me? Oh, poor sad me. Lord Jesus, honey, why dont I just go on and croak! By the Virgin Mary, wouldnt you just pop with rage to see such a thing? Woe is me, I dont even own an egg in my own house. Damn my luck and my life if Im not on the point of scratching out my own eyes or pulling out all my hair, by God. How unhappy the woman who every morning gets the bran and lights a fire and works her fingers to the bone to light it and when the fires lit puts on the pot and heats the water and makes the chicken-feed to make layers, and as soon as the egg is laid its immediately snatched away. I hope the Lord gives them rabies and a heart attack. I put up with them, woe is me, and I get along as best I can, and the devil swipes them. Oh Lord, take me from this world, so that my body wont have to taste more sorrows and my soul experience so much bitterness. Oh Lord, because you can, ease my heart of all the pain that I have to suffer every day. Id rather die just once than be dying constantly. [3]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The mimesis of womans speech concerning loss of an egg is immediately followed by similar mimesis of womans speech concerning loss of a hen.[4] Psychological realism tends to be associated with the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2007/03/18/novel-content-creation/">
          growth of novel writing
         </a>
         beginning in mid-eighteenth-century Europe. Yet brilliant mimesis of womans speech can be found in the early fourteenth-century
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         .[5]
        </p>
        <p>
         In dilating upon
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , the
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         combined factual mistakes, fiction, and real experience. It attributed
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         to Jean Gearson. He lived from 1363 to 1429.[6]
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         was written more than a century before Jean Gearson was born. The
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         describes the third book of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         as about Gods love and about the condemnation of the lascivious love for women. Thats an ideological, rather than realistic, assessment of
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/21/de-amore-andreas-capellanus-rhetoric/">
          Andreas Capellanuss intention in
          <em>
           De amore
          </em>
         </a>
         . The speeches of women in the
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         almost surely are fabrications. Moreover,
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/28/de-amore-men-protest-women/">
          not all women speak like that
         </a>
         . In the sentence before the mimesis of womans speech about the lost egg, the
         <em>
          Archpriest of Talavera
         </em>
         declares, So by experience youll see . The womans speech about her lost egg imaginatively, realistically evokes ordinary speech. Thats mimesis of womans speech. Thats a fundamentally important idea in fiction.

        <p>
         In medieval European literature, a
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/05/24/dog-man-best-friend/">
          dog was celebrated as mans best friend
         </a>
         . The proverbial cat was commonly associated with the devil.[1] Both dogs and cats were kept within homes as pets. Both had some unfavorable aspects and associations.[2] Overall, dogs had a better medieval reputation as pets than did cats.
        </p>
        <p>
         Disliked aspects of dogs were bad temper, barking, and attacking. The
         <em>
          Distaff Gospels
         </em>
         , a French text probably composed in the mid-fifteenth century, explained:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          When you hear dogs howling, you must put your fingers in your ears and not listen to them, because they bring bad news  If you dont want to be attacked or barked at by dogs, by day or night, you should have a piece of good roasted cheese and give it to them while saying:
          <em>
           In camo et freno, et cetera
          </em>
          <em>
           {In camo et freno maxillas eorum constringe qui non approximant ad te
          </em>
          <em>
           (
          </em>
          with bit and bridle bind fast their jaws who come not near to you
          <em>
           )}
          </em>
          and they will not disturb you. Lovers should be aware of this trick. [3]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Feeding a dog a piece of bread for the offertory at the following Sunday mass was thought to prevent the dog from becoming bad-tempered. The first brood of puppies from a house dog were to be drowned, for they were sure to grow up to be vicious and dangerous.[4] Ancient literature contains a variety of disparaging references to dogs. That in part reflects dogs being non-humans, yet closely associated with humans.[5]
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared to dogs, medieval cats presented more imaginative dangers. A tenth-century Latin allegorical poem referred to the cat, drunken and immersed in wickedness.[6] A twelfth-century Latin literary text describes a man as:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          like THE CAT, which at one moment has the sweetest face and softest, smoothest fur on the outside. But pull its tail, then it will show its claws on all four feet and tear your hands to shreds unless you quickly let it go.[7]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The
         <em>
          Distaff Gospels
         </em>
         declared:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If you dont want to be on your guard against your male cat, you must cut a piece, the size of your palm, out of its tail because, once it is four years old, it thinks night and day about how to strangle its master.[8]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         At the gates of the Greco-Roman underworld was the
         <a href="http://www.theoi.com/Ther/KuonKerberos.html">
          multi-headed dog Cerberus
         </a>
         . Unlike dogs, cats tend to lurk and spring unsuspectingly. That may have encouraged the medieval association of cats, rather than dogs, with the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dogs were working animals and beloved pets in medieval Europe. Dogs were valued for hunting, herding, and guarding. Long before the Middle Ages, stories told of dogs loyalty and devotion to their owners. The eleventh-century
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/tag/ruodlieb/">
          Latin romance parody
          <em>
           Ruodlieb
          </em>
         </a>
         included an account of a noble hunting dog that sensed and attacked a person who stole from his master.[9] Another story originating in ancient India told of a dog that saved a baby from a snake. The dog was wrongly killed through mistaken belief that he had killed the baby. In thirteenth-century Europe, such a dog was venerated as a martyr-saint.[10] Small dogs were the medieval pet par excellence.[11] They were given names, sometimes overfed with fine food, and loved as loyal companions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cats were also valued in medieval European households. Cats killed house mice and provided companionship. Late in the sixteenth century, Cesare Orsini praised his cat in an epitaph:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The cat is described as his light and dearest companion, who is always around day and night. Even when the owner {Orsini} is called to supper, the cat wanted to give a thousand caresses and coaxed tidbits from the dishes. The cat is described as constantly following him whenever he steps into the hall and is ready to lie down in front of the owner whenever it detects that he is melancholy.  The cat follows him into his study, prowling and pawing around his books and letters. It thus becomes the perfect scholars companion, rousing him from unhappy thoughts, and sitting on his desk and leaping over his books to provide amusement.  The cat jumps into his lap with gentle paws, climbs up on his shoulders, licks his face, purrs to the delight of his owners ears and playfully bites his hand.[12]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Orsinis epitaph applies equally well to a scholar and cat in the medieval period. Suggesting a context of animosity toward intrusive and jealous cats, the
         <em>
          Distaff Gospels
         </em>
         advised:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Young men should not hate cats because they are the cause of great happiness and can assist in achieving success in matters of love with young and charming ladies. [13]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Cats were thought to protect their caretakers from bears, cows, and husbands who turn into goblins at night. The
         <em>
          Distaff Gospels
         </em>
         counseled:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If you have a good cat and you dont want to lose it, you must rub its nose and four legs with butter for three days, and it will never leave the house.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         A specific cat that purred, played, and pleased could easily overcome the abstract association of cats with the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the relative merits of dogs and cats today is a matter of bitter controversy, dogs were generally regarded as superior in medieval Europe. The great twelfth-century
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/tag/hildegard/">
          scholar, writer, and public figure Hildegard of Bingen
         </a>
         praised the loyalty and perceptiveness of dogs. She also declared that the Devil hates dogs for their loyalty. Hildegard described cats as disloyal and remaining with persons only for food.[14] The fifteenth-century
         <em>
          Distaff Gospels
         </em>
         offered a more extreme evaluation of dogs versus cats:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          another woman said: Just as has been said before: if you love your dog, you love your own good. If you kill your cat, you kill your trouble. [15]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/04/06/men-inferior-communication/">
          Womens superiority to men
         </a>
         is now well-accepted in authoritative literature. When women today acknowledge the superiority of dogs, men will be better loved.

         [5] Menache (1997) reviews disparaging references to dogs in ancient literature. Id., p. 1. claims, there is clear opposition to dogs on the part of institutionalized religion. Perhaps eventually recognizing that claim to be untenable, Menarche (1997) added the
         <em>
          ad hoc
         </em>
         claim:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          When Western society freed itself of the protective bounds of ecclesiastical repression, the canine species was liberated from its religious image and the negative connotations inferred thereby.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Id. p. 39. The long journey toward humanism and a more harmonious perception of the universe allegedly was sufficient completed in the thirteenth-century so that the Christian church no longer opposed dogs. Id. pp. 38-9. Thats ludicrous.
        </p>
        <p>
         Human religions tend to privilege humans. Dogs, the earliest domesticated animals, serve as a salient figure for non-humans. Calling a person a dog thus serves as disparaging as non-human or sub-human. See, e.g., Revelations 22:15. Institutionalized religions dont, however, particularly oppose dogs relative to other animals such as pigs and asses. The story of the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2009/11/10/fortune-showing-tops-fortune-telling/">
          Seven Sleepers of Ephesus / Companions of the Cave
         </a>
         , celebrated in early Christian and Islamic literature, has a dog as the loyal companion to religious heroes. Abbot Thierry of St. Tronds early twelfth-century Latin poem, Weep, Dogs laments the death of Pitulus, a beloved dog. Ziolkowski (1993) pp. 272-3. The influential, twelfth-century abbess Hildegard of Bingen praised dogs as pets.In medieval Europe, clerics commonly kept dogs as pets. Walker-Meikle (2012) pp. 3, 8.
        </p>
        <p>
         Menache (1998) documents literary evidence of the long, mutually beneficial association of dogs and human beings. That association encompasses societies in which monotheistic religions have predominated.

         Discussing injuries that men suffer from women is commonly overtaken by claims that
         <a href="http://therationalmale.com/2013/10/23/not-all-women-arent-like-that/">
          not all women are like that
         </a>
         . Andreas Capellanus, writer of the medieval Latin treatise
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , responded to not all women are like that claims with great sophistication. He insistently, categorically declared themes of
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/">
          mens sexed protest
         </a>
         while subtly invoking tedium, insincerity, and lack of reciprocity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mens protest of women is commonly dismissed merely as men showing again and again that all men hate all women and always have. In
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , Andreas initially demurred from criticizing women:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          there is nothing in the world more distasteful or tedious than an over-detailed analysis of the nature or condition of women. Let us therefore pass over this topic at this time, so that we may avoid the reputation of somehow indicting nature because of women, and because the facts are known to any man of sense. [1]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         After only a few more pages of text, Andreas then recited at length themes of mens sexed protest in extreme form.[2] According to Andreas, all women are avaricious, envious, slanderers, fickle, disloyal, vainglorious, lustful, liars, drunkards, etc. Andreas repeatedly insisted that his criticisms apply to all women, without exception. For example, Andreas declared:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          no woman is ever joined in such ardent love with a man that she does not devote all her brains to draining away her partners wealth. This rule of thumb is never found misleading; there are no exceptions to it. [3]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         In a constructed dialogue between a man and woman of higher nobility, the woman protests:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If your ire is roused by my words, you ought to level abusive quotations against me alone; it is inappropriate to rage against all women in general because of the annoyance caused by one. [4]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreas warmly engaged as authorities the eminent and powerful near-contemporary women Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, Marie Countess of Champagne, the Countess of Flanders Isobel of Vermandois, Ermengarde Viscountess of Narbonne, Princess Margurite, and other women. Surely Andreass extreme recital of themes of mens sexed protest would have attracted the attention of friends, family and supporters of these eminent women, along with the women themselves if they were still living. Even if men hating women was so common as to be acceptable, Andreas would have had no interest in showing that he too hated women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Medieval readers may have perceived in Andreass extreme criticism of women issues of sincerity and reciprocity. In disparaging women, Andreas declared:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          No man could so rejoice in womens intimacy or affection as to be able to know the secrets of her heart or the degree of sincerity with which she addresses him, for a woman trusts no man as friend, believing that all are utter deceivers. [5]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The phrase all are utter deceivers echoes back to men Andreass categorical claims about women. In one of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         s exemplary dialogues, a woman of higher nobility said to a common man:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The mere fact of your ascribing to me the cunning of deceit and lying shows that you are pitted with the infection of the same vice, and that the thoughts enclosed in your heart are different from those you speak with a deceitful tongue.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         This vicious circle of reciprocal deceit destroys trust and makes communication, friendship, and love impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Classification of persons is one possible response to the deadlock of annihilating, reciprocal deceit. Andreas distinguished honorable, praiseworthy women from other women:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I do not state all this with the intention of detracting from honourable women as a class, but out of eagerness to rebuke the lives of those who do not blush basely to dishonour by their deeds the ranks of the venerable band of women and to debase them under the lying pretext of love. God forfend that we should ever wish or be able to make covert attacks on the deeds of praiseworthy women, or in this treatise detract from them in any sense. [6]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Drouart la Vache, who adapted
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         into French verse in 1290, distinguished between good and bad women. He declared that what he said applied only to bad women. Johann Hartlieb, who translated
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         into German about 1440, similarly distinguished between good and bad women.[7] In promoting his French translation and refutation of the Latin
         <i>
          Lamentationes Matheoluli
         </i>
         about 1385
         <i>
          ,
         </i>
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/07/men-protest-women/">
          Jehan Le Fvre did likewise
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Mens distinctions between good and bad women in mens protest are suspect. Sexed protest shouldnt be necessary among good women and good men. As for bad women and bad men, few are likely to acknowledge themselves as bad. The distinction between good and bad persons in sexed protest tends to generate disjoint understandings of good men protesting bad women versus good women protesting bad men. In practice, distinguishing between good and bad women tends to be associated with men seeking to gain the good will and support of powerful women.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         hints at an alternative to classifying persons as good and bad in responding to mens sexed protest. Andreas began his recital of womens vices with lack of reciprocity in love:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          You could never find the reciprocal love you look for in a woman. No women ever loved her husband, nor can she ever bind herself to a lover with a reciprocal bond of love. [8]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreas ended his recital of themes from the literature of mens sexed protest with a similar lament for love:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          For a woman does not love with feelings from the heart.  no woman could be united in so close a bond of love to a partner that she does not begin to grow cold towards the usual consolations, and soon become a stranger to her partner once she gets no homage of presents to acknowledge. So it seems that no man of sense fittingly binds himself to a womans affection, because she never continues to reciprocate anyones love
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreass outrageous, extreme recital of themes of mens protest of women could easily generate hate for hate. At the same time,
         <em>
          De amores
         </em>
         ideology of
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/21/de-amore-andreas-capellanus-rhetoric/">
          mens servitude to women in love
         </a>
         is far from reciprocal. Jesus in the Gospels urges Christians to love their enemies.[9]
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         matches mens love servitude to women with a challenge to women to love men who treat them as enemies.

         3.65-112, pp. 307-21. Book 3, from which this section comes, has received little serious critical analysis in the voluminous scholarship on
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . For example, in more than 56 pages (pp. 84-5, 393-448) discussing
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , Robertson (1962) devotes just over one page (p. 447) to Book 3.

         </em>
         1.6.500, p. 189. The man implicitly directed Genesis 3.6 at the woman:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          it was the woman rather than the man who is first said to have served her belly against Gods command, and to have transgressed Gods orders through gluttony. And indeed the man himself would never have entered the service of the belly if he had not chanced first to be compelled to do so by the womens excessive persuasion, deceived at her prompting.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         1.6.499, p. 189. The woman responds that women are naturally innocent and naive and the male is crafty and guileful in all things. Therefore the devil approached the woman first. According to the woman, the devils recognition of womans innocent and mans guile explains the fall:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          If the temptation had begun with the man and had been completely unsuccessful there, the womans resolve would have been strengthened by his example.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         1.6.502, p. 191. This explanation partially shifts the blame for the fall to (not innocent) men.

        <p>
         Dread game is a well-recognized technique in the modern empirical science of seduction. In the seduction literature,
         <a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/putting-game-theory-into-practice-judge-dread-edition/">
          faking an extramarital affair
         </a>
         is a standard prescription for a husband seeking to rekindle his wifes sexual desire for him.[1] Dread game can be divided into two types: natural and supernatural. Natural dread game involves dread of losing a lover to another. Supernatural dread game involves dread of other-worldly punishment for not loving a person. Andreas Capellanuss medieval treatise
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         (
         <em>
          On love
         </em>
         ) indicates that in medieval Europe, natural dread game was more important than supernatural dread game.
        </p>
        <p>
         Supernatural dread game is well-represented in the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/12/22/weeping-dog-tale/">
          ancient, widely disseminated weeping-dog tale
         </a>
         . To seduce a married woman reluctant to take on a lover, an old-woman go-between showed her a small dog weeping from being feed meat heavily peppered surreptitiously. The go-between explained that the weeping dog was a beautiful woman who had been transformed into a dog because she refused to accept a lover. The married woman, horrified with facing that fate, agreed to accept as lover the man who had hired the go-between.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
         In
         <em>
          De amore,
         </em>
         a nobleman tried to run supernatural dread game on a noblewoman. After she rejected his proposition for sex, he declared, Then hear the endless punishment awaiting you.[3] He told the story of a squire who saw a procession of riders. Leading the procession was the god of Love. The god of Love rewards and punishes persons depending on whether their achievements in life have been good or evil. A beautiful woman riding an ugly, limping horse explained to the squire that the last group in the procession is women, like her, who refused all lovers. They are the army of the dead:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          those who follow last of all in so mean an assemblage, walking along in miserable garments, deprived of any kind of assistance, and wearied with pains of every sort (you can clearly witness them with your own eyes, and I too have been thrust into their company), are the most pitiable of all women who during life closed the palace of Love on all who wished to enter, and refused to give answer according to their deserts even to those performing good deeds or seeking a motive or support from them for doing good. Instead they repulsed all who asked to serve in the army of Love; they rejected them as though they found them loathsome. They gave no thought to him who is called the god of Love, in whose army those who sought their love were striving to serve.  Besides this punishment, we have been sentenced to many other kinds of torments which none could know unless schooled by experience. It would be impossible for me to tell them, and quite hard for you to hear them. So women still living in the world should beware not to become our partners in these punishments, for after death no repentance will avail them.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         After this lesson in
         <em>
          carpe diem
         </em>
         , the woman guide showed the squire greater and sterner punishment for women who refused all lovers. These women rested in a
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/04/05/erotics-aridity-ordo-virtutum/">
          place of Dryness
         </a>
         :
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          each of the women was prepared there a seat on a bundle of thorns, which was always being rotated  so that the women were more painfully scratched by the points of the thorns, and their bare soles touched the red-hot earth. Such was the pain and suffering there that I can hardly believe it equalled amongst the very demons of Hell.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         This depiction of topical torment in a supernatural realm wasnt enough to prompt the noblewoman to rush to have sex with the tale-teller. She declared that she would test potential lovers for worthiness and accept only a worthy one.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         ascribes more effectiveness to natural compared to supernatural dread game. Natural dread game is based on jealousy. According to
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , sexual jealousy is intrinsic to sexual love; jealousy is of the nature of love itself and without which true love cannot exist.[4] Moreover, jealousy increases love:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Love again experiences increase when genuine jealousy preoccupies one of the lovers, for jealousy is called the nurturer of love. In fact even if the lover is oppressed not by genuine jealousy but by base suspicions, love always increases because of it, and becomes more powerful by its own strength.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Jealousy is discussed throughout
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . Three out of the thirty-one rules of love explicitly reference jealousy.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         describes dread game in the context of testing love:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          if a man wishes really to ascertain the good faith and affections of his lover, he should most circumspectly and skillfully pretend to his partner that he desires the embraces of another, and is beginning to visit her neighborhood more than usual. If he sees that his partner is upset because of this, he can assume that her love is secure, and that she is embedded in it with the utmost constancy. For when one of a pair of lovers suspects that the other is thriving on the embraces of a new love, or is contemplating some such, darts at once begin fiercely to assail her heart and mind, and to wound her inwardly with unbearable jealousy; and her face begins at once to show clearly her inner torment of mind.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The use of dread game for invigorating love isnt explicitly described, but
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         clearly supports it. In
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         , supernatural dread game generates a skeptical, conditional response: If your assertion is true  whether your account is true or false.[5] Natural dread game, in contrast, is closely linked to the jealousy necessary for love.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through false stereotypes of the Dark Ages, the cultural circumstances of medieval Europe have been deeply misunderstood. Shaping human behavior with supernatural understanding is much more difficult than shaping behavior with interpersonal schemes. For economically reinvigorating sexual love, dread game is mens rational choice.

         Notes:
        </p>
        <p>
         [1] Dread game is much less effective for women to apply to men. Men are more likely to respond to dread game with anger and ejection from the relationship. The implications of
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2009/12/13/social-fundamentals/">
          gender asymmetry in parental knowledge
         </a>
         for evolutionary psychology provides a plausible reason for sex asymmetry in effects of dread game. In any case, women who engage in extra-pair sex should be concerned for secrecy. Secrecy is of considerable concern in
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . See, e.g. 1.6.5-6, 1.6.269, 2.1.1, 2.8.46.

         </em>
         . The
         <em>
          Lai du Trot
         </em>
         describes a procession of two groups on horseback. One group consists of one hundred and sixty happy alluring maidens with their elegantly dressed, beloved men. They all ride rapidly, smoothly, and happily on richly equipped horses. The other group consists of a hundred miserable maidens on poorly equipped, emaciated, weary horses moving in a slow, painful trot. A hundred men, as miserable as the maidens, follow unloved behind them. For the French text with English translation, Burgess &amp; Brock (1999).

         Amid scholastics engaging in dialectic and courtiers entertaining with romance in France about the year 1300, Andreas Capellanus created a work of attention-seeking rhetoric. He wrote a formally scholastic Latin treatise
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         (
         <em>
          On love
         </em>
         ).[1] He leavened it with romance, parable,
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/10/06/archpriest-of-talavera-men-guile/">
          fabliau
         </a>
         , and wisdom. Rhetoric in medieval Europe typically meant eloquence and sense of decorum. Andreas Capellanuss
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         is ponderous and morally mixed.[2] Superficially learned and provocative,
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         is a unique work of second-sophistic rhetoric in high-medieval Europe.[3]
        </p>
        <p>
         Consider, for example,
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         s teaching concerning a common man seeking sexual love with a common woman. In this, the first of eight class-distinguished sections on approaching women, Andreas warns against greeting women in a way appropriate for harlots. Thats best interpreted as an in-joke among elite men with some Ovidian learning.[4] Andreas instructs men to allow the woman to speak first. Medieval literature recognized that women tend to be
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2009/01/18/both-sexes-talk-longer-with-women/">
          more socially talkative than men
         </a>
         . Apart from harlots in the street, women are also less likely than men to initiate conversation with unknown, opposite-sex adults. Andreass teaching makes sense as amusing rhetoric, not literal teaching of scientific or practical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Andreas deploys scholastic language as amusing rhetoric. He explains that, upon accosting a woman:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          some men so lose their power of speech under the eyes of ladies that they forget those carefully devised remarks which they have arranged in the proper order of their minds, and they cannot develop the topic in its due order. [5]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreas thus describes trying to chat up a common woman with scholastic terms for an orators tasks. Underscoring learned distance from reality, Andreas further and inconsistently counsels:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          only a bold, sagely instructed man should present himself for conversations with ladies
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreass teaching plays on the surface of scholasticism in the incongruous field of heterosexual seduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Andreas also plays on the surface of courtly eloquence in the speech he prescribes for the common man. Imagine the common medieval man declaiming this speech to the common medieval woman:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          When the divine Being fashioned you, he left himself with no further tasks. I see that your beauty is flawless, your wisdom also. No single quality in you remains imperfect, except that it seems to me that you enriched no man with your love. But I am most surprised that Love allows a woman so beautiful and so adorned with wisdom to soldier so long outside his camp. If only you begin to serve under Loves banner, how happy above all others will he be whom you crown with your love! And if by my merits I were to deserve this great honour, no lover alive in the world could rightly be ranked with me. [6]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Men as different as the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2012/05/06/pliny-and-galen-respond-to-love-elegy/">
          Roman lawyer Pliny the Younger
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2011/02/13/an-old-fashioned-love-story/">
          nineteenth-century American philosopher William James
         </a>
         addressed beloved women with solipsistic, self-degrading monologues. Andreas, in contrast, constructed a speech completely inconceivable and inappropriate for a commoner addressing a commoner. Andreas wasnt writing in Latin for commoners. He wasnt writing a systematic treatise of true knowledge or artful practice on how to chat up women. He was seeking the attention of clerical and courtly elites in their own languages.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
         The distinction between pure and compounded love in
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         is matter of rhetoric rather than philosophy or ideology.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         presents that distinction in the style of scholastic thought:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          There exists such a thing as pure love, and that which is called compounded love. Pure love is that which joins the hearts of two lovers with universal feelings of affection. It embraces the contemplation of the mind and the feeling of the heart. It goes as far as kissing on the mouth, embracing with the arms, and chaste contact with the unclothed lover, but the final consolation is avoided . By compounded love is meant that which affords its outlet to every pleasure of the flesh, ending in the final act of love. [8]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         A man utters this love distinction in his wooing of a woman. Pretending that this distinction encompasses all possibilities for love, the man says to the woman:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I approve of both pure and compounded love, but the performance of acts of pure love pleases me more. So you should utterly shrug off empty fear, and choose one or other of the two loves.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The unstated love object for both types of love is the man. Moreover, engaging in chaste contact with the unclothed lover could easily lead to the compounding of sexual intercourse. Recognizing this obvious physiological reality, the woman states:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          You utter words strange and unknown, words which one can scarcely account credible. I am startled that in any person such abstinence of the flesh has been observed, that a man was ever able to curb the onset of pleasure, and repress the motions of his body.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The woman works through the mans rhetorical tactic in scholastic discourse. Modern readers have tended to interpret
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         s distinction between pure love and compounded love as having great theoretical and practical significance.[9] Thats a misunderstanding. Like chaste contact with the unclothed lover, the whole of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         is rhetoric intended to attract attention.
        </p>
        <p>
         Seeking attention differs from being funny or ironic. In addition to the apparent contrast between its first two books and its third,
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         has a great many smaller, more local discrepancies and inconsistencies.[10] Many are neither funny nor plausibly ironic. Some seem too obvious to be unintentional mistakes.[11] Andreas seems to create for readers opportunities to gain self-esteem through perceiving wrongs in his text. Such perceptions would prompt social communication about the work. Thats a shrewd strategy for attracting attention.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         takes for granted mens subordination to women while angling for attention. Among Andreass chief precepts of love is this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Be obedient to mistresses commands in all things, and always be eager to join the service of Love. [12]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         That teaching is appropriate only for masochists and slave-men. While
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/08/18/chivalry-medieval-european-romances/">
          medieval misunderstanding of chivalry
         </a>
         normalized mens love servitude, some men rejected servitude and gender abasement. Andreas also gave voice to their view:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The lover {the man who loves a woman} is in the bonds of arduous serfdom  The lover fears to do or to say anything which could result in his co-lover {
          <em>
           coamantis
          </em>
          } being roused to anger for some reason, or being enraged on some pretext. Who, then, reveals himself such a fool and madman as to try to obtain what forces him with oppressive serfdom to subject himself to anothers dominion, and to be wholly tied to anothers will in all things? [13]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Andreas playfully obscures that love serfdom is, in current academic cant, highly gendered. Among the co-lovers, the man is the serf and the woman is the lord. In medieval times, just as today, some persons accepted love servitude, and some didnt. The individual books of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         are unified in Andreass intention to attract the attention of love slaves and love masters, clerics and courtiers, elite men and elite women.
        </p>
        <p>
         In constructing a case concerning mens love servitude, Andreas created a
         <em>
          controversia
         </em>
         that Seneca the Elder would have appreciated. Heres the hypothetical case:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          A certain man was head over heels in love with a lady, and began to concern himself with her obsessively. When the woman saw him so anxious for her love, she utterly refused it to him. But seeing him none the less preoccupied with longing for her love, one day she made this proposal to him: I am truly aware that you have toiled for my love for quite a long time. But you will never be able to obtain it unless you are first willing to bind yourself with a firm promise to obey all my commands for ever, and to consent to be utterly deprived of my love if you contravene them in any way. [14]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The man, acting as the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/02/23/ulrich-von-liechtenstein-frauendienst/">
          woman-serving lover of European romance
         </a>
         , agreed to do whatever the woman commanded:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          My lady, God forfend that I should ever stray so far as to be found opposing your commands in any way. So I gladly comply with your request as a task most congenial to me.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The woman cleverly responded with a blow-off command:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Then the woman at once commanded him not to toil further for her love, nor to presume to sing her praises in the company of others.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The abject soldier of love soldiered on:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Though this was a most heavy blow, the lover patiently endured it.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         He was rewarded for this blow with an opportunity to act as a white knight and champion of his lady:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          One day, when this lover was sitting with other knights in the sight of some ladies, he heard his comrades speak very disparagingly of his lady, unjustly slandering her reputation in their gossip, quite unfairly and improperly. At first the lover reluctantly forbore as he observed them lingering further in depreciating the reputation of that lady, but then he attacked them harshly with words of rebuke. He began to to refute their insults as a man should and to defend the reputation of his lady.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The woman repulsed the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/07/alain-chartier-belle-dame-sans-mercy/">
          white-knighting omega-man
         </a>
         :
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          When this reached the ears of the lady concerned, she said that he should be wholly deprived of her love because by harping on her praises he had contravened her commands.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Thats the case set-up in
         <em>
          De Amore
         </em>
         . Its the first of twenty-one vignettes setting up various judgments on love. These arent substantial matters for courts of love, real or imaginary.[15] They are cases like the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2009/08/23/effects-of-competition-for-attention/">
          cases of Seneca the Elders
          <em>
           Controversiae
          </em>
         </a>
         . They indicate sophistic attention-seeking.
        </p>
        <p>
         The case question is about the woman. The question or quarrel is
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/07/men-protest-women/">
          always about women in gynocentric society
         </a>
         . Did the woman act rightly? Because women are the
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/08/04/fisherman-of-pont-sur-seine-lecheor/">
          most important judges in society
         </a>
         , thats for a woman to decide.[16] The Countess of Champagne decided:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          She said that such a lady was too harsh in her command . This lover committed no sin by trying to refute by proper correction those who blasphemed against his lady.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Even when

         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         can with good reason be regarded as having been written in the 1180s in Marie de Champagnes court in Troyes, France. Walsh (1982) pp. 2-3. Dronke argues that composition in the 1230s is far more probable than the 1180s. He also argues that
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         was composed in the royal court in Paris. Dronke (1994) pp. 55-6.

         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.385 refers to its author as the lover Andreas, chaplain {
         <em>
          capellanus
         </em>
         } to the royal court. A character named Andreas of Paris apparently was the hero of a lost vernacular romance know about the time
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         was written. Moreover,
         <em>
          capellanus
         </em>
         may mean votary rather than chaplain. The name Andreas Capallenus may thus be a clever reference to the lost vernacular romance of Andreas of Paris and the Queen of France. Dronke (1994) p. 55. I refer to the author as Andreas Capellanus only conventionally.

        <p>
         <em>

         has influentially been described as one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization. Parry (1941) p. 2, quoting in translation Robert Bossuat. Thats closer to true for
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         for the second sophistic (intellectual culture of the early Roman Empire) than for high medieval Europe. The idea that
         <a href="http://the-orb.net/textbooks/anthology/beidler/courtly.html">
          Andreas Capellanus codified the principles of courtly love
         </a>
         continues to be taught today.

         is famous for its rule that marriage is no excuse for not having an extramarital love affair. It also claims that sexual love cannot occur in marriage. Of equal significance is a noblewomans astonishingly indecorous statement to a love-seeking commoner:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Knights should be naturally endowed with slim, long calves and neat feet whose length exceeds their width as if moulded by a craftsman. I observe that your calves are on the contrary podgy, bulging, round and stunted, and your feet are as broad as long, and also gigantic.

         </em>
         ), id. has and gigantic to boot. That jarring pun captures a stylistic aspect of the text, but it isnt in the Latin.

         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . In the influential definition of Boethius, dialectic seeks concessions from an adversary to establish shared understanding of truth. Rhetoric seeks to persuade a judge. In medieval European culture, rhetoric was subordinate to dialectic. Rhetorical concern focused on speaking eloquently. Id. pp. 44, 47-9, 66, 70.

        <p>
         In broader historical perspective, rhetoric can be a means for seeking attention from an impersonal public that judges by its allocation of attention. Heres an insightful discussion of the
         <a href="http://acrosswalls.org/competition-acclaim-attention/">
          difference between competition for acclaim and competition for attention
         </a>
         . Andreas seems to me to have been engaged in rhetoric directed towards competition for attention.

         Judging by surviving documents,
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         was successful in attracting attention over the long term. The first surviving reference to it is by Albertanus da Brescia in 1238.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         was translated into French as the
         <em>
          Livre dEnanchet
         </em>
         in 1252 or earlier. It had attracted enough attention to be condemned by Etienne Tempier, Bishop of Paris, in 1277. Drouart la Vache translated
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         again into French in 1290. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Andreas Capellanus through
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         became a well-known authority on courtly love.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         has attracted a large amount of modern scholarly attention.

         1.6.26-7, pp. 47, 49. The commoner is subsequently described as a tradesmen.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.11 shows contempt for farmers / peasants. It analogizes farmers to horses and mules. It tells men seeking sex with peasant women to use rough embraces and some compulsion. That doesnt mean that men commonly raped peasant women, or that men werent punished for raping peasant women. Medieval scholars have understood
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2013/11/24/pamphilus-abasement-labor-violence/">
          rape in medieval literature
         </a>
         no better than they have understood

          rape in the U.S. today
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Andreas seems to ridicule his own love teaching in describing love of peasants:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          it is not appropriate to instruct them in loves teaching, in case we find that mens estates which are normally harvested by their toil tuns out unfruitful for us through negligence of the cultivator.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.11.2, p. 223. In other words, if Andreas instructed peasants, they would become so engaged in having sex that they would neglect their field work. Thats ludicrous. The second level of humor is that field work, cultivating, and plowing is a
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2014/05/25/genius-plowing/">
          medieval metaphor for having sex
         </a>
         . The text also suggest that the peasants would stop having children if they sought love according to Andreass teaching. If Andreas actually taught peasants
         <a href="http://purplemotes.net/2015/06/07/alain-chartier-belle-dame-sans-mercy/">
          courtly love
         </a>
         , peasant men probably would fail to have sex much more often.
        </p>
        <p>
         [7] Robertson (1962), pp. 403-7, insightfully describes the sophistic quality of the first dialogue. That quality prevails throughout all three books of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . Monson (2005) suggests that Andreas Capellanus was a broadly learned cleric who failed to realize fully and consistently his enormous intellectual ambition in writing
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . From my perspective, Andreas Capellanuss intellectual ambition was that of a learned sophist seeking attention among diverse elites. He greatly succeeded in that intellectual ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cherniss (1975) states that
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         was written as a comic mock treatise. All three of its books are unified through inflated, overdone, essentially comic treatments of literary materials which Andreas found ready to his hand. Id. pp. 224, 237. Attempts to attract attention often appear comic from an external perspective. At the same time, being outrageous and even clownish, if done in a sophisticated way, can be a successful means for attracting attention. See note [15] below.
        </p>
        <p>
         Drouart la Vache described himself as laughing with enjoyment and approval upon reading
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . Wood (2015) p. 116, including relevant Drouart text, with English translation. Drouart also became interested enough in
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         to translate it into French verse. His claim that he cant help but write verse doesnt provide a credible explanation for him translating specifically
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . Wood (2015) shows that Drouart rendered
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         more univocally didactic in support of clerics chaste love of worldly women. Id. p. 115.
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         effectively attracted Drouarts attention. He, however, translated it with much less concern for attracting attention from diverse elites.
        </p>
        <p>
         [8]
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.470-1, p. 181 (from the eighth dialogue between a man of higher nobility and a woman of higher nobility). The subsequent two quotes are from 1.6.475, 476, p. 181. Walsh translates
         <em>
          amor quidam est purus
         </em>
         as such a thing as chaste love, and mixes use of pure love and chaste love for the same type of love. Ive consistently used the terms pure {
         <em>
          purus
         </em>
         } love and compounded {
         <em>
          mixtus
         </em>
         } love. For compounded love, many scholars use the term mixed love. Compounded love seems to me a clearer and more witty translation.
        </p>
        <p>
         [9] Monson (2005) pp. 62-3, 307-10, observes that the relevant exchange is highly rhetorical, but gives relatively little significance to rhetoric in interpreting
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . Wood describes the man as a seductive sophist and a lecherous sophist. Wood (2015) pp. 136, 137. Wood insightfully observes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          the
          <em>
           nobilior
          </em>
          suitor is presented as an immensely resourceful rhetorician who turns verbal somersaults in an ultimately inconclusive effort to coax his interlocutor into bed.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Wood (2015) p. 135. Drouart la Vache eliminated nearly all of the eighth dialogue in his more narrowly directed, more substantive adaptation of
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         . Id. pp. 136-7. Andreas Capellanus throughout
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         worked much like the suitor in the eight dialogue, but with the objective of bringing his text to the attention of diverse elites.
        </p>
        <p>
         [10] Monson (2005) p. 161. Id. pp. 161-3 discusses some of these inconsistencies. Monson observes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          if he {Andreas} was trying to be funny or ironic, he went about it so clumsily that a great many people, from Bishop Tempier {condemning
          <em>
           De amore
          </em>
          in 1277} in to Donaldson {Professor E. Talbot Donaldson, writing about
          <em>
           De amore
          </em>
          in 1965}, have not got the joke.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Id. p. 164.
        </p>
        <p>
         [11] Some examples: in the eight dialogue, the man inexplicable shifts from being a married man to being a cleric. Compare
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.44 to 1.6.478, 481. In the enumeration of dialogues, Andreas inexplicably excludes a dialogue between a noble man and a woman of higher nobility. Andreass tripartite class structure is later revealed to exclude peasants and nuns. These mistakes seem to me too obvious to be unintentional. Andreass love for a nun (
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.8.4-5) similarly seems like a mistake declared for rhetorical effect.
        </p>
        <p>
         [12]
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.269 (precept 7), p. 117. The woman of higher nobility advises the common man that as a lover:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          He must not be a lover of several ladies simultaneously, but must be the dedicated slave of all women in the service of one.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         <em>
          De amore
         </em>
         1.6.155-6, p. 85. That assertion, which relatively few have questioned, is an astonishing testament to

         , an article in the
         <em>

         declared:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          While there is considerable controversy within the predominantly male professions of legal and literary history as to the reality of womens courts and the jurisdiction of love, there is no doubt that the courts of love captured the medieval literary imagination.  Law has always produced and promoted legal fictions, and I contend that the courts of love, whether real or imagined, produced judgments as jurisprudentially relevant, and useful, as more traditional legal fictions.

         Goodrich (1996) p. 636. Id. then incorporated in his discussion of

         s courts of love Jacques Lacan, Slavoj iek, Freud, Luce Irigaray, Hlne Cixous, Niklas Luhmanns, Jacque Derrida, recent French feminist jurisprudence, Anglo-American feminist legal theory, jurist Francine Demichels advocacy of sexually explicit rights, Jane Larsons proposal for a tort of sexual deceit, the psychoanalytically informed jurisprudence of American theorist Drucilla Cornell, and a variety of other tokens of elite interest. Read with understanding, id. provides considerable insight into what Andreas Capellanus was doing in
