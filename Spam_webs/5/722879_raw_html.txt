  This particular knot has many names and seems to be a sequential
    variation from a number of different families of knots.  I've
    chosen to give it the name of
  <em>
   flower knot
  </em>
  because I've
    always thought of its basic shape and ordinal variations as
    flowers.

    Translation Notes
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Strict translation of the Chinese (, zujingco, )
      for the triangular flower (3 petal
   <strong>
    cloverleaf
   </strong>
   )
      or square flower (4 petal cloverleaf) gives
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalis_corniculata" title="Wikipedia on">
    oxalis corniculata
   </a>
   or woodsorrel, a
      clover-like plant.
  </p>

   The
   <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/ishi_ruri/kaisetu.htm">
    Japanese
   </a>
   (: ()()(kichoo)   ()(
      )(musubi)) machine translates as "screen".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Korean (, saengjjok) translates as "ginger knot",
      which in French is "gingembre".
  </p>
  <p>
   The hexagonal flower knot is more commonly known as the
   <strong>
    round brocade knot
   </strong>
   (, tun jn, ) which
      machine retranslates (iTranslate) as "mission jin".  Individually,
    the characters
   <a href="http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E5%9B%A2/1315448">
    
   </a>
   translate as "ball" and
   <a href="http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E9%94%A6/1307921">
    
   </a>
   "brocade" (noun) or "glorious" (adj).  A final note to the
      Chinese translation fun, is that the simplified version (versus the 
      traditional above) of these same characters are very different
      () unlike the simplifed for the square flower.

      (musubi)) machine translates to English as "brocade".
  </p>
  <p>
   The Korean (, maehwa maedeup) is known as the "plum
      blossom knot" but literally "knot knot".	"Plum blossom" is
      "" (maehwa).  I've seen this more than once, though, perhaps
      it's a typo that's been repeated via cut and paste?  To round
      out the list of languages for which I have official or
      semi-official translations or canonical names, the French name
      for this knot (as translated from Korean) is "prunier".

    General Tips
   </a>
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     keep the loops that form the centre of the knot
	  similarly oriented.
    </strong>
    That is to say, as a general
	rule keep the part of the loop that leads from the already
	completed body of the knot aligned to the top of the knot and
	the part of the loop that is closer to the free working end
	aligned to the bottom of the knot.  You can reverse this
	orientation if you wish, as long as you are consistent with
	all the loops.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     keep the centre loops as short as will still allow
	  you to work
    </strong>
    , the petals will take care of
	themselves.  Keeping the centre short and tidy will be closer
	to the final structure of the knot and easier to control than
	if the centre loops are allowed to get long.
   </li>
   <li>
    you'll find that if you pull hard enough, that you can take 
	up slack from one petal to another.
    <strong>
     This is not
	  recommended
    </strong>
    because the larger the knot, the more
	this type of activity will deform the central structure of the 
	knot.  Also, you may find that you are tightening the knot
    <em>
     too much
    </em>
    , so that when it is time to adjust and fine
	tune the final structure of the knot (or take it apart because 
	you made a mistake in design) that it is exceedingly difficult 
	to do so.
   </li>
  </ul>

   <img align="right" alt="large 4 flower" src="flower4-3.jpg"/>
  </a>
  The 4 flower is probably the most common of the flower knots,
    especially since it is easy to combine many of them into a single
    design.  For this reason,
  <a href="howto4.html">
   detailed
      instructions

  </a>
  The procedure to make 3 flower is exactly the same as the
  <a href="howto4.html">
   4 flower
  </a>
  except that you do
  <a href="howto4.html#4s1">
   step 1

  </a>
  The procedure to make 5 flower can be exactly the same as the
  <a href="#howto4">
   4 flower
  </a>
  except that you add an extra loop
    between
  <a href="howto4.html#4s2">
   step 2
  </a>
  and
  <a href="howto4.html#4s3">
   step 3
  </a>
  .  As you can see from
  <a href="flower5.jpg">
   this illustration
  </a>
  , however, the centre is
    already getting quite large and loose, and if the centre doesn't
    hold the whole knot will fall apart.  A modification that will be
    introduced for 6 flower can also be used for 5 flower.  As always,
    the option is yours.

  This variant of the 5 flower is made with the same centre doubling 
    strategy as is used in making the
  <a href="howto6.html">
   6
      flower
  </a>
  except, of course, leaving out
  <a href="howto6.html#6s3">

  As the flower knots get larger, the centers become larger and
    looser, holding together more poorly.  With the 6 flower knot, we
    introduce the

  As you progress

   from the 4 flower through to

  </a>
  , the pattern of how to make a flower as large
    as one has the patience for should become clear.  Make as many
    loops as you want.  Increase the overlapping of the centre loops
    as the centre becomes larger/looser than you want.
