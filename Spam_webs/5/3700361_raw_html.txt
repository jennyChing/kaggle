           My experience involved teaching in American International Schools, located around the world.  I taught in Paris for 4-years, Portugal for 3-years and Peru for 1-year.  These were the best years of my life.  Each vacation was spent traveling throughout Europe and South America.  During the school year, I worked hard and loved the challenges.

           I taught in the Czech Republic for more than a year.  It was wonderful.  Stable jobs were not easy to come by, but the life and people are great.  Smaller towns and cities are definitely nice, but there are plenty of expats filling jobs there nowadays.  Decent work generally goes to the experienced and talented.

           There are many Korean English teaching companies here in the Philippines, since Korea is only 1 hour time difference and online study is popular, although there are also many offline opportunities during the summer and winter vacation periods especially.
          </p>
          <p>
           For native speakers expect a salary of around 25K-40K pesos. If looking to teach privately in condominums or similar probably around 300-500 per hour, depending on teaching experience. Those working with Korean companies should expect Korean company rules such as Korean holidays only (trust me there arent many the biggest is probably Chuseok (harvest festival), which is September, lack of paid vacation and the possibility of long hours.

           Great post, but one correction. Czech Republic is now part of the Schengen zone and does require an EU visa. I had a lot of trouble with this last September, after I was TEFL certified there and wished to stay and teach. Because it is new law, a lot of employers are either unwilling or unable to help with the visa process. Hopefully, with time it will become easier. Im now teaching in South Korea, which is outstanding in terms of pay, benefits and experience. Seoul is a wonderful, vibrant city. I encourage anyone considering teaching abroad to go for it!

           I am not surprised to see that Italy did not make the list!
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, Im bitter because I had one bad experience. I am not ready to let that get in the way of my TEFL future. I just need to take some more precautions next time.
          </p>
          <p>
           That said, this post is informative, it cemented some of what I have heard already and set me up for thinking about my next TEFL experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, Im jealous of those of you who were able to use this experience as you ticket to travel around other regions. Im more broke now then when I got here with no job :(. It is killing me to think I might have to leave Italy without thorough explorations of Italy and the rest of Europe!
          </p>
          <p>
           My best advice; find a company that either sponsors you for a work permit or doesnt care if you have a visa. They are not worth the hassle for a company that is just going to treat you poorly after.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also, ALWAYS stand up for yourself, dont let a company assume that just because you are a traveler they can walk all over you!!
          </p>
          <p>
           Happy teaching :)

          </p>
          <p>
           How is it that you cant ask for ketchup in France ? 95% ( and im beeing nice) of people in France eat ketchup, wether its with fries or something else
          </p>

           Great advice!! I have travelled abroad before when in college some 15 years ago and have been teaching Elementary for 10 years. Now I have a husband, and daughter and was wondering how teaching abroad would be for me now. I am especially interested in any teachers who are African-American as this will surely come into play as an ESL teacher teaching abroad. Any advice or suggestions to steer me in the right direction? Send me an email:

           wow! What fun! I taught in English in Japan and in Taiwan over 20 years ago. I would do it again and may once my children are all grown up. There are so many possibilities out there. Thank you for the inspiration. I must say, when I taught in Taiwan, it was very enjoyable and there were many places looking for teachers. The only drawback was converting your money when you wanted to leave the country. Luckily there are just so many helpful people in that country that it all worked out fine. It is a fantastic place to hitchhike as well and so beautiful outside of Taipei. I highly recommend checking it out!

           Hi Katie!
           <br/>
           Thanks for a great post.
           <br/>
           Your post seems targeted at young people, still unmarried, who want to teach English in order to finance a little adventure before they get serious. I wonder if your ranking would change if the target audience were professional teachers with Masters degrees in TESOL or teaching qualifications in their home countries, or I wonder what your rankings would be if you considered people who had limited qualifications but who wanted to increase their qualifications. Perhaps Japan would rank higher then, because it is still possible to get a job with just a BA, and Temple University and Columbia University offer Masters programmes to working teachers. Japan is definitely a good choice if you want to earn a decent living while getting qualified for a career in TESOL.

           To all of the people who have a problem with this post because the author recommended not asking for ketchup in France. I just want to say that I have LIVED in France and although SOME people eat ketchup and it is available, they have a stereotype of Americans as dumping cups full of ketchup on EVERYTHING. She was making a point to suggest that we avoid the stereotype. Some might eat fries with ketchup, but from what I saw they were much bigger fans of mustard or mayonnaise on their fries (I know mustard eww.)

           Ive taught in Prague for three years and ever since the Czech Republic joined Shengen in January of 2008, you *definitely* have to get an EU visa to teach there. Its not difficult to obtain  a lot of schools will pay for them (in exchange for a guaranteed year contract) or help you get them  but they are a pain to get ahold of. Its a lot of having to go down to Vienna to get things stamped and doctor visits and whatnot. But living in Prague makes it worth it. Its an amazing city.
          </p>
          <p>
           As an aside: dont be fooled by the whole winters are cold thing. Theyre no colder than anywhere else in this climate. It can get down to -10C (about 20F), but not really much worse than that. Winters in my native Toronto are colder.

           This top ten list is way way off in my opinion.  I have been in Asia for 7 years and have been all over and know people teaching esl in pretty much every country in Asia.  I can tell you first hand Taiwan is the best place to teach for pay, quality of life, friendliness of the locals, convenience and proximity to great travel destinations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Korean people and culture are far ruder and racist then any ive met in Asia, with restaurants and taxis that would serve you or pick you up if you are not Korean.
           <br/>
           Never heard of this in TW, in fact foreigners are often given deals and treated as special guests when out and about especially in parts with less foreigners around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Japan is very expensive and few people speak English or care to, there is little English on restaurant menu and around the city (Osaka).  Most things are expensive and there is no special treatment toward foreigners there, but the people are nice, or just ignore you for the most part.
           <br/>
           In Taiwan you can get by in Taipei city with little to no Chinese and people love to practice there English.  The Taiwanese are the friendliest and most helpful people I have ever known.  People really go out of there way to help you in TW.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thailand is great for travel and culture but you wont earn a lot of money there.  You can forget about saving lots of cash.  You get paid enough to live off of and save a tiny bit if you are careful and can resist the urge to travel when there, as there is so much to see.
           <br/>
           In TW I can live an a lavish apartment, have a house keeper, a scooter, travel twice a year to other countries, and eat where I want and do what I want and still save around 1000USD a month.  And all this with working a 30 hour work week.
          </p>
          <p>
           In China it is very similar to Taiwan but the people are not as friendly, less English is used, the cities are more polluted and dirty, but the pay is pretty much the same.  You also have to deal with communist restriction on internet use, and various other things that the democratic country of Taiwan does not enforce.
          </p>
          <p>
           Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are all also very poor, leaving you with not much cash but an adventure im sure.
          </p>
          <p>
           Taiwan is number one all around without a doubt!
          </p>
          <p>
           Thats my opinion and advice, take it or leave it.

           Ive already graduated college in 07, and Ive been trying to figure out what it is that I really want to do career wise. I love travel, learning and language/cultures so I thought teaching English abroad would be a great way to experience all of this.
          </p>
          <p>
           I too have done lots of reading and asking people about where the best places to teach are. Its quite confusing though hearing some people giving rave reviews to some place (ex. S. Korea) while others totally lambast it. Ive considered Taiwan and I would love to get more detailed info about not only teaching there, but real every day life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Id also like more info on places like Vietnam and Saudi Arabia (which is not a place that Ive thought about for many reasons, but Ive heard that it can be extremely lucrative). Id really appreciate any/all inside info.

           Excellent idea especially helpful for those looking for new ideas and places to teach English. I guess it depends on what you are looking for in your teaching experience, new cultures, travel, money. There could be a top 10 for several categories.

           I am about to graduate and i love to travel. I have thought about teaching English, but i have a problem. My spelling sucks. It is really really bad. I can edit my papers really well, but if some one asks me to spell something, i am a bit in trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
           This might be a stupid question but how much does this matter when teaching abroad? Also, how would this affect taking a TEFL course?

           Peculiar list.  Perhaps these are just the most common countries?
          </p>
          <p>
           Vietnam should be top on any list of best countries for teaching English.  Huge demand, high salaries, and super low cost of living compared to any of the countries above.  You can easily find a job, drink boatloads of cheap beer, and stock away plenty of savings every month.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Vietnam, you can live in the major cities, not the sticks.  Yet not deal with high crime, kidnappings, terrorism, etc. like in many of the listed countries.

           This is a well written and researched article and I really like it. The reasons one might have in teaching english abroad might differ but it is a very rewarding and fulfilling. Its something new and different but it is also worth it.

           Hi, :D
           <br/>
           Im considering teaching English abroad, Im not sure where yet.  I am barely receiving my Associates in Arts, was considering Japan, but apparently cant without a B.A.:(
           <br/>
           I would though,  REALLY appreciate  anyones input on where you have received your certification.  Im a little weary of the fast track programs Ive been running to online,( you know the ones that promise you your cert. in 6 days for an arm and a leg lol).  So please if you can email me at

           Im surprised you didnt mention Italy. Ive been teaching English in Italy for nearly seven years, and while I must say salaries arent generous, the culture and history one absorbs via full immersion here more than make up for it.

           France does not require a TEFL for teaching assistants. The process is handled officially through French embassies.
           <br/>
           Umm.. Its spelled Burgundy. And theres also the Bordeaux region for wine, as it the Rhone Valley and the Languedoc.

           My guess as for why Taiwan wasnt listed is the commonly held belief that Taiwan=China.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its just as well; perhaps its exlusion from the list will limit the job competition for those of us whove discovered the benefits of earning a good living while learning Chinese and living among the friendly Taiwanese people.

           I am planning on teaching English abroad within the next year.  Ideally I would like to go to Italy to get TEFL certified and ultimately teach there as well.  I have heard that it is hard to get hired in Italy as unemployment is high and the first to be hired are Italians and EU citizens.  Therefore, I have also been thinking about South America.  Either place would be great.  Im trying to figure out where the best place is to teach, where I would get the most opportunity and have an amazing time as well. Any thoughts, experiences, or ideas?  Oh, and I have  a B.A. in Sociology and am certified in Elementary Education with 2 years teaching experience (substitute teacher). Email me if you have any suggestions or comments! Thanks! :)

           I just finished reading all the comments and am still trying to decide on the best country to start my teaching career in.Initially i was attracted to Thailand but have now been swayed with the idea of maybe teaching in Taiwan.
           <br/>
           Im a 40 something single fella,no kids,no wife,no bills whos just fed up with everyday boring life in the rat race here and decided that teaching english would be a great way to expand my so far limited horizons.
           <br/>
           Any pointers on the best places to teach in Taiwan are,the average cost of living prices and the type of teaching schedule you are expected to fulfill would be greatly appreciated.
           <br/>
           Anybody have any bad experiences or things to watch out for being a noobie going to another country?
           <br/>
           Im looking forward to starting the second half of my life and would appreciate any help i can get to make it a much easier transition from boredom to wonderment!
           <br/>
           Thank you all and look forward to hearing from you.

           Hello,
          </p>
          <p>
           I have been thinking about possibly teaching overseas..I recently graduated with my B.ED.  I enjoyed the list as well as many of the comments, but my biggest question is..where is the best and safest place to teach with a child? I have a 5 year old daughter..who will be in grade one next fall.so if I become serious about this decisionI need to make sure it is safe. You know, without all the kidnappings.. terrorismetc.and where she can enjoy her education as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           If anyone has any ideasplease email me at

           I may be of the minority but having teaching experience in both South Korea and Taiwan, I highly prefer South Korea but YMMV. Those that say its cheaper to live in Taiwan are not taking all costs into account when comparing both countries. Day to day eating costs for example are cheaper in Taiwan but thats about as far as it goes. A beer, nearly same price in both (5,000w vs 150nt) Taiwan you are paying airfare to and from, paying your own rent, taxed at 20% (going to 6% after first 6 months) vs 3.5% in Korea. Buying a scooter in Taiwan (you wont want to be in taiwan without unless in Taipei). Severance pay and pension tack on another 4,000USD to Korea.  Food imo was better in Korea. The natives are more friendly towards expats in Taiwan, I will give them that. Not that Koreans are unfriendly, just more indifferent.  Any questions?

           Great comments everyone! Well I have been teaching English in Vietnam and it is just brilliant! Living in Hanoi is alright but Saigon is better for sure. The communist stuff is definitely felt more in the north and the people are not as friendly, but the north is plentiful with jobs. The southerners pride themselves in being nicer than the northerners- lets just put it that way. I was thinking of teaching in Thailand but was just there last week and it was ALL TOURISTS. The tourists outnumbered the locals by about 10 to 1 which was disappointing but I guess its to be expected by such a touristy place. You make good money in Vietnam too, well alright money- Ive never taught before and Im making $1,200 bucks a month and living for cheap. I would definitely check out Vietnam if I were you, good fun. Easy too, I just showed up in Vietnam, put my name on a website and got a job within 24 hours. Good food, great sights &amp; less touristy than Thailand. Just remember to get a 3 month B3 visa (which you can get extended), dont fall for the work permit that costs over a thousand dollars (its not needed). Good luck!

           I was thinking about going overseas to teach. I am researching South Korea, Abu Dhabi,  Brunei, and the United Kingdom. I am just concerned about how I would be treated and about my safety.  I am a single  25 year old African American woman.  I have a MS in Education and about 3 years of teaching experience. What can I expect?  Thank you in advance for your helpful replies.

           Wow, very concise information here. Ive been a teacher in Canada for seven years and its time to take off for a year. I have NO IDEA where I should go. I have heard that it can be hard being female in Korea, in terms equality. I have spent enough time in Paris, so Id like some where a bit different. I have a house in Canada I will have to rent out, so although I would like to come back with money, Im not looking for coin as my primary objective, but rather a life experience. There are a lot of organizations and researching has become very overwhelming. If anyone could point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.

           Im based in Chiang Mai and the level of English in northern Thailand is abysmal. While I love Thailand and the Thai people and culture dearly, I now firmly believe that a lack of English will hold Thailand back in this age of global competitiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, please, any English teachers out there, DO come to Thailand. Chiang Mai is a fabulously interesting city, and a gateway to so much interesting stuff in northern Thailand and IndoChina (which you can check out on my Thailand Jing Jing blog)

           This comment is for DI am also African American, and wonder how much preference is given to applicants who are of European decent (Caucasian).  I am hoping for an opprotunity to teach in a different country, regardless of my ethnic background.  I have a friend who has a co worker who is currently teaching in the middle east, and she loves it.  She was teaching in the Atlanta Public School System, and seems to be enjoying the change.  Im looking into the program she is currently doing, so if you want so info about that, or just someone to go through this process with free to e mail me at

           Also anyone else who has any advice or recommendations for me feel free to respond as well.  I am interested in going somewhere in Europe, Spain would be nice because I would like to learn Spanish also.or I would also like to teach maybe in Africabut there is not a lot of information about teaching there that I have come across.

           I was sorry not to see Italy posted above. There are many positions for teachers who would like to teach English in Italy, especially in its southern regions. They are government /EU funded, temporary contracts, so teachers who love to work and travel are not locked in to a job in one country. Its a good destination for ESL teachers abroad.

           Hello all,
          </p>
          <p>
           I am also looking to teach English abroad with my boyfriend, and am wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction as far as getting into a program together? Also, I was thinking about Taiwan and China as the main two options. We are both in college in the USA and are about to graduate. I also have never taught before, but really want this opportunity. Anyone please email me with any help, it would be greatly appreciated!

           hanoi2010, I am thinking about taking a CELTA course in Vietnam and then looking for work in the country? Could you please let me know the name of the website that you logged your details on?  I have read several forums recently (mostly on Daves ESL Cafe) that indicate tefl jobs in Vietnam are rapidly declining due to rising inflation and saturation of english teachers. Have you experienced this?  Also, I am a 32 year old female and I have read that many language schools prefer to hire young backpackers because their pay expectations are considerably less. Am I too old to tefl in Vietnam? Thanks, Ellen

           I have been working in S. Korea for 2 years and have found it as a wonderful experience. I dont know price wise the difference between here and other Asian countries (Ive heard good and bad things about Taiwan).  Korea is a completely different culture. I dont take their gestures as rude as its part of their culture. Just as certain things that we do, that they dont like are just apart of ours.  Ive managed to save a lot of money here and spend it freely and travel SE Asia at the same time.  Really, the best situation you can ask for.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, I will be heading to Italy in a few months. Definitely hoping to teach there. Any recommendations as to websites, schools, cities, etc I can look into?  I will have a 12 month student visa while there (though theyre only part time night classes so lots of free time to teach during the day).

           Very cool, everybodys responses! I plan on teaching for a long time in a variety of countries. I do have to say though that people glorify Taiwan in this article, and its a little different talking to teachers here on the ground. People do quite OFTEN have problems with their management, and the whole respect factor (people note about Japan and Korea) is practically non-existent. Yes every school is different, but my bosses refuse to even talk to the foreigners, have thrown things at employees, threatened my passport once, my pay twice, and quite frankly have all 15 employees utterly terrified to make a mistake. Ive heard worse stories from other schools believe it or not.
           <br/>
           I dont want to encourage people to goto other places, but people should know Taiwan has its downsides as well. The North has been very cold and rainy since i got here (October), and its not a nice snowy winter, but just drabby and depressing. And while the people are AMAZINGLY friendly and nice they are also VERY shy, especially around foreigners (I noticed more so in the North). Taipei is a bit of a drabby city, and apart from the mountains is not very aestetically appealing actually its one of the uglier cities Ive ever been to to be honest (my opinion). Also in recent months people have said its not nearly as easy to find a job, especially for those with no experience. Ive only taught in Spain and the Dominican Republic before so I cant really compare Taiwan to Japan and Korea (the other two $$makers), but I can say Ive heard great things and bad things about both. I honestly think it depends on the type of person. Didnt wana be negative but somebody had to be.
           <br/>
           To be positive!! Nobody mentioned the BEAUTIFUL beaches, out of this world hiking, and DUH! HOT SPRINGS! The nightlife is pretty fun and a happenin international crowd makes it easy to make friends even if you dont speak Chinese. Not to mention it is pretty easy to save alot of money if your careful.
           <br/>
           Im VERY interested in Brazil for next year, anybody wana trade info?

           Hi all!
           <br/>
           Im a soon-to-be college graduate with a BA in English (and Philosophy minor). I have NO idea what to do with the rest of my life in terms of career, but Ive always been deeply interested in traveling abroad. Initially, I was quite intrigued by the Peace Corps, however safety concerns have put a damper on that notion (Im a young white female). Taking safety and the piggy bank into consideration, can anyone suggest some locations that do NOT require additional certification? Where might one look to find position openings?
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanks!

I have a masters degree in medicine, and during my college years I did exchanges in Australia and England, so I know I can happily live abroad.  I spent a month in China a few years ago just as a tourst and loved it completely, and that is when I forst got the idea that it would be fun to teach in Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
           My question is  are there other institutions, or personal clients  who would benefit from having an English teacher with 18 years oi medical experience?  For example, teaching English to a doctor, nurse, or medical student?  Just curious.
          </p>
          <p>
           I currently earn a salary of just under $100K, which is typical for PAs at my point in their career.  I know I would be taking an enormous pay cut, but I would not be in this for the money anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anyway, if anyone has any thoughts or information, feel free to email me at

           I was looking into teaching English in Japan; does anyone have an opinion on if this is still a good idea due to all the radiation hype?

           Hello everyone!
          </p>
          <p>
           I am a recent graduate with a B.A. in Anthropology, B.A. in History, and B.A. in International Relations.  My post graduation plan is to teach English abroad in Asia.  However, as I have been applying to programs people have been informing me about the racism I will encounter.  My country of birth is India but I came to America at the age of 3; English is my first language.  Would someone please give me advise on what Asian country would be best for teaching English abroad?  What kind of racism can I expect?  China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan are the four main countries I plan on applying to.

           Just a word of advice to the African American posters, ive just spent 9 months in Shanghai and found theta most people are either bemused or dislike black people for some reason. The Chinese ae not shy about voicing there dislike etc as well! I asked a Chinese  guy once why he didnt like black people and he just said he didnt like the skin color! So beware of not overt racism but certainly a lot of ignorance about world cultures which is understandable given Chinas history. My ex gf is black and shes been in SH for 3 yrs and loves it so I guess it cant be so bad. But there is an issue there.
           <br/>
           Good luck!

           I recently graduated with a BA in English with an emphasis in Creative writing(and a Spanish Minor) and am seriously considering teaching English abroad. However, I worry that the only hang-up in finding work abroad will be the same as it is in the states, namely, my drug-related felony(was arrested 4 years ago, formally convicted 3 years ago, and was released from supervision 2 years ago). Does anyone know how/if this will affect my prospects of teaching English in any/all of these countries? Follow-up, does anyone have any advice on countries where this will be less of an issue/ ways to convince employers the crime was in my past? Thank you!

           Taught in Prague for a year  loved it but bear in mind its not a high paying job. And yes, you need a visa but its probably easier to get than anywhere in western Europe.

           If you are looking for money go to South Korea or Taiwan.

           I am moving to Cortona, Italy next year and was hoping to do some teaching in the local schools. I have 30 years experience teaching in New South Wales system in Australia with students from 5 years to 13 years. I was an executive before I left with much responsibility  for school organisation. Does anyone have advise as to how best to go about getting work and obtaining a work visa for an Australian? I am applying to become an Italian resident.

I would love to teach English abroad, but there has not been a lot out there for someone my age w/ kids. What countries or programs are best for people in my situation?

           Wow!  Thank you for this website!  You have no idea how much I have been pondering this lifestyle recentlyit is all consuming!
          </p>
          <p>
           I gotta say you have all helped me so much with all of the comments.  I guess I will explain a little about myself.  I was bit by the travel bug, 3 years ago, when I studied abroad in Australia (why did I leave?).  Well, I have this ache to go abroad again.  I have been out of college for a year, I am now working as a chemist in a lab, however I have no idea how much money to bring before I would do this.  I am currently paying students loans that are alone, 500 a  month (not even my living expenses), so could anyone give me a realistic number?  I am seriously thinking either Turkey, Italy, or Bali?  I have always wanted to live in Rome, so anyone with any advice that may have gone to Italy, would be greatly appreciated.  Please email me at

           Hello Everyone,
           <br/>
           Im a reasonably avid traveller, and Im trying at the moment to decide if I should do a TEFL certification in Prague, and actually attempt to live over there, or if there is just too much red tape. Ive found it difficult to find unbiased information on this subject. Im not quite sure how interested I am in teaching English ( Ive never tried it though ), but Im looking for a way to live and work in EuropeAnd that seems to be the only way, from what Ive been able to figure out. My main goal is to get into travel and documentary photography and possibly some writing. But I know thats a tough job to get. It would also be great if my DJ or bartending skills might come in handy.
          </p>
          <p>
           A couple of questions if anyone has a moment 
          </p>
          <p>
           A: Does anyone know first hand if Americans are having success finding work in Prague or other European cities these days?
          </p>
          <p>
           B: Is it actually necessary to take the well trodden TEFL path, and does that still provide reasonably certain results, or can an American such as myself find other means of work? Im a college grad, and Im currently working as a wedding DJ, club DJ and part time bartender. Im also a pretty good writer and photographer, as these were my majors in college. Im just very concerened about the work visa situation, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanks for any advice! I just want to live in EuropeBut Ill have to find a job to do that!

           The comments here are so lovely and so helpful. I have enjoyed reading them.I would love to work in Taiwan after what I read here.
           <br/>
           I love the beach and swimming so which would be the best areas for that and what are the beaches like please?
          </p>
          <p>
           Also agree with many people here, I also love Italy.Does anyone know what qualifications one needs to teach in Italy and to earn a good salary eg at a university? I would love to teach in some beautiful city there and enjoy the sunny days and the culture.The holidays I have had in Italy have always been so relaxing and lovely and I enjoy the lifestyle too.
          </p>
          <p>
           Any useful and great suggestions would be appreciated.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you to all for the lovely comments here as it was so nice to read these comments which every one took time to write.

           Just to say that I worked in South Korea for 14 months and loved it. It is a safe and interesting country and the people are friendly. The food is delicious and the culture fascinating. The best few months of my life and I managed to save loads of money and still explore the country each weekend. Also had a long weekend in Japan which was amazing. The only downside is the lack of holidays. Also be careful and research acadamies that you apply to as some are better than others.

           I am wanting to start working towards teaching abroad.  Could anyone happen to e-mail me some answers to the following questions?
          </p>
          <p>
           -A good place to go through for teaching abroad?
           <br/>
           -Afforable TEFL online course?
           <br/>
           -I am wanting to teach in Malaysia, and wanted to know the requirments or were to read about them.
           <br/>
           -How much money should I save up before I go to somewere like Malaysia, including round trip airfair, rent, food, activites, and souvineers?
           <br/>
           -I just started college.  I am wanting to get my bachlors but am I able to travel/teach prior to getting it?
           <br/>
           -Would taking off for one year pose a threat to me getting a Radio tech job when I come back if I went through the schooling for it? (Random question, just wanted to know if anyone in the medical field would know about this, since I know you have to re-take courses if you dont work within a timeframe)

           I am teaching in Cambodia now. The pay isnt great compared to other countries, but it is far above what the locals make so you can live quite well. The schools are very unorganized, but it is a developing country so I somewhat expected that. The people are very kind and extremely friendly. The traffic is something that takes getting used to, as is the weather if you are not used to extremely warm climates.

           Im currently teaching in southwest France as part of the program mentioned in the article (an agreement between the US and French governments).  Comments about the quality of life here are spot-on, but I just wanted to note that contrary to whats stated above, TEFL certification is NOT required for admission to the program (I dont have it), althoughduhit would of course be a plus, and other teaching jobs here do sometimes require/expect it.

           Now in Japan waiting for my visa to be processed. Do anyone know how long it will take? I left China because life their was much too difficult, salaries normally are low, but if you are lucky  you can find a decent job. I found myself traveling from one side of China to another on bus, people would smoke and I would tell them to stop, with some insistance they did stop but they never understood that I could not breathe with the smoke. I was offered a job in Japan but was unaware the school had not open, during the phone conversation only told they were starting a school. I have sent my documents to the government and now wait! Any suggestions.?

           Hi,
           <br/>
           I am about to graduate with a bachelors degree in mass communications. I had not considered teaching before, but I have a professor who taught in South Korea and loved it. I am really intrigued by the idea and believe it could be a great experience. I am just really nervous about getting screwed over by schools because I have read so many bad things. I have also read great things, but there are too many contradictions to make it an easy decision. My professor could help me apply to the school he taught at in Seoul, but I am still concerned that might not mean the situation will be good for me or work for me. I would hope so, but I just hate how many bad reviews Ive read about teaching in Seoul, South Korea.
           <br/>
           Also, I am a female in her early 20s. I do not know if my age and gender adds any extra concern. I would really appreciate any advice or suggestions from anyone who has experience teaching.
           <br/>
           I would like to be able to save some money, but mostly I want to go somewhere where I will be treated with respect.

           Im not sure how old this blog is, but anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive been living in Prague for the past 1.5 years, and spent some of that time teaching.  There are a lot of English teachers in Prague.  Every tom, dick and harry from the Anglophone world is here trying to big themselves up as an English teacher.  Most of them are awful.  I wasnt particularly good, but I was alright and made classes interesting for the students.  Theres a lot of competition for any jobs going and private lessons as well, so it may take a while to establish yourself.  The school year is a standard September  June.  With that in mind, all teaching work takes a nosedive in July &amp; August, even private lessons.
          </p>
          <p>
           The pros: a generally-high standard of English amongst the under-30s, including the students youd likely be teaching.  If you get into a Gymnazium then youre laughing.  Any state school will take care of taxes and various insurances for you.  Your fellow (Czech national) English teachers will also be happy to help you out with various bits and bobs.
           <br/>
           The cons: PAPERWORK!!! Its a ridiculously bureaucratic country, dating back to communism.  Youll spend a ludicrous amount of time in offices filling out forms.  Make sure you bring EVERY DOCUMENT that you might possibly need  birth certs, proofs of previous address, copies of criminal records  everything like this will come in handy.  Make sure you have everything in order  this will make things much easier when you get here.
           <br/>
           Most of the over-40s dont speak much, if any, English, so it is strongly recommended to start learning the Czech language from the moment you arrive unless you want to live in an expat bubble.  It is incredibly difficult, though, and youd need to be here at least as long as me to get to even a basic communication level.  Be very, very happy if you dont know what declination is! It is also hard to be taken seriously as a language teacher if youre not prepared to put in some effort to learn the local tongue.  Dont be a monoglot!!!
           <br/>
           You need to know your articles (a/the) inside-out.  Why is it wrong when a Czech says, I have birthday?
          </p>
          <p>
           I would definitely recommend the Czech Republic, as none of the obstacles I mentioned are really that significant.  It would be better to avoid Prague if you really do want to TEACH, youll have more of a challenge (but a cornered-market) in smaller cities and towns.

           How old is this article??  The Czech Republic is in the EU now and their laws DO apply.  A non-EU citizen can get a job if your school is willing to go through weeks/months of approval for hiring a non-Shengen Zone/EU citizenand most cant or wont since they dont need to.
           <br/>
           I worked for years before the EU and could have stayed and been grandfathered in, but didnt.even with 10 years experience around the world and a Masters in ESL, schools prefer people they can get clearance for in the usual month.
           <br/>
           You cannot legally work on a 90-day tourist visa, and now it is 90 days in any part of the EU only out of every 180 days.so no more in and out visits to restart the clock.
           <br/>
           Non-EU can get international schools or Unis, but not so much language schools.

           China will hit all foreign teachers  in fact all foreign workers   with a new 11% tax (and a 37% employer tax) retroactive October 15, 2011.   China just became too expensive for many foreign teachers.

           Just a warning to everyone here.  If you have any ideas about Vietnam, forget it.  I have been all over S.E. Asia and the worst people by far are the Vietnamese.  Stealing, lying and cheating are normal and there is a good chance that you will be a victim of theft at some point.  Corruption is rampant from top to bottom.  Friends, neighbors and relatives steal from each other regularly.  They will smile at you but really hate foreigners.  Try Thailand, Cambodia or Indonesia.  These places are like heaven and Vietnam is like hell.  Night and day.  Malaysia and Singapore are very developed and modern and also hire ESL teachers.

           Very enlightening read, thank you so much.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am currently an ESL teacher in Taizhou China, coming up on two years shortly and am addicted to this life and job. I started it as a break before my masters but I can rapidly see me doing this for a few more years yet!
          </p>
          <p>
           Having lived in China it has been a great blast but I am definitely interested in going to another country perhaps SK being so close? I definitely plan on Thailand as my last stop before i return home. (Australian)
          </p>
          <p>
           I have a question, the article mentioned that Saudi Arabia has very high paying ESL jobs. Has anyone worked there before? Could they give their experiences if they have.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kind regards, Dan.

           It is January 2012 (just to date my comment).  I am 52 years old and currently teaching in Taiwan. I absolutely love it. It is true that the Taiwanese people are the friendliest.  I have never worked in a place where I have been so welcomed and treated with so much respect and friendliness.  I absolutely love it here and the pay is great compared to the low cost of living. I live in a two-bedroom apartment with kitchen and living room for about $200 USD per month. I am able to save and travel. I have also been to Korea and Japan. Both are beautiful and facinating countries in their own right. However, you get more bang for your buck in Taiwan. So if you are young, just getting started  it is a great place to get teaching experience, save money, be able to afford travel and pay down student loans. They also dont stereotype foreigners like Korean and Japanese do. I was considered too old to be a good English teacher in Japan and Korea. Taiwan has no problem with my age. My school loves me and wants me to stay for a long time (which I probably will).  If you have any questions about teaching in Taiwan feel free to email me at

           Hi, Im currently finishing a contract in Northeast China and will have 3 semesters of experience teaching English to university students by July 2012.
          </p>
          <p>
           Im trying to decide where to go from here. Ive been interested in Japan but have been told that at my age, 48, it may be difficult to find work (JET cuts off at 40 yrs). However, here in China Im told I look to still be in my 30s (I know everyone says that).
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive also given some thought to South America since Im fluent in Spanish. However, the low pay and the violence in some of the countries is a deterrent.
          </p>
          <p>
           Is Japan possible for a guy my age? Thailand is also interesting to me but Im told that the pay is very low and its difficult to save money there. Im a long way from retiring so I need to save money (nearly impossible where I am in China). I can make good money if I go back to my old profession at home but to be very honest, I dont want to return to the USA.
          </p>
          <p>
           I saw a couple of posts here where people spoke highly of Taiwan and Vietnam.  I intend to research both of those countries more and have to admit, until reading these posts, I wouldnt have thought to look at either of those countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           If anyone has any advice for me, please feel free to get in touch on here or at

           Hi Sandra Kennedy,
           <br/>
           I was wondering if you can give more information.  I would love for a summer position in Asia somewhere, but have backpacked around Portugal and have always wanted to move there and teach for a bit.
           <br/>
           Thanks!

           Sure, one can make and save pretty good money in So. Korea. But, many foreigners have had really bad experiences there! :( The country doesnt have a good rep. :(

           Regarding a previous posting, S. Korea IS NOT no.1!!!!! That is B.S.!!!!!!! It is no. HORRID! Many Western and Eastern foreigners have had really bad experiences there as a previous poster noted! I also read a very negative comment today on Yahoo.com by a fellow Westerner who had lived there. :( It is a very xenophobic,arrogant and ethnocentric country, and thats JUST A FACT! The Chinese say the same thing.

           This was the most informative forum I came across on the internet, but know Im even more confused! I was originally trying to decide between South Korea and Thailand, but now Im also considering Taiwan, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Brazil, or Mexico. I have been teaching English in Barcelona for a year and although I love it, I cant afford to be here in the summer when they all go on holiday and I need to go somewhere new and be able to save up some money. My ideal place would combine beautiful beaches but still an active city life. Can anyone tell me how the weather is any of those cities? Rain and Sun have a serious impact on my mood. Im a young Asian American female and am also concerned about how I would be treated in the Asian countries? Also when do the teaching terms begin? Any knowledge would be helpful thank you!!! Email:

           This was quite an informative post Im still reading through the comments.
          </p>

           I am currently a teacher in further education, and for several years now I have wanted to locate work abroad.
          </p>
          <p>
           The one thing I would like to know/ask, is to hear from anyone who has taken children abroad, and what the pros and cons were? I would also like to know of the most reputable companies that one should deal with when trying to locate employment abroad. Many thanks

           You dont need a TEFL certificate in most places in Asia. You need a degree and to be a native speaker.

           My son just graduated from college with a business degree and is interested in teaching English in South America.  There are so many firms on-line that its pretty overwelming and its always good to get first-hand guidance from people such as yourself that have been there.  How would you recommend my son proceed.  Hes not looking to make big $, just break even as long as  he can find suitable housing or a family to take him in.  Hes young and wants to experience the beauty of another culture. Thank you in advance for any guidance.

           Hi Everyone,
          </p>
          <p>
           Great comments. First of all I would recommend that anyone wishing to teach English should do either a TESOL or CELTA certificate (month long intensive). Any TEFL certificates are a waste of time because they are not recognised by employers. Its true that in Asia you usually only need a BA but having a TESOL has been invaluable, especially for university positions.
          </p>
          <p>
           I taught in Japan for a year which was an incredible experience. It is culturally very rich. I would like to echo what someone else said that learning English is not taken that seriously. I felt like the Mums at my Kindergarten saw it more as a social status than their kids actually learning the language. With regards to money, I think its a great option. Yes, its expensive but after 6 months you learn ways of living cheaper and are able to save. I was treated with the utmost respect by the Japanese, being white. However, the language school I worked for, despite giving me a good schedule and paying well, was very unprofessional, so sitting through meetings, where lewd and racist jokes were made, was a bind.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have been teaching in Mexico for a year. For anyone thinking about work in Latin America, youre best chance of getting a job is turning up at an language school. Even with no experience they will probably hire you. I wasted two months last year emailing various schools in Mexico and Columbia, getting no response. I love teaching in Mexico. I started off in a Language School which took advantage of me i.e. deducting taxes without giving me the social security. Be aware. Fortunately, I now work for a University which is a lot more professional. The only downside about Mexico is the money. Sadly the peso is not a strong currency and I question whether I can continue working here on that basis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Happy teaching. People ask, how do I go about this? The answer is: apply for a job.
          </p>

           Can you explain to me, how is it possible to teach English, if one is not fluent insay, Portugese, Russian or Japanese?  And how is it done?  I would love to travel and teach before I retire.

           The best place to teach English is actually in England, in the city of Newcastle!
           <br/>
           They children speak a strange unintelligible language called Geordie. but in the main are generally harmless. But your heart will go out them in their rags and stollen trainers. Do not give them money as they will only spend it on Drugs and alcohol. Teaching them to speak english is extremely difficult, but can be satisfying to know you have educated an illiterate Geordie.

           I have gone through the whole article. Its a well-written document. I am a Bangladeshi citizen. I can share the English teaching and learning situation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a vastly populated country of 160 million people with 143 thousand square km of land area. If we look 20 years back the situation was bad. People were not so interested in learning and teaching English. Now the situation is different. The British council is working here in full swing. They are running so many programs in English language teaching. Besides this there are so many Govt and private organizations who are actively involve in this. People are now fully aware of learning English. In most of the big cities people are well conversant in English. So many foreign teachers are teaching English here. But considering economic situation and in comparison to other countries the salary is a bit lower. Hence forth we are very much acquainted in English.

           i taught in guatemala for six months in a medium sized town in the mountains (coban).  i enjoyed the community and was able to immerse in it (played in soccer and basketball leagues, attended weddings, anniversaries, funerals) even as an outsider with merely get by spanish.  although the teaching was not exactly as advertised, i must admit.  it was difficult to get hours and was not able to fully support myself financially.  i dont regret anything about the experience and i met so many fabulous folks, i just feel as though i should share my thoughts about teaching abroad

           Hey everyone. This is an amazing blog! I am looking into going back to teach abroad again and seem to be having most of the same issues as others on here (ie. where to go for money and lifestyle) and being a single  30 year old female, I wonder about meeting people too. I hope its not all young backpacker types again (Thailand back in the day!) How do you guys meet good friends in places like Taiwan and Vietnam? Those are the two places I am most interested in. I dont want to rely solely on other teachers at the school I go to for making friends. Does anyone know whether other cities in Taiwan (outside Taipei) are pretty foreigner friendly and have lots to do after work? Excited but nervous to take the plunge again after all these years of being settled at home. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!

           I taught in Thailand and loved the time I spent in Bangkok. They treated teachers very well even just on the streets and out and about they treat teachers with much respectnothing like how we are treated here in America. I cant wait until the days I can go back to Thailand and once again call it home!

           I have been teaching English in Taiwan for a year and a half now.  I cant say that I love it, but thats not because of the country or the people.  Mostly just because I discovered that my passion is not in teaching.  Its seems glamorous from the outside, but once youre in the 2-10pm grind (those are usually the hours) it gets a little exhausting, especially because I was also a full-time university student.  Teaching English abroad is worth a try, though whether you consider yourself a teacher or not.  You learn a lot about kids, a lot about yourself, and about the country you are in.  Most schools in Taiwan require a bachelors degree because to get a work permit you need one.  An associates degree can also work, but if you have neither, you just have to look a little harder, you can definitely still find something just depends on how legal you like your work to be.  Schools range from no curriculum, aka you do what you want, to full curriculum with text books and tests.  There are pros and cons to both.  Some companies such as ILP will pay for your airfare both ways and give you free housing.  Larger companies like Joy or Hess often provide housing stipends, but I havent heard too many great things about working for such large corporations.  It often looks great on paper but they call you in for a lot of extra hours and dont pay for prep time which they usually expect to be at least 1-2 hours a day.  I have plenty of English teacher friends who absolutely LOVE teaching English, so it really just depends on your opinion of children, teaching, and the system.  Either way its a learning experience.

           I am currently sitting in my office in South Korea now!!! This really deserves to be number one! The people are fantastic and it wasnt too difficult to transition and I am in a very rural spot here and couldnt be happier! I travel every weekend and my school is amazing, I get to attend the field trips with the kids and they treat me just like one of their own, not to mention the kids are fantastic and so eager to learn!

           My son taught English in most of the countries on the list.  Please note how recruiters (and the author) sell the idea as an adventure because thats the best you can hope for.  There is no future for anyone teaching overseas so if you want an adventure.thats the extent of the job.
