       Introduction
      </a>
     </h4>
     <p>
      When we talk about free software, we usually refer to the free
software licenses.  We also need relief from software patents, so our
freedom is not restricted by them.  But there is a third type of
freedom we need, and that's user freedom.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expert users don't take a system as it is.  They like to change the
configuration, and they want to run the software that works best for
them.  That includes window managers as well as your favourite text
editor.  But even on a GNU/Linux system consisting only of free
software, you can not easily use the filesystem format, network
protocol or binary format you want without special privileges.  In
traditional unix systems, user freedom is severly restricted by the
system administrator.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Hurd removes these restrictions from the user.  It provides an
user extensible system framework without giving up POSIX compatibility
and the unix security model.  Throughout this talk, we will see that
this brings further advantages beside freedom.

the GNUMach Microkernel.
     </p>
     <p>
      I will have to explain what GNUMach is, so we start with that.  Then
I will talk about the Hurd's architecture.  After that, I will give a
short overview on the Hurd libraries.  Finally, I will tell you how
the Debian project is related to the Hurd.

     <p>
      When Richard Stallman founded the GNU project in 1983, he wanted to
write an operating system consisting only of free software.  Very
soon, a lot of the essential tools were implemented, and released
under the GPL.  However, one critical piece was missing: The kernel.
     </p>
     <p>
      After considering several alternatives, it was decided not to write a
new kernel from scratch, but to start with the Mach microkernel.  This
was in 1988, and it was not before 1991 that Mach was released under a
license allowing the GNU project to distribute it as a part of the
system.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 1998, I started the Debian GNU/Hurd project, and in 2001 the number
of available GNU/Hurd packages fills three CD images.

     <p>
      Microkernels were very popular in the scientific world around that
time.  They don't implement a full operating system, but only the
infrastructure needed to enable other tasks to implement most
features.  In contrast, monolithical kernels like Linux contain
program code of device drivers, network protocols, process management,
authentication, file systems, POSIX compatible interfaces and much
more.
     </p>
     <p>
      So what are the basic facilities a microkernel provides?  In general,
this is resource management and message passing.  Resource management,
because the kernel task needs to run in a special privileged mode of
the processor, to be able to manipulate the memory management unit and
perform context switches (also to manage interrupts).  Message
passing, because without a basic communication facility the other
tasks could not interact to provide the system services. Some
rudimentary hardware device support is often necessary to bootstrap
the system.  So the basic jobs of a microkernel are enforcing the
paging policy (the actual paging can be done by an external pager
task), scheduling, message passing and probably basic hardware device
support.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mach was the obvious choice back then, as it provides a rich set of
interfaces to get the job done.  Beside a rather brain-dead device
interface, it provides tasks and threads, a messaging system allowing
synchronous and asynchronous operation and a complex interface for
external pagers.  It's certainly not one of the sexiest microkernels
that exist today, but more like a big old mama.  The GNU project
maintains its own version of Mach, called GNUMach, which is based on
Mach 4.0.  In addition to the features contained in Mach 4.0, the GNU
version contains many of the Linux 2.0 block device and network card
drivers.

      A complete treatment of the differences between a microkernel and
monolithical kernel design can not be provided here.  But a couple of
advantages of a microkernel design are fairly obvious.

      Because the system is split up into several components, clean
interfaces have to be developed, and the responsibilities of each part
of the system must be clear.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once a microkernel is written, it can be used as the base for several
different operating systems.  Those can even run in parallel which
makes debugging easier.  When porting, most of the hardware dependant
code is in the kernel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of the code that doesn't need to run in the special kernel mode
of the processor is not part of the kernel, so stability increases
because there is simply less code to break.
     </p>
     <p>
      New features are not added to the kernel, so there is no need to hold
the barrier high for new operating system features.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compare this to a monolithical kernel, where you either suffer from
creeping featuritis or you are intolerant of new features (we see both
in the Linux kernel).
     </p>
     <p>
      Because in a monolithical kernel, all parts of the kernel can access
all data structures in other parts, it is more likely that short cuts
are used to avoid the overhead of a clean interface.  This leads to a
simple speed up of the kernel, but also makes it less comprehensible
and more error prone.  A small change in one part of the kernel can
break remote other parts.

      There exist a couple of operating systems based on Mach, but they all
have the same disadvantages as a monolithical kernel, because those
operating systems are implemented in one single process running on top
of the kernel.  This process provides all the services a monolithical
kernel would provide.  This doesn't make a whole lot of sense (the
only advantage is that you can probably run several of such isolated
single servers on the same machine).  Those systems are also called
single-server systems.  The Hurd is the only usable multi-server
system on top of Mach.  In the Hurd, there are many server programs,
each one responsible for a unique service provided by the operating
system.  These servers run as Mach tasks, and communicate using the
Mach message passing facilities.  One of them does only provide a
small part of the functionality of the system, but together they build
up a complete and functional POSIX compatible operating system.

      Using several servers has many advantages, if done right.  If a file
system server for a mounted partition crashes, it doesn't take down
the whole system.  Instead the partition is "unmounted", and
you can try to start the server again, probably debugging it this time
with gdb.  The system is less prone to errors in individual
components, and over-all stability increases.  The functionality of
the system can be extended by writing and starting new servers
dynamically.  (Developing these new servers is easier for the reasons
just mentioned.)

      But even in a multi-server system the barrier between the system and

      Inter-process communication in Mach is based on the ports concept.  A
port is a message queue, used as a one-way communication channel.  In
addition to a port, you need a port right, which can be a send right,
receive right, or send-once right.  Depending on the port right, you
are allowed to send messages to the server, receive messages from it,
or send just one single message.
     </p>
     <p>
      For every port, there exists exactly one task holding the receive
right, but there can be no or many senders.  The send-once right is
useful for clients expecting a response message.  They can give a
send-once right to the reply port along with the message.  The kernel
guarantees that at some point, a message will be received on the reply
port (this can be a notification that the server destroyed the
send-once right).
     </p>
     <p>
      You don't need to know much about the format a message takes to be
able to use the Mach IPC.  The Mach interface generator mig hides the
details of composing and sending a message, as well as receiving the
reply message.  To the user, it just looks like a function call, but
in truth the message could be sent over a network to a server running
on a different computer.  The set of remote procedure calls a server
provides is the public interface of this server.

     <p>
      So how does one get a port to a server?  You need something like a
phone book for server ports, or otherwise you can only talk to
yourself.  In the original Mach system, a special nameserver is
dedicated to that job.  A task could get a port to the nameserver from
the Mach kernel and ask it for a port (with send right) to a server
that registered itself with the nameserver at some earlier time.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Hurd, there is no nameserver.  Instead, the filesystem is used
as the server namespace.  This works because there is always a root
filesystem in the Hurd (remember that the Hurd is a POSIX compatible
system); this is an assumption the people who developed Mach couldn't
make, so they had to choose a different strategy.  You can use the
function hurd_file_name_lookup, which is part of the C library, to get
a port to the server belonging to a filename.  Then you can start to
send messages to the server in the usual way.

      The C library itself does not have a full list of all available
servers.  Instead pathname resolution is used to traverse through a
tree of servers.  In fact, filesystems themselves are implemented by
servers (let us ignore the chicken and egg problem here).  So all the
C library can do is to ask the root filesystem server about the
filename provided by the user (assuming that the user wants to resolve
an absolute path), using the
      <samp>
       dir_lookup
      </samp>
      RPC.  If the
filename refers to a regular file or directory on the filesystem, the
root filesystem server just returns a port to itself and records that
this port corresponds to the file or directory in question.  But if a
prefix of the full path matches the path of a server the root
filesystem knows about, it returns to the C library a port to this
server and the remaining part of the pathname that couldn't be
resolved.  The C library than has to retry and query the other server
about the remaining path component.  Eventually, the C library will
either know that the remaining path can't be resolved by the last
server in the list, or get a valid port to the server in question.

      It should by now be obvious that the port returned by the server can
be used to query the files status, content and other information from
the server, if good remote procedure calls to do that are defined and
implemented by it.  This is exactly what happens.  Whenever a file is
opened using the C libraries
      <samp>
       open()
      </samp>
      call, the C library
uses the above pathname resolution to get a port to a server providing
the file.  Then it wraps a file descriptor around it.  So in the Hurd,
for every open file descriptor there is a port to a server providing
this file.  Many other C library calls like
      <samp>
       read()
      </samp>
      and
      <samp>
       write()
      </samp>
      just call a corresponding RPC using the port
associated with the file descriptor.

      So we don't have a single phone book listing all servers, but rather a
tree of servers keeping track of each other.  That's really like
calling your friend and asking for the phone number of the blond girl
at the party yesterday.  He might refer you to a friend who hopefully
knows more about it. Then you have to retry.
     </p>
     <p>
      This mechanism has huge advantages over a single nameserver.  First,
note that standard unix permissions on directories can be used to
restrict access to a server (this requires that the filesystems
providing those directories behave).  You just have to set the
permissions of a parent directory accordingly and provide no other way
to get a server port.
     </p>
     <p>
      But there are much deeper implications.  Most of all, a pathname never
directly refers to a file, it refers to a port of a server.  That
means that providing a regular file with static data is just one of
the many options the server has to service requests on the file port.
A server can also create the data dynamically.  For example, a server
associated with
      <samp>
       /dev/random
      </samp>
      can provide new random data
on every
      <samp>
       io_read()
      </samp>
      on the port to it.  A server
associated with
      <samp>
       /dev/fortune
      </samp>
      can provide a new fortune
cookie on every
      <samp>
       open()
      </samp>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      While a regular filesystem server will just serve the data as stored
in a filesystem on disk, there are servers providing purely virtual
information, or a mixture of both.  It is up to the server to behave
and provide consistent and useful data on each remote procedure call.
If it does not, the results may not match the expectations of the user
and confuse him.
     </p>

     <p>
      Because a server installed in the filesystem namespace translates all
filesystem operations that go through its root path, such a server is
also called "active translator".  You can install translators using
the settrans command with the
      <samp>
       -a
      </samp>
      option.

     <p>
      Many translator settings remain constant for a long time.  It would be
very lame to always repeat the same couple of dozens settrans calls
manually or at boot time.  So the Hurd provides a filesystem extension
that allows to store translator settings inside the filesystem and let
the filesystem servers do the work to start those servers on demand.
Such translator settings are called "passive translators".  A passive
translator is really just a command line string stored in an inode of
the filesystem.  If during a pathname resolution a server encounters
such a passive translator, and no active translator does exist already
(for this node), it will use this string to start up a new translator
for this inode, and then let the C library continue with the path
resolution as described above.  Passive translators are installed with
settrans using the
      <samp>
       -p
      </samp>
      option (which is already the
default).
     </p>
     <table border="1" cellpadding="5" width="100%">
      <tr>
       <td align="LEFT" valign="TOP">
        <p>
         Passive Translators:

         <li>

         </li>
         <li>

  one.
         </li>
         <li>
          Startup is transparent to the user.
         </li>
         <li>
          Startup happens the first time the server is needed.
         </li>
         <li>
          Are permanent across reboots (like file data).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </td>
      </tr>
     </table>
     <p>
      So passive translators also serve as a sort of automounting feature,
because no manual interaction is required.  The server start up is
deferred until the service is need, and it is transparent to the user.
     </p>
     <p>
      When starting up a passive translator, it will run as a normal process
with the same user and group id as those of the underlying inode.  Any
user is allowed to install passive and active translators on inodes
that he owns.  This way the user can install new servers into the
global namespace (for example, in his home or tmp directory) and thus
extend the functionality of the system (recall that servers can
implement other remote procedure calls beside those used for files and
directories).  A careful design of the trusted system servers makes
sure that no permissions leak out.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, users can provide their own implementations of some of
the system servers instead the system default.  For example, they can
use their own exec server to start processes.  The user specific exec
server could for example start java programs transparently (without
invoking the interpreter manually).  This is done by setting the
environment variable
      <samp>
       EXECSERVERS
      </samp>
      .  The systems default
exec server will evaluate this environment variable and forward the
RPC to each of the servers listed in turn, until some server accepts
it and takes over.  The system default exec server will only do this
if there are no security implications.  (XXX There are other ways to
start new programs than by using the system exec server.  Those are
still available.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Let's take a closer look at some of the Hurd servers.  It was already
mentioned that only few system servers are mandatory for users.  To
establish your identity within the Hurd system, you have to
communicate with the trusted systems authentication server
      <samp>
       auth
      </samp>
      .  To put the system administrator into control over
the system components, the process server does some global
bookkeeping.
     </p>
     <p>
      But even these servers can be ignored.  However, registration with the
authentication server is the only way to establish your identity
towards other system servers.  Likewise, only tasks registered as
processes with the process server can make use of its services.

consists of a set of effective user ids, a set of effective group ids,
a set of available user ids and a set of available group ids.  Any of
these sets can be empty.

      Finally, the auth server can establish the identity of a user for a
server.  This is done by exchanging a server port and a user identity
if both match the same rendezvous port.  The server port will be
returned to the user, while the server is informed about the id sets
of the user.  The server can then serve or reject subsequent RPCs by
the user on the server port, based on the identity it received from
the auth server.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anyone can write a server conforming to the auth protocol, but of
course all system servers use a trusted system auth server to
establish the identity of a user.  If the user is not using the system
auth server, matching the rendezvous port will fail and no server port
will be returned to the user.  Because this practically requires all
programs to use the same auth server, the system auth server is
minimal in every respect, and additional functionality is moved
elsewhere, so user freedom is not unnecessarily restricted.

      The process server is responsible for some global bookkeeping.  As
such it has to be trusted and is not replaceable by the user.
However, a user is not required to use any of its service.  In that
case the user will not be able to take advantage of the POSIXish
appearance of the Hurd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mach Tasks are not as heavy as POSIX processes.  For example,
there is no concept of process groups or sessions in Mach.  The proc
server fills in the gap.  It provides a PID for all Mach tasks, and
also stores the argument line, environment variables and other
information about a process (if the mach tasks provide them, which is
usually the case if you start a process with the default
      <samp>
       fork()
      </samp>
      /
      <samp>
       exec()

      ).  A process can also register
a message port with the proc server, which can then be requested by
anyone.  So the proc server also functions as a nameserver using the
process id as the name.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proc server also stores some other miscellaneous information not
provided by Mach, like the hostname, hostid and system version.
Finally, it provides facilities to group processes and their ports
together, as well as to convert between pids, process server ports and
mach task ports.

      We already talked about translators and the file system service they
provide.  Currently, we have translators for the ext2, ufs and iso9660
filesystems.  We also have an nfs client and an ftp filesystem.
Especially the latter is intriguing, as it provides transparent access
to ftp servers in the filesystem.  Programs can start to move away
from implementing a plethora of network protocols, as the files are
directly available in the filesystem through the standard POSIX file
interface.

      The Hurd server protocols are complex enough to allow for the
implementation of a POSIX compatible system with GNU extensions.
However, a lot of code can be shared by all or at least similar
servers. For example, all storage based filesystems need to be able to
read and write to a store medium splitted in blocks. The Hurd comes
with several libraries which make it easy to implement new servers.
Also, there are already a lot of examples of different server types in
the Hurd.  This makes writing a new server easier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <samp>
       libdiskfs
      </samp>
      is a library that supports writing store based
filesystems like ext2fs or ufs. It is not very useful for filesystems
which are purely virtual, like
      <samp>
       /proc
      </samp>
      or files in
      <samp>
       /dev
      </samp>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      <samp>
       libnetfs
      </samp>
      is intended for filesystems which provide a rich
directory hierarchy, but don't use a backing store (for example ftpfs,
nfs).
     </p>
     <p>
      <samp>
       libtrivfs
      </samp>
      is intended for filesystems which just provide
a single inode or directory. Most servers which are not intended to
provide a filesystem but other services (like
      <samp>
       /servers/password
      </samp>
      ) use it to provide a dummy file, so
that file operations on the servers node will not return errors. But
it can also be used to provide meaningful data in a single file, like
a device store or a character device.

         Another very useful library is libstore, which is used by all store

     <p>
      <samp>
       libstore
      </samp>
      provides a store abstraction, which is used by
all store based filesystems. The store is determined by a type and a
name, but some store types modify another store rather than providing
a new store, and thus stores can be stacked. For example, the device
store type expects a Mach device, but the remap store expects a list
of blocks to pick from another store, like remap:1+:device:hd2, which
would pick all blocks from hd2 but the first one, which skipped.
Because this functionality is provided in a library, all libstore
using filesystems support many different store kinds, and adding a new
store type is enough to make all store based filesystems support it.
