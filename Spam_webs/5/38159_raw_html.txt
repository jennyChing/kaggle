        Have you ever received a call from someone with a heavy Indian accent from Microsoft saying your computer had errors or viruses? The purpose of these calls is to get an easy $299 (or whatever amount they choose) by scaring you into thinking theres something really wrong with your computer and that they can fix it for you.
       </p>
       <p>
        These telephony scams have been going on for many years and scammers keep robbing innocent people sadly because their success ratio is still worth their time and effort. It happens that I got the call while minding my own business on a regular work day. I immediately recognized what this was all about and decided to play the game to see how far this would go.
        <span id="more-849">

       </p>
       <p>
        The callers number did not appear on my phone, a sign that they were using some Voice over IP (VoIP) or such technology that both completely hides their identity and costs them nothing for long distance calls.
       </p>
       <p>
        This scam is a well-oiled machine which starts off with the alleged Microsoft representative asking you to turn on your computer to perform some checks for errors. They essentially make you open different applications which arent typically known by regular users.
       </p>

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        I was instructed to press the Windows and R as in Robert keys together to get to the Windows Run dialog box. They then made me type a few more keys to open up Windows Event Viewer:

       </p>
       <p>
        Conveniently, the event viewer will always show some warning or error which the scammer can leverage to instill fear. You can see it in your own eyes, she continued before asking me to count how many I could see. While we could have stopped right there, she was intent on pursuing the diagnostic further.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next stop was Windows Prefetch files:

       <p>
        The interesting thing about this is that she called those files spyware and viruses so we went from my computer having some errors to being infected. Yet another lie, as those

        </a>
        files are simply used by Windows to launch programs faster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bad things come in threes, as I was now instructed to open the System Configuration Utility, also known as msconfig.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a data-rel="lightbox-3" href="https://blog.malwarebytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/msconfig.png">

         Figure4: Msconfig showing services
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        She made me focus on the status of each Service and asked me once again to count how many stopped ones there were. When I gave her a ball park number, she retorted: You are just guessing, I want you to count.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this point I was ready to beg her to stop and she seemed to think it was enough convincing, that I was ripe enough to move on to the next step. She kindly asked me if I wanted to remediate all these problems and I accepted it. Other than the blatant lies, she had not been too pushy and to her credit gave me the option to decline assistance.
       </p>

        <b>
         Step 2: the intervention
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The next part consisted of getting a remote person to fix these issues for me. To give them access to my computer I had to download a program called TeamViewer which is totally legitimate software used by many companies and individuals to remote into somebody elses machine.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a data-rel="lightbox-4" href="https://blog.malwarebytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/teamviewer.png">

       </p>
       <p>
        At this point she asked me for the ID and password before telling me she was going to transfer me to her supervisor. I believe this next persons role is to process victims and to ensure payment goes through. The man on the phone also had a thick Indian accent and sounded quite professional. He told me a remote technician (which quite likely was also him) was ready to get working on my computer but he could not proceed until I actually instructed him to. I think this might be another technique used to cover themselves, as in I willingly asked them to help me. I felt like asking if I should say open sesame but instead I refrained from a cheap joke at their expense and asked what the secret word was. He told me to type renew my warranty to the technician.

        Sean the technician was more than eager to help me but the first thing he did was to open my browser to PayPals website so that I could pay the required lifetime fee of $299.

        At that point, I decided to change my mind and no longer wanted to pay so much money for such a ridiculous scam. So instead I entered a wrong Credit Card number to buy some time.

        After a few other failed attempts I could see the guys were starting to lose patience and then, out of the blue, something very bad happened. Without saying a word, the remote Microsoft Technician minimized the PayPal window and took on a mission to destroy all my personal files:

        I could not believe my eyes. He went on exploring directories in search of other things to remove as fast as he could. When he could not find anything else worthy he could delete, he typed his last message:

       <p>
        As this happened, I was still on the line with the supervisor, one of the scammers identity, to whom I recounted what had just happened. Im not sure whether it was the language barrier between I (a French man) and him but he solemnly said: if the technician says something, it must be right. The technician is always correct. Shortly after, the line was dead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike many other people (who turn the tables against the scammers by wasting their time) I had entered this phone call with a nice and open state of mind. I wasnt going to play tricks on them or make fun of them. I just wanted to see for myself how the scam was conducted and learn more about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having seen my fair share of deceptive marketing practices and software over the years, I can say a personal phone call is probably one of the cruelest tricks to play on an innocent victim. It is far too easy to fool someone by showing them errors and label them as extremely severe. With a sales clerk in a computer store one day trying to teach me what viruses were and why I so badly needed to purchase an antivirus, this experience ranks high up there in the you dont have a clue who you are talking to category.
       </p>
       <p>
        While they may legally be walking a fine line with all their sweet talking and magic passphrases, they crossed that line when they deleted documents on my computer and sabotaged the Internet connection. This is destruction of private property plain and simple. At the end of the day, I havent really lost any documents since this was a Virtual Machine and not an actual computer. One thing I lost though, was my faith in mankind, not that there was much of it left anyway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since these scammers use all sorts of tricks and fake identities, one of the best ways to ruin their business is simply to make it unworthy by spreading the message around so people dont fall for these scams. Easier said than done because it is touching on things like human nature, social engineering, fear and scare tactics: basically things that have worked for thousands of years. But even if we can make a dent in their profits, lets do it!
       </p>
       <p>
        Ive recorded this scam and uploaded it to YouTube. A minute into the call, I fired up a VM, put the phone on speaker mode and captured everything that was happening.

              This happened to me too, they got nowhere. I told them that I have just reformatted the drive &amp; that there was no way there could be any issues with it. I remember telling them something &amp; the woman couldnt understand what I was saying, it was then that I heard a clearly distinctive male Australian voice tell her what I said, he was obviously listening in on the progress. Some people have no morals, oh well, I guess the rule of thumb is,stay sharp, &amp; dont let anyone remote access your PC unless your 100% sure that the user is legit.

              Thank you so much for making this video available!! I almost got scammed by these people, but disconnected my pc from my wifi the second they insisted on me paying them a fee with a credit card. I have posted this on fb and have also asked others to post and share this scam. Thank you once again Pieter for taking the time to upload this for other unsuspecting potential victims. These crooks are parasites and need to be exterminated!

              Just got a call from a technical support team associate with a very heavy Indian accent claiming to be from Microsoft and calling to inform me of a new bug they needed to help me clear that would effect my internet. Told him that there was positively nothing wrong with my comp as I just had it checked and tuned up at Staples (which of course is complete BS ) What clued me into this being a scam is that he called my cell and the number on the caller id showed as 900-158. He kept on trying to prompt me to turn on my comp and I told him he is scamming the wrong guy. This went on for about two minutes before he finally said go f*** yourself and hung up.

              I got a similar call yesterday (7/24/13) from John a man with heavy Indian accent, who assured me he was with the Microsoft Technical Team and stated that my computer was corrupted by online infections and needed immediate attention.  Although reluctant, I bought his tale because an hour or so earlier I had received a message on my laptop screen that the hard drive was failing and that I should back it up immediately and seek help to repair or replace the drive.  I was in the middle of running Windows Backup when the call came in.
             </p>
             <p>
              I dont know if this was a coincidence, or if John had managed to send a virus to my pc that resulted in the failing drive warning.  After he went through the usual routine to convince me, he turn me over to the Engineer, who was nothing more than a paddler.  He had an oriental accent (possibly Chinese) and stated his name was Gary Walters.  He asked me to pay $125 for a one year subscription or $500 for lifetime service
             </p>
             <p>
              By then I was sure this was a scam and I asked him for the name of his company, to which he replied CallYourTech.  He attempted to pull it up (I had already given him remote control of my pc), but instead of CallYourTech he loaded PCHelpAndSuppot.  When I brought it to his attention he said this was the mother company and that CallYourTech was a subsidiary.  To buy time I asked Gary if I could get back with him the following day (today) since I needed time to think about it, mainly because I was contemplating buying a new computer He reluctantly gave me his phone number (216) 260-xxxx after I assured him that I would indeed call him. I wander if I am not exposing myself to more trouble (virus, hacking, etc.) if I were to follow through with the call.  In all likelihood he will call me back himself, unless if he reads this post

              I have received three calls, they never give up  even went so far as to finally connect me with the top manager -Neil Paul, who advised he was somewhat famous around there.
              <br/>

              Just got a call with the same scam this afternoon.  They, unfortunately, found me already in a stressed mood.  The Indian accented caller (who said his name was Fred), told me that my computer was unable to connect to windows update but, never fear, he could help.  I played along for a minute.  He had me press windows plus r and asked me what I saw.  (Remember, I was stressed)  He asked me what I saw and I gasped and said that I only see two letters  F and U.  He questioned me, thinking he had not heard me right.  I repeated, I only see two letters, F and U.  Then I went on a rant about scamming senior citizens and needing a real job.  He then told me that, Im coming for you. After that, he hung up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Granted, I should have just hung up, but I was in a bad mood and he just made it worse.  Interesting that he would threaten me, though.  Seems scammers are getting their feelings hurt lately.

              There seems to be a disturbing new trend when I receive these calls. The caller id says Private Caller, so I answer because some people I know come up like that on caller id. When you dont comply with their directions, they curse at you and hang up. The guy I got tonight was James (or so I think, it was hard to understand him). He kept saying turn on your computer, okay? When I refused, he yelled then you will lose your computer. When I said I didnt think so, he yelled f y and hung up.

              I have had this call 4 times. Three times, I hung up, the 4th time decided to play along. He asked me to look for a windows logo on my monitor, bottom left. I didnt see the logo. He asked me to look at the top. Again, I said I did not see it. He asked me to use my keyboard, press the windows logo, and R at the same time. I said it did nothing. He was getting frustrated with me. He said I had to do it at the same time. Again, it did nothing, I told him. He then said I should click on the stack menu. I explained I had no idea what that was. He then asked if I saw anything on my monitor. Yes, I said I did. He asked what I saw  In the upper left corner, I see a cute little apple icon. He hung up on me.

              HA! This just happened to me. Well, not this exactly. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stayed on the phone a while to see where it was gonna go. When he directed me to the teamviewer website, I bailed. They tried calling back about 6 times in the next 2 minutes and I disconnected each time. Very persistent, very annoying.

              I have caller ID, and have been getting many calls from int national, which I never answer, as its all scammers!  But this time I decided to!  Scarily they knew my name and address, said there calling from Microsoft. I asked which country, he had a heavy accent, which he tried to make sound like American! LOL!
              <br/>
              He told me I had some virus and he was calling to help me.  I told him I knew its a scam and doesnt he feel bad for trying to scam people, and how does he sleep at night, he told me to Shut up, I told him to shut him, and I put the phone down.  He called back again, told me to shut up, and I put the phone down on him.  I then decided to play along with their game, so when he called back, I said politely that I want to speak to the Manager, and he put me thru to someone else, who said they were a supervisor, I  said to him that his employee had been rude to me, for which he apologised, I asked where they were calling from and he said his calling from UK, (funny he had a odd american accent too), I prompted him more, and he said his calling from Midland House, Luton, LU1 2DW, UK.  Theyve obviously done their homework, I said before I continue any more with the call I will check this address out and he said hell call me back once I had checked it out.  The address to my surprise does existwhich might convince some people but I knew it was a scam address.  I said to him, can I ask you one question, he said yes, so I asked what religion are you, he said after hesitating Muslim, I said you know its Eid tomorrow and its Ramadan, so during this time, you have to be a good muslim, not lie, be of good thoughts, so if your are lying to me, then that is not good, he said no Im not lying to you.  And I just thought, well I tried but these people have no morals.  You cant make them feel bad as they dont care they are scamming people.  He tried calling back twice, but I really could not be bothered to take the scamming call again!  this people are vile.

              Just got called twice this morning and let him go through his pitch. While he claimed that they received error messages from my computer he would not tell me what they were. He went through the same exact process as described above and when he came to have me type in the www.teamviewer.com I countered with telling him I am with the police department and have been monitoring their activities, have there phone number, and that they have to cease and desist in their illegal activities and that they will be prosecuted and fined for what they are doing. He replied that there is nothing illegal that he is doing and if I know their phone number to tell him what it is. I repeated that he needs to stop this deceptive calling. He then proceeded to have me once again look at all the errors in my computer and persisted that I type in www.teamviewer.com !!! I just kept repeating that what he is doing is illegal and he cursed at me a few times and then finnaly hung up.
              <br/>
               Does anyone know how to get the info on these guys or how to pull a sting on them?

My phone rings 5 minutes later, and its a new guy, I tell him right away to stop calling me or I will call the cops and he says, *** you *****, Im your daddy and I just finished *******. Ummm. WHAT?!? I seriously laughed, told him good luck with that, and that my mom called and told me she couldnt find his *******. They havent called back yet.  *******

              I just had them on the phone this morning , telling me they were calling from Microsoft Support and saying that my computer had reported viruses to them. I was a little suspicious and questioned them on how they could link my computer to the phone number they were calling me on , to which the man just said something about showing me the errors.
              <br/>
              At this point I decided the call was some sort of scam and told him that I would not carry on speaking to him, so he tells me that I should stop wasting his time  very rich from someone who just cold called me. Im glad I found this site to confirm my suspicions

              I just got a call from these guys.
              <br/>
              It was hilarious.
              <br/>
              I was able to keep them on the phone for 45 minutes while I put the phone down to go to the other room where the computer was.
              <br/>
              The 3rd operator was losing patience with me after 15 minutes, but he kept trying, and I kept getting his instructions wrong and would come back on the phone to get the instructions again, writing everything down, again!
              <br/>
              They thought I was an idiot.
              <br/>
              After 45 minutes, and he was shouting, I said I have to go now. Im a doctor and they need me at the hospital.
              <br/>
              He screamed, Youre a doctor???? I couldnt understand the rest of his rantings.
              <br/>
              I hung up letting him hear me laughing.

              Last post is a riot!! I am still laughing. I received a call earlier today from a private number and was told that they were calling from Windows because they received reports from my computer that there were errors that needed to be fixed now or else I would lose my computer later. I spent the first five minutes asking him to identify himself and his company. Finally, after a lot of spelling, I learned that his company was A1 Techsquad and #646-915-1375 (and someone actually answered the phone). Yes, he did have a heavy Indian accent. My suspicion began immediately after I saw a private number calling. No proper business should be calling anyone from a private number. Then he tried to get me to open up my computer but I bluntly told him that wasnt going to happen and I wasnt interested in fixing anything on my computer. My thought was that you shouldnt know anything that was happening on my computer.

              Got such phone just like 15 minutes ago.
              <br/>
              I was not aware such scams  were happening  I mean its so easy to expose them.
              <br/>
              1) if Microsoft was calling, they would upfront identify themselves specifically, instead the caller just say his same and asks for the person responsible for the home computer. That is a total lack of professionalism, if this was Microsoft or anyone on a mission for Microsoft, they would volunteer their identification without waiting to be asked. Instead, I had to ask and all the say is a company name, but do not volunteer any information that would identify them specifically. A real Microsoft related business would.
              <br/>
              2) Microsoft calling you to tell you that your computer has a virus??? Microsoft has 200M customers  how many phone calls would they have to do each day????? Are you kidding me?
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Ask this simple question, I always do to any business which calls my home phone number. How did you get my phone number? 
              <br/>
              Think about it how do they know what phone number to call ? If this was true, it would mean Microsoft has a record with the phone number of where you use your computer. Sorry, I never gave my home phone number to Microsoft .. I rarely register software, but if I do, I use my cell phone, certainly not the home phone, because I dont want businesses to call my home phone, which I cant turn off, the cell phone .. I just disconnect it after 8pm, My friends know that, they call home
             </p>
             <p>
              Question. is there some software that could be used to track them down?
              <br/>
              anyway .. I told the guy not to tell rubbish and to never ever dare calling my phone number again. I was close to go into my closet and take the Paperik costume out to go on a punitive mission  then I thought I dont have tomahack missiles I wish I did!

              Hi Paolo, you make some good points and thanks for sharing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding your question, it depends on the software they use to remote into your PC. In some cases you may be able to go into the logs for that program and identify an IP address, but thats kind of a hit and miss.
             </p>
             <p>
              Otherwise, you can do a reverse social-engineering and have them visit a webpage that will log their IP address and other info.
             </p>

              I am getting so sick and tired of these people!!!  Nothing stops them  if you tell them that you know its a scam, they get rude, swear and call me a liar (for what, Im not sure?).  Their phone number comes across as Unavailable so I cant track them back.  I am involved in finding my missing grandson so I need to answer every call so this is extremely frustrating for me.  The only thing that seems to stop them (albeit only for a week or so) is a really loud whistle blown long and hard.  One more deaf scammer!

              I was eating dinner, so I just called the guy an a-hole and said my Windows computer couldnt be generating spam or whatever because I had a Mac. If they call again, I will try to waste their time by going through Windows instructions which of course wont work.

              I live in a small community and they have hit here lately.Some have taken the bait and learned the hard way. So far we have been able to recover the money lost and saved the computers.If these types of scams are world wide there should be measures to take to stop these guys.Somebody thinks this kind of scams is not high enough on the list to seek out and stop. Thats sad. I like the idea of blasting them with an air horn or whistle. I myself lowered all morals and told them I hoped that the us marshall service would kick thier doors down and shoot them in the head.Didnt fix anything but I felt better for a moment. LOL

              Unfortunately I did get scammed. My comp was having problems at the time.I only lost 100.00.To this day I keep getting their calls. The last one that called was female which was different as it always was a man. I wouldnt do what she wanted and was getting mad.. I told her she was scamming and to F**** off. She started to yell and swear at me. Lastly I told her to go F*** a camel and hung up. Well 5 mins later her supervisor called me and wanted to know if the was my usual way to speak to people. So he got choice words tossed at him. I have never been called by a person, but around the same time of they use to call, I now get a call dead air. So I never answer phone around that time. They finaly quit.My brother also gets these calls. He still stone age, no comp. He told him they were loading the plane right now, as he works for the army. They were going to capture him, cut head of and poop down neck hole. Guy hung up!!

              I love these guys.
              <br/>
              Just had one call here  I wasted his time with stupid questions and keyboard fumbling for about 40mins  then when at the crucial point of remoteing into my machine  I told him that I was just playing games with him and told him he was a low life scumbag who prayed on the innocent and computer illiterate. His reply was great f*** off  sorry I didnt catch that  is said  again he repeated f*** off at which point I just bust out laughing and he hung up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cant wait for the next call. this is so much fun I loved it

              The first time this happened to me, I was rather dismayed.  Once I figured out what was going on, I began to have fun with it.  I would invent a new anti-scam to get back at them each time.  It always helped to play dumb at first, then gradually get smarter as the call progressed.  They usually get extremely irate once they figure out that they have been played.  I am not surprised and delighted to read that others are yanking their chains as well.  I truly hope they continue to call as I find it endlessly entertaining.

              This very thing happened to me last night. My home computer has not been on for weeks. I just use the one at work. So this Indian fellow calls at 9pm and I can see from the caller id on the TV (I have time warner digital phone) that it is international. They had called the night before and I usually never answer my phone but this time I decided to find out who it was. And this young Indian sounding guy is urging me to look at my computer because he is from Microsoft and they keep getting messages that something is wrong with my computer. And he sounds like this is very urgent and  that I am in jeopardy. So I say to him What are you talking about?, My computer has not been on in weeks. and he says, But weve been getting messages. Thats when I realized it was probably a scam and so I say to him Go to ****. You are a &amp;%^*$@!. and I hung up. Then a few minutes later another call from a different but similar number. I pick up and it is dead silence. I would love to be able to report them but it seems to me that they cover their tracks very well. And our own police department probably cannot do anything. So all I can say is that I am glad by bs antennae were up last night and I did not fall for their tricks. The guy on the phone sounded so amateurish and stupid that I doubt he ever gets any takers but Im sure they have others that sound professional and do get pretty far.

              They just called my house for the umpteenth millionth time.  I was sick of it and asked to speak to a supervisor.  He then proceeded to ignore the scripted parts of his usual spiel and make sexually derogatory and harassing comments.  I tried  call trace but that, of course, availed me nothing.  Is there a way to track these jerks?  Is there anything that can be done?

              I just now got this call from them and when they said something about paying a fee to reactivate my Windows license, I became immediately suspicious and declined.  Though I was suspicious the moment the person on the other end started talking, so I kept going out of curiosity.  Silly scammers, tricks are for kids!  LOL

              Michael, with a heavy Indian accent called me tonight.  Provided me with his phone number 732-579-6288 to call him back.  Unfortunately when I told him it was a business computer and I would let our IT department know and have them call him he said that business computers were not eligible for his service. LOL.

              Last Saturday I received a call from Brian, with the stereotypical Indian accent. He informed me my computer was infected, but that he could help me. I followed his instructions as to which keys to push. Responded in the affirmative when he asked if I saw a certain number or box. I feigned concern over losing my machine or suffering irreparable damage. I guess he finally knew I was on to him when he asked what I saw on my screen and I told him a baseball game. I then informed him that I was certain my computer was not infected and that he was running a fraud because I dont own a computer. He denied any fraudulent intentions. I asked him what part of Pakistan, India, or Bangladesh he was calling from and he told me he was with Techsolvers of Albany, New York. He didnt cuss me, but simply hung up. These folks are fun, if you have the time to waste with them. But I could see how someone might be fooled into giving them money or access to sensitive personal information. This guy did have my correct street address, but you can get that anywhere. Reminded me of the credit card scammer who threatened to cancel all my cards when I told him he was a crook. I said, You wont even tell me which cards you are trying to lower my interest rates on, so you dont know, and cant cancel (S-word). I used to hang up on telemarketers, now I try to make them hang up on me.

              They havent quit  and probably wont I suppose.   I got the call at supper time tonight, same basics as written above about being from Windows.  I kept them at bay for 35 minutes or so pretending my computer was super slow and was still downloading, etc.  After a bit the technician gave up on trying to get me into

              where it wouldnt load either while I whined away how slow my computer had become and cried about how worried I was and hoping they could help me.   I filled in some of the waiting time by asking where he was calling from (Washington), what the weather was like (cloudy), his name (Ron Wilson), and his employee number (0013).   If you believe this info I have a nice international bridge between Canada and the United States that Im willing to sell at a reasonable price.  I asked if he knew where I was and he said Canada  Ontario, and then added something about a lot of snow  well, maybe in a couple of months.  I dont know how much longer I could have kept it going but my time was running out so I did the usual Police will like the tape of this and the call ended.
              <br/>
              One thing to keep in mind: its not just the letting them scam you out of some money for a service thats not needed; its not just that they might wipe some files.  If you let them have access to your computer they can add files and programs like keyboard scanners which can then give them access to bank passwords, etc etc etc.
              <br/>
              Beware.  Beware.  Beware

              I had a call like that once from an Indian guy saying he was ringing from the technical maintenance department of your computer.  I told him I knew it was a scam and that Id be contacting the police and hung up on him.

              A friend received a call like that from a woman saying that he had viruses on your computer.  He asked how she knew and she said she could see it over the Internet.  He told her it wasnt connected to the Internet and wasnt even turned on.  She hung up on him.

              I got one of those calls about a week ago.  Mild Indian accent, Anglicized name.  He started the same script.  From Windows. Trying to tell me about the messages that his phony server was getting,  showing that there are errors on my computer.   I knew it was a scam so I just told him,  no, my computer was  working just fine and that I run anti-malware, anti-spyware and McAfee anti-virus programs often and I keep them up to date. Then he just hung up.  What I dont understand is how these guys can expect to be successful scamming,  when they come across with a strong accent and an Anglicized name.  Mine was Robert Johnson.  The women are worse when it comes to understanding what they are saying.   I heard one  once,  that literally sounded like she was singing in a Bollywood musical!

              A dothead using a Chinese name and claiming to be calling from Austin, Tx tried to pull this scam on me tonight. I played along for 15 minutes, then trashed him and all his relatives and hung up. Believe it or not, he called me back, asking me why I didnt trust his kind.

              I just had the scam call referenced above.  Same scenario except I didnt trust the initial caller so I asked for a phone number and website.  Checked the website and it doesnt exist (www.webstoreshop.com)  Also disconnected my system from the internet before I did the eventviewer the first caller walked me through. What made me suspicious was I have all my computers notifying me before an error message is sent to MS. I authorize the message so they should not have any error records.  The caller claimed there is an automatic message sent.  Then I asked what the error message stated and he couldnt give me any info.  I disconnected from the internet after that to prevent remote access (Wasnt sure I turned off remote access in windows).
              <br/>
              Would like to figure a way to squelch callers like this.
              <br/>
              Thanks for your blog on this, saved me time, frustration and provided some reassurance about being suspicious.

              Wow, some of these stories  too funny; to the author of the article, thank you for diagramming and outlining your experience! Extremely informative and very helpful! Ive been receiving these calls for the past few days but didnt answer. I wanted to do some research on the suspicious numbers first. Glad I did too. From what I read, it seemed like an easy way to get a good laugh, if nothing else.
             </p>
             <p>
              Havent really messed with anyone for a long time, but when I learned what this was, I decided to conduct an experiment. Also, Im almost positive that the mother of one of my friends had fallen for this same scam about a year ago. Certainly sounds the same.
             </p>
             <p>
              She paid $300.00 at first, then *more* money, and even more. Had recurring issues with her computer but was unable to contact them. Eventually, she understood what they were and has been unsuccessful in blocking them. They just call from other numbers. This, to me, is *so* sad, OMGosh, such a travesty!
             </p>
             <p>
              I, too, have lost most of my faith humanity; it seems like everyones out to make a quick, unethical buck these days *sigh* and would *so love* to shut these guys down! Anyway, to finish my comment (sorry so long) they called again today (on October 25, 2013). This time, I answered.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was Steve from Windows (I think thats what he said) calling to inform me that the malware and errors in my computer were causing it to run slowly and that he, a software engineer (something like that) had the skills to repair my corrupted machine.
             </p>
             <p>
              This was it, an opportunity for something, and in a meek, little voice, I expressed fear to him, a what-should-I-do tone, and an attitude of total and complete trust. Wanted to see if Steve had any scruples and waited to see if he would continue.
             </p>
             <p>
              Would he feel bad or say, Never mind? Didnt wonder for long. Nope! He just directed me to go to my computer, press my Windows Key and the letter R at the same time, blah, blah, blah,  Long story short, while I wasted his time, had him call back several times due to Reasons A, B, and C. until it just got to be too late.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if hell call back tomorrow?
             </p>

              Peace,

              I am not a hater as my father immigrated from ITALY as a teenager.  But a large portion of these scams as well as sim of our unemployment issues could potentially be solved by keeping 100% of the tech support and assistance programs for apple, dell, Microsoft, etcin the US.  Yes people in the USA come from all races, ethnicities and such but at least knowing they are based in the US you could pick a scam a lot easier the second they call from overseas by knowing the support comes form the US and you could just hang up at that point.  India, China, Pakistan, etc where these scams come from, in addition to home grown and other scams, are hard to stop.  They can shut one down tomorrow and five more will start.  These guys are the PhDs of their field and they scramble IP addresses, reroute and falsifying their locations and hide under a veil of anonymity not possible a decade ago.  You cant stop them, track them or even prosecute them as they dont abide by our ethics, laws or cultural integrity.  The most you can do, as Ive seen other posts, is educate as many people as you can on how to turn off the faucet and not get pulled down the drain.  It may start with 300$ but it can end up costing your credit history  bank information and more.  Once they get into your stuff it can take you years to recover, and this is assuming the damage doesnt financially put you back into the fricken Stone Age.  Id love to catch em though.  Despite knowing its a scam and hanging up, itd be nice to get back at them for ruining my Sunday morning!!!

              These guys are unbelievable.  They called me a  month ago and as soon as they asked me to turn on my computer I hung up.  I only wish Id warned my mom &amp; Dad.  Senior citizens and not computer savvy, these hucksters told my mom her computer was infecting all the computers in the neighborhood and if she didnt give them access to clean it immediately they would shut it down and she might lose everything on it.  My mom gave them $500 before calling me to ask what I thought.  i told her to unplug it and disconnect it from the internet til I got there to help her fix it and to call her bank and stop payment on her credit card.  They called her back and said they were very concerned that her computer was not working. She said it was struck by lightning.  They said, Its not working at all? She said, Its smoking, and hung up.  Then they called her back SIX times!   Its horrible what they do to older people. I wouldnt play around with these people, theyre unhinged.  Good luck all.  Play nice in the sandbox:)

I asked them which computer, as i have a couple that I use..hahaha. and they got all flustered and put me on with the supervisor and was trying to do the same thing.hahahaha.I yelled at him which f*#king computer?! and they hung up on me.  Not very lady like but they were making me mad.  Thank you for your help on breaking down what they would have had me do.  Im thankful for your page!

              Bit of a new twist.  When they tried to get me to go to event viewer I refused and kept telling them there was nothing wrong with my computer, they kept arguing with melike a small child: yes there isthen told me my antivirus wasnt working correctly.  I asked them which anitvirus I was running and they said it doesnt matter.  I wasnt in the mood, nor did I have the time to have any fun with these people, so as I was hanging up on him I heard him say he would connect me to his supervisoras if that was proof.  But as soon as I put the phone down on its cradle, it rang again.  The person playing the part of the supervisor asked, How can I help you?   I told him I didnt need any help and hung up again.  I think next time, now that I know the details of how their game works, when they tell me my antivirus isnt working correctly, Ill tell them, oh, thats because Im running a botnet central control on that computer, so I cant have a working antivirus on there.  And thats why I didnt want him to see my event viewerand if you really want to help me, let me put your computer on my botnet.  But Ill need your credit card number first.

              I received yesterday call fromChristina with a heavy Indian accent. She asked if I have a computer, and that my profile is infected. I asked where she is from, and she told from Ifix technical support. She insisted that I go to my computer, and she tells me how to fix it. Well, I do not trust menkind, and told her that I have to leave home, and to give me her phone number, and Ill call her back. She did not do it, but asked me when she can call me again. So, she is going to call me on Monday. In the meantime, even though I was very suspicious about her good intention, and that she was truthful, I went on microsoft page, downloaded safety scanner, and scanned my computer. Even though I have Norton antivirus, but my computer was slowly lately, and I wanted make sure. I also wanted find something on internet about  what happend to me. Im very glad I found this information, extremely informative. How lucky I wasbrrrr.
              <br/>
              When Christina calls me on Monday, I plan to tell her, that my phone line is hooked with fbi, and they listen to her, and will talk to her about her fixing computers. Thank you for this information.

              I just had a phone call from someone with an Indian accent from Microsoft saying my computer is giving them hundreds of errors. The call was from Toronto and went through th same steps as they did with you, I did some playing myself but I did not go as far as you did. These guys are idiots.

              Same scam, same details more or less as at 20/11/13 in New Zealand. Could only manage to keep them on the phone for about 20 minutes before they cottoned on. Sure hope they call again soon

              I work in a law firm and habeeb and his Bangladeshi brothers call me once a week. First time they called they got angry with me for asking over and over which computer are you talking about I have multiple computers here and hung up the phone. Now they call back and always with a different name and keep insisting its my Home computer that is infected and showing signs of hacking activity.lets remember I work in a Law Firm with 10+ networked computerspick oneand still poor hageey cant tell me which on the 10+ computers is the infected one..though I do forget to mention to them I run on Linux so I find it absolutely hilarious that a  Microsoft Security Technician find a problem in my home computer at my work.

              They just tried me.  Even after I read them this article they still tried.  I had nothing better to do so I kept them talking until I had another call come in on the other line.  I work from home and I also kept asking over and over which of my 3 computer they where calling about. They want to fix my Window 8.  Being in the slow lane, I only have windows 7.  This still didnt deter him.  Funniest thing he said was that he was in DelawareHahah, loved the US accent.

              These guys just tried to scam me again. They pretty much try once a month. Usually I play with them for a while, but todays call was different. When I said I wasnt interested (as usual), the guy (I didnt catch the name he gave, his accent was so thick and he sounded like he was underwater) started shouting really disgusting, sexist, pornographic things about being able to smell my rotten vagina from there at me.  These calls have taken a really disturbing turn, and I wish there was a way to stop them.

              Sorry to hear that Claire. This kind of harassment is simply outrageous.

              Would you happen to remember their companys name?

              At first I would tell these guys to get lost and then hang up.  But then I realized that I can have some fun with them. Every five minutes that I distract them is five minutes away from a potential victim.   Here are two of my most recent calls with them.

              One is for a bogus website.

              I have just been scammed by these fraudsters today.I am still in shock after reading this.Everything described happened today and i have gave them my bank details.They scammed me for 10 only as I dont have any money being a single unemployed mum looking after my disabled son.They wanted over 100 from me and eventually settled for 10.They threatened to shut my computer down saying it was to badly infected to allow me to keep using it and they were getting messages sent from my pc all the time.After the threat is when I agreed to pay them 10 to stop them shutting my pc down.They told me they would sort out my hard drive which is in a critical condition in the red,and sort all the viruses out my pc !!of course they didnt.After the half hour getting what they wanted out of my pc I noticed they had installed a lot of rubbish money making programmes on my pc all added today.I am still trying to remove some of them.Should I contact my bank regarding this issue???They said they would phone me again in a couple of months time to check everything is ok with my pc after there so called fix.I dont know what to do!!!!

             </p>
             <p>

              A client of mine got hit with this yesterday. He is an elderly gentleman and he received a cold call from someone claiming to be with Windows Technical Support. They told him they could see that his computer had a load of errors on it and that if he allowed them remote access, they could fix it for him. After he allowed them access, he began to get nervous and he called me. I told him it was a scam and to power off his computer. He gave me the phone number they supplied him with and I called. (1-866-460-7455) It was answered by someone with a heavy Indian accent named Austin. Austin could not confirm with me his company name so I asked to speak with his supervisor. He agreed and after a moment, another Indian man came on the line, however he spoke with a garbled throat like he was sick. I am absolutely certain that this is the same person, as after continuing to speak with him, his voice cleared up and he sounded exactly like Austin. This time he claimed his name was John Martin. I asked why his technicians would cold call someone and tell them they have computer errors and how would he know that anyway? He said there must have been a communication error and that my client must have called them. I then asked to speak to his supervisor, but he refused to give me a name and number and when I insisted that if this were a legitimate company, then there should be no issue with him escalting my call to his immediate superior. He told me to go to **** and hung up. After a short internet search on the phone number I found that this number is associated with this scam. I am scheduled to visit my client tonight to see what, if any, damage may have been done in terems of installing malware or any trojans. People like this make me sick.

              Keep receiving these calls when visiting friends in the UK last year and this.  When it first happened, I had not heard of the scam, but  I used to work in IT for a BIG oil company  Microsofts biggest customer at the time  and you could never get MS to return a call even though we had a contract (!), so I was bally certain they wont be calling some random person out of the blue  seriously  like they would have time to do proactive support on the worlds  computers
              <img alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://blog.malwarebytes.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>
              Anyway, whilst carefully giving away no personal info. to them, I spent a happy 45 minutes asking them to tell me computer name,  who owned it, software version, model/make  as many people lived in the house, with many computers, so I really could not help them unless they told me   I spent a lot of time leaving them on hold whilst supposedly going off to check which computer it could be. How puzzling that they could identify an error on a computer but had no idea WHICH computer. yeah right.   There was a serious angle to this   I wanted to know is how much information they had i.e. was this a random call from a random number generator  or had they ANY personalised information (which would be more worrying).  Well pretty sure it was random, as they never revealed any additional information to enable me to assist them accessing the  right computer  eventually they got bored and went away.  But they do call back periodically though, sometimes over a year later, so never let down your guard.  They are now plaguing New Zealand too.  I alert all my non-technical friends to never open attachments/click on links unless the email sounds legit (and maybe not then either  until they check with the source), and just say NO to unsolicited offers of help.   And I remind them often!

              I got a similar call last week in Germany.I commented on their Indian accent, but they said, they were from Glasgow with Indian ancestors.
              <br/>
              Unfortunedly they caught me by surprise in am similar way as described above and I gave them access to my pc as I really had problems in the last time and a virus-search by avira had found more thn one virus a week ago.
              <br/>
              They asked me for 249US Dollars for an extension of a garanty.
              <br/>
              When I wanted to get a written confirmation of the terms the manager got angry and in the end I ended the call mysel after more than one hour. Half an hour later I disconnected the pc but later I found that they installed a password to start my windows XP.
              <br/>
              So till today I do not know, what damage they did to my documents and a professional is actually trying to get access to the pc. A linux boot disk did not work!

              Are you lot COMPLETELY insane? Why would you let some random stranger connect to your PC?  Even if you think you might know who they are, you should never let ANYONE connect to your PC.
              <br/>
              How the **** would someone know that your PC has problems? No remote person would know this. Only you or your antivirus software would ever know this.
              <br/>
              Aside from trying to get money out of you, they could install unwanted applications on your PC, which steal your cookies and session keys. They could install malware in the background which causes your PC to beacon out over the internet.  They can also install software called ransomware (look it up) so that you have no alternative but to pay them.

              Exercise some basic common sense here guys.
              <br/>

              I decided to make a script for you guys witch will catch there ip address and send you a email. If you have a website or if your looking to find a host and domain Google it. there are some free sites that do that.  Guys if you get a call like that again just play dumb and tell them yea i cant log into this site since yesterday because i have a virus. make something up. make shore thy go to the site where you put that script once thy go to that site hang up the phone, or play along.
              <br/>
              Here is a php script example  of what i am preparing for these guys hope to have these code ready for tomorrow or something

              This was very helpful.  I am sure glad I didnt log onto my computer as asked by the very nice woman with a heavy Indian accent asking me to.  My rule of thumb  if it is real they will give me their phone number to call back.  When I asked for the computer number they read off a long number with letters which sounded official and then asked me to log on to verify it.  I asked them for their phone number so I could call them back later at which point they hung up.
             </p>
             <p>
              I then came across your blog  which pretty much confirmed it was a scam.  Thank you for sharing

              Thanks for your comment patzy. Regarding the call back number that you mentioned, Im afraid its not a reliable means to determine if theyre real.
              <br/>
              On several occasions when I was having payment problems I was given a phone number to call back (it was one of their 1-800 #).
              <br/>
              One thing that may catch them off guard is to ask them what time it is in their supposed US office. One time I did that and I could hear the guy type in google to find that out. The fact that it took him 20 seconds to say it was 2 PM in Los Angeles was not a good sign

              I received the same basic scam the other night. I was able to get a couple of callback numbers out of them:
             </p>
             <p>
              * 1-855-539-4928
              <br/>
              * 1-855-539-4925
             </p>
             <p>
              Since it kind of frustrates me that outfits like this exist, I really wanted to think about how concerned citizens could take a place like this down. I called the numbers back tonight to prove they were indeed real and notice that they basically work until about 8:30  9:00 PM EST. I managed to string along the phone scammers for about 90 minutes calling back at various times to get someone else and go through the story again.
             </p>
             <p>
              This got me thinking that a simple technique might be for a lot of people to just overwhelm the call center with telephone calls claiming to be in need of their computer services, stringing them along for a while, and then abandoning the call. Theyre using toll-free phone numbers, so I assume they have to pay for each caller. Maybe if enough people fight back, it becomes unprofitable.

              Hello mbent,
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for the info you provided. The idea of overwhelming their call center could in theory work. However I still think theyd be able to get away with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              In my experience, Ive noticed that the same company rotates through phone numbers quite regularly. The same number that worked the day before would often be disconnected the next day or so.
              <br/>
              Another thing is that they blacklist peoples numbers as well. That happened to me when I call too many times (apparently) and my number got blocked from then on.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you can afford to waste their time, it is definitely going to hurt their sales ratio but you do have to be very careful when doing so. You should never let them take control of your computer because they have been known to see revenge and destroy files or install malware deliberately. One solution is to use a virtual machine which can be reset to a clean snapshot after the job is done. Even in that case, caution should be taken to make sure there are no network shares with other computers in your house.

              I am still shocked when I talk to a technician who without any hesitation goes straight for the lies. And I know that many people cannot tell what is true or not and may actually fall for the scam. At the end of the day these scams rake in so much money that these individuals really dont care. This is essentially modern day extortion

              I just got off the phone with these jokers.  They directed me to this website:
              <a href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/csrss/" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/csrss/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Could the owners of that site be in on the scam? Part of the scammers spiel was trying to convince me that the csrss.exe service is a trojan or some sort of malware. They basically pointed me to that site as proof that the service is harmful, which it really isnt according to legitimate sites.

              Hi Patsy Richey,
             </p>
             <p>
              The site liutilities.com as far as a I know, is not affiliated with scammers. The reason they use it is, as you said, you show you evidence about a so-called virus.
             </p>
             <p>
              Scammers will use various online glossaries, including wikipedia, and even have you read out loud what it says.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you check out this resource page (
              <a href="http://blog.malwarebytes.org/tech-support-scams/" rel="nofollow">
               http://blog.malwarebytes.org/tech-support-scams/
              </a>
              ) I built over time, you will see that I was also presented with the liutilities page for rundll32.exe once. Now, I do agree that when liutilities say that this file can be a trojan or backdoor it does sound scary In fact, it can sometimes be the case and that is what scammers are leveraging.
             </p>
             <p>
              All in all, its about borrowing legitimacy to convince a mark that its not just their word, but also that of wikipedia, Microsoft, etc

              I had a little bit of fun with these people. Went through the call, and at the point where the guy decided to mess my computer up, i inserted my usb stick that had a really cool virus on it. So basically as he was deleting my computer my virus killed the technicians computer because he opened the folder (it went across the link) it did murder my pc but it got one of theirs also. After that i had a very niceyell at from the supervisor because you maked our technicians computer no work lol hope they run into a few more people like me that have an awesome stick virus.

              This just happened to me too. Guy with a very thick accent said he was Windows support and they were receiving a high level of error reports from my computer. I had never heard of this scam, but knew right away its BS. First off, a legit employee wouldnt say they work for Windows would they? Theyd say they work for Microsoft. I let him give a spiel and instructions(which I pretended to follow) then I told him that I realize hes just on the hunt for people with little computer knowledge that he can take advantage of. I told him he was despicable and he started laughing! Still insisted that the error messages were legit and he was employed by A-1 Tech, an official affiliate of Windows. I just hung up on him at that point. I feel bad for the people that theyre able to scare money out of.

              Im an AM Radio talk show host of a computer/technology show in the mid-west and have warned my listeners repeatedly about such a scam.
             </p>
             <p>
              My aunt called me up one night saying she had just been called by someone claiming to be from Microsoft who is saying her PC is infected and they want to help her fix it.  She called me just after she connected them to her PC and they started running the scans.  She isnt the most tech savvy person but said that the call seemed fishy so she called me up to ask about it.  I told her to immediately disconnect the screen sharing program (she unplugged the ethernet cord from the back of the laptop and told the scammer that the power just went out in her house.) and hang up on the scammer.
             </p>
             <p>
              I went over, scanned her PC for infectionsjust in caseand just to be safe we used a restore point from the day before to roll back any changes the scammer may have made.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, I have never had them call me directly but my aunt gave me their numberso I was bored one day and decided to mess with sasquatch.
             </p>
             <p>
              I set up a PC I use for testing new operating systems on with an older copy of Ubuntu Linux and downloaded a theme that made it look exactly like a windows 7 computer.   I made a lot of other changes so if you go deeper into the start menu, it still would seem like you are in a windows PC.
             </p>
             <p>
              I then logged on as a regular user (not a power or super user) and proceeded to call the number.
             </p>
             <p>
              After talking with Mike and playing dumb on what he wanted me to do he asked me to install team viewer on my PC so he could remote in and show me the problems on my screen.  Ok, no problem (as team viewer has a linux version).  He didnt hand me off to anyone so an interesting variation from what is posted here but whatever.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once he was in, he tried to open system tools for event viewer.Yeah not exactly what he was expecting at all.  He seemed completely confused (and it was very hard not to laugh at his fumbling around and keep my voice sounding innocent and confused too) by this but then decided to run his own program on my PC to show me I have an infection.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those who are not techies: Windows programs will not natively work in Linux, you have to run them through a special program called Wine.  This guy tried everything but just couldnt get his program to run.  He tried opening a command prompt (and I modified my linux command prompt to look like a native windows prompt) and type commands in thereyeah, that confused him more.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was getting more and more frustrated with my PC and finally told me that my PC was beyond their help, disconnected team viewer and hung up on me.
             </p>
             <p>
              So much fun.

              Man, same guy, same voice! Just got off the phone with him, when he first called I actually believed him for a minute, he told me to open Run, and I forget what I typed in and he basically read me the number that was on the screen. At this point I had a feeling something was going on so I said it in a joking tone, are you trying to put **** on my computer. And hes like no sir Im not trying to put **** on your computer. And that gave it off, Microsoft techs do not swear.

              This happened to me. The caller had a thick Indian accent and identified himself as from Windows Security. He took me step by step through the process, which I pretended I was following, although I did not have a computer in front of me. I then asked him where he was calling from. He said again, Windows Security and that he had a record of my windows computer sending error messages to his help centre. He put up a brave fight, I have to say. I suggested to him that he should come up with a better company name than Windows Security, and that my windows security was likely to be just fine, seeing as I was running a mac operating system. He hung up the phone.

              I am by no means usually this unaware  but am very tired and not so well so I think they caught me at a weak moment.  It followed exactly the thread above and I gave them access.  They got to the point of trying to sell me the product where I then twigged how wrong this was and I asked for a moment to look something up  coincidentally your blog came up and they could see this.  They then took control of my mouse however I yanked my internet cable before they could get into my security setting (well hopefully) and at the same time the person hung up.  My laptop is now doing a full norton scan as I type on my iPad  the quick scan came up clear.  My question is  I  have just changed the major passwords, laptop, email, banking, Facebook etc  is that enough?  How foolish do I feel!!!

              My wife and I got a phone call today from a guy stating he was from Microsoft, and stated that we had problems with our computer, This as been going on for a long time we get phone calls from these people. Today he picked the wrong time to phone me, As he tried to talk to me, Before he could finish his little speech I told him to F-Off and hung up. Right after I hung up on him he phoned back 3 more time, not saying anything and hanging up on me, the third time phoned he phoned back using the same number as the first time and, called me a Mother- Fer, and was screaming at me, I told never to call again or he can deal with the Police. Here are the phone numbers he used
             </p>
             <p>
              1-971-555-0129 this number was the main one he used twice.
              <br/>
              1-913-951-0808 he hung up on me.
              <br/>
              1-206-555-0114 he hung up on me.

              Hi Brig,
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry to hear about your experience but so glad you found this site and avoided more damage!
              <br/>
              You did the right thing by changing your passwords and doing a full system scan. Im not trying to promote our own product, but it wouldnt hurt to also scan for malware using Malwarebytes (and its free!).
              <br/>
              Theres one other thing you should check. The remote login programs (Teamviewer, Logmein, etc) have the ability to auto-start when you reboot your computer and since the miscreants already granted themselves access, they could in theory retake control of your PC.
              <br/>
              Its easy to spot as you will see (or not) the remote program pop back in when you restart Windows. You could also check the startup entries using a program like this:
              <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/startuplite/" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.malwarebytes.org/startuplite/
              </a>
              to make sure it is not in there.
             </p>
             <p>
              One last thing: would you happen to remember the name of the company, phone number or their website?
             </p>
             <p>
              Hope this helps. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate!
             </p>

              Hi
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks Jerome.  Full system scan came up ok and after running malabytes (both products) seems ok.  Only relief is I did not give them my bank details and do not use my laptop for day to day email, surfing or banking however can see how easy it would be to be sucked in.
             </p>
             <p>
              Number came up as international (no number), the speaker had a Indian accent, and they said they were from Microsoft security centre.  I deal a lot with Asian call centres for work so this probably gave me a false sense of security in my weak moment.  The site they led me to begin with was
              <a href="http://www.safeme.us" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.safeme.us
              </a>
              , however I believe this is a probably a normal tool to grant access? The .exe file was ammy1.exe I think .  I never got to the payment stage as I yanked the cord as they were getting into my security settings (assumably to lock me out  or grant access for later)?
             </p>
             <p>
              In total paranoia I have also turned off remote assistance  will turn it back on if ever needed for legitimate means!  I am not saying I am the brightest person out of the box however it does concern me that if it takes me a weak moment then what happens to the less suspicious.  Lets hope this is a lesson learnt by the inconvenience of time spent changing everything and nothing further!

              I checked the site (safeme.us) and saw it offers those 2 downloads (the remote software I assume). The site is registered to Jai Singh, Kolkata India. If I find other connections to an actual company name, Ill let you know.

              Heres a new number for you to play with91-336-460-1150. Indian accent same story. Stated he was calling from Wintech in California. I havent checked to see if thats a real companysomehow I doubt it!
             </p>
             <p>
              I didnt play mores the pity. If they call again Ill have some fun with them. Interestingly enough the country code for India is 91. I dont think  anyone said there was a country code on their caller ID. Interestingly enough the area code 336 is in North Carolina and thats the state I live in.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please dont give personal information to anyone that you having called yourself!!!!

              Hi, guys, If you install WOT (web of trust) add on you can rate website and leave comments on them. Right now I am adding most of the sites listed above a scam related. Another good one is webutations.net or avast has one when you install it.

              Just received another one of these calls this morning and am still p*d off. Normally,  I play along and try to learn as much as I can or to have some fun, but couldnt be bothered today. He started off with the Indian accent and Microsoft security.bla ba  before I hung up on him with a few choice words.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I found interesting here was that this time the phone number was blocked and that they asked for me by NAME. They are obviously improving their game.
             </p>
             <p>
              Curiously, I also received an unsolicited skype message from a very old Skype contact (now blocked) early this morning that went like this:
             </p>
             <p>

              Of course the best defense is to spread the word, and I am glad to hear that some of these turkeys are finally getting frustrated at not being able to find new victims.
              <br/>
              Also a good idea to start encrypting your personal email, try out Virtru for that.

              I had a similar yet unique experience about a year ago. My Epson Printer was malfunctioning, so I did an internet search for Epson. I found a link to what appeared to be an Epson site, with a number to call. I called it, and they were quick to offer help I just need to remote in they told me and, like your experience, I had to download a program to allow them to take the steering wheel. I foolishly proceeded, thinking I had a legit person at the other end who was helping me. Immediately after they had access, without ever opening any of my Epson or Printer settings, the lady on the phone said I see the problem as I watched her go straight to my firewall icon. I immediately caught on that she was about to disable my firewall so she could either do evil things, search for finance info, or install her own program that would give her a way to monitor activity on my computer. I quickly shut the computer off, disabled my internet service, and accused her of being a fraud. Of couse she denied the accusation, with an oh no, Ive been caught tone. Lesson learned; no legitimate hardware or software company will ask for access to your PC  never allow someone to remote into your computer unless you actually know them or have a legitimate contract with them.

              I had the same call today (02/16/14).  Too bad they called a IT/IS Consultant who uses TeamViewer on  regular basis.  I tried to wait until they provided the remote host machines IP, or TeamViewer ID, but like you stated, it went to PayPal and garbage.  I never provided them remote access to my linux machine running Wine, because I didnt have a VM handy at the time of the call.  I did however tell the guy, Youre out of your ****** tits.  Which he made me state twice, and then clearly responded with a, Yes, okay, press Windows key and R. which a got a little chuckle out of me.  Indians, God do I hate that accent.

              I received a call on 2/12/14.  I had a problem with my computer that morning so I thought the call was for real.  He said they had received a report from my computer that it was not functioning properly.  Not be very computer literate I allowed them remote access.  They asked for payment through Liz Web Solutions web site.  When they wanted my credit card # I refused and he told me if I didnt pay I wouldnt have a computer anymore.  I told him, ok I wont have a computer.  He proceeded to change the password on my computer.  He then hung up.  My computer wont boot up properly and when the password screen came up nothing worked.  I reset my computer to the factory defaults and got up and running again.  He did indicate to me that he could access the other computers in my home since they run off the same modem and he had my IP address.  Is this true?

              Hi Cynthia Gibson,
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry to hear about what happened but thankfully you made the right choice by refusing to pay.
              <br/>
              They were only able to remotely connect using Teamviewer or Logmein on that particular machine (with your help). What they told you about accessing any other computer on your network is a lie they used to scare you into believing them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I see many other complaints about Liz web solutions so it looks like they have been at it for some time now. Will investigate it.

              I got the same call today and asked the scammer if he could just wait until I was done masturbating to the **** I was watching.  He actually said yes, I can wait,  I said more off the wall things to him and no matter what, he was willing to wait.  Unbelievable!

              I received a call from a client on Wednesday (19 Feb 14) that had d/l-d and activated teamviewer and was about to enter credit card information. I told him to not pay and have these Windows support guys call him back in one hour. Dashed over and shutdown, boot SafeMode, malwarebytes,  all looked okay.
             </p>
             <p>
              * Scammer did as described above: Have user look at Event Viewer, Config Utility, other files.
             </p>
             <p>
              Two points: (1) Client was impressed by their website, quickcompsupport.com and he even pointed to a GoDaddy.com Certified emblem, which was merely a button that popped up with registrar info.
              <b>
               These guys are registered with GoDaddy
              </b>
              which makes me wonder what responsibility registrars have in cases like these.
             </p>
             <p>
              (2) I think my call back in one hour got them off the case without them vandalizing my clients laptop  but you can never be sure. If I had a wired ethernet connection, Id have that pulled, but if its WiFi, the laptop can reconnect automatically, meaning the teamviewer access could be resumed. The next time a client calls with a case like that, Im going to ask them to do a
              <b>
               Start  Hibernate
              </b>
              which should freeze everything and give me full control when I get over to examine the unit.

              I was at a friends house this morning helping him remove malware on his machine when we recieved a call from these scammers. We quickly grew suspicious and ended the call.
             </p>
             <p>
              We hopefully cleaned out the malware (incidentally, one of the steps was rebooting in Safe mode which did finally allow us internet access via IE after which we installed malwarebytes and ran a complete scan  so thanks to your company for that software).
             </p>
             <p>
              I find the fact that the scammers called while we were troubleshooting the infection too much to be coincidence but my friend insists he hasnt given out his phone number previously to anyone.
             </p>
             <p>
              Has there been reports of similar incidents?  I suppose his phone number could have been transmitted via the malware infection but I never heard of this before,

              A place called cyber support from their NYC Headquarters called me today and said my computer was loaded with viruses and malware. They said they were receiving issues from my internet. Took me to the pages and said look at all the errors and warnings, which I only had a few normal ones. Then asked me to open the run box and type
              <a href="http://www.rescue1.jimdo.com" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.rescue1.jimdo.com
              </a>
              so his techs could help me with my computer which I did not do. The call came from a 201 area code. Be careful everyone.

              The website mentioned above (safeme.us) still exists. They are, perhaps, trying to mimic safeme.co.uk, an online storage website.

              We get these types of calls every so often. Ive tried to warn all my friends to hang up on these guys.

              I have been experiencing this scam outfit for 2 years now.  The first time they called, like a real dummy I fell for it. When I told my computer literate son he told me to quickly change my credit card number and my email address. I did both of these things, but unfortunately still had to pay $175.00. Had to pay $100.00 to a tech to wipe my computer. Didnt hear from them for over a year and then the phone calls started again. So far, they have had 3 scams prepared for me. The first was the virus on the computer scam. Second was they were shutting down their company therefore would like to reimburse me $185.00. I told them wonderful send it on. Then it started, I had to go on my computer to fill out a form and then they would be able to reimburse me. I told them they could send it to me by email and got the no,no you must go on your computer. When I told them there was no way they were getting me on my computer they hung up. Now just last night I received 7 phone calls from them The angle this time was that my Microsoft updates were in danger. I told them to leave me alone, but they just kept calling. When my husband got on the phone to them and told them we wouldnt go on our computer he told us that at midnight they would be shutting all the Microsoft updates down. My husband told them go ahead, I dont care, the man swore and then hung up. Of course at midnight nothing happened. We are on the west coast of Canada and I have several area codes to list for you.to watch out for 817 (Ft. Worth Tx) 718 (Brooklyn, NY) 607 (Binghampton NY) 310 (Los Angeles CA) 585 (Rochester NY) 512 (Austin, Tx) 514 Roxboro (QC) and the latest 315 (Syracuse, NY). I realize of course that these people are not calling from these areas but it might help others..

Indian accent claiming to be from Microsoft  virus on my computer etc. When he directed me to turn on my computer etc. I played along for a little while and then hung up on him. He immediately called me back and asked why I had hung up on him  I told him I knew it was a scam (since I had almost fallen for it a few months earlier) and that I didnt even have the patience to  mess with him zny longer- then he hung up on me.!

              <br/>
              she tried to convince me that my current antivirus was not compatible with windows 7 professional. and had me navigate to the program compatibility settings, she claimed that it says windows xp sp3.. so it wouldnt work with win7.
              <br/>
              she had me use a program called. ammyy to access my desktop. its like teamviewer.  she opened notepad and typed in some information, company name, contact number..   so i opened my smart phone. typed in the phone number and it let me to this webpage..   so i opened the webpage on my computer and told here that aparently some people think the company is a scam.. she hung up on me.. i closed ammyy.. but it actually didnt go away. i had to kill it with task manager,  each time i would end it, it would reopen. i had to end it, and delete the program at the same time to make it stop.    anyways. this is the info she typed in notepad for me.  remove all the hackers from computer..

              First, youve got to be REALLY, REALLY, REALLY gullible to give these people access to your computer.  A windows tech, a real one, would send you an e-mail, wouldnt he/she??  How would they have your telephone number or even your name??
              <br/>
              I started getting calls from India about my computer. I made an Indian cry, he actually started bawling.   He couldnt imagine there was someone so evil in this world after I told him what Id do to him and his family if I ever got the chance.  They never called back.
              <br/>
              Just as they are in India, so the do not call list means nothing to them, so to are they not under the umbrella of US law.  Say what you will to them, hear them cry.

              I just got the same type of phone call (heavy Indian accent male), stating he was a Microsoft Certified Tech, and my computer was sending error message repeatedly (to where? I have no idea).  First, MS does not call you like that.  I actually work there as a consultant, so I knew this was fishy from the start.  He showed me the event log, showing bunch of error/warning list trying to make me think my computer has a major issue.  He tried to make me delete these log by pressing the delete button. When I reported nothing happens, he was like oh my gosh, that is a major problem if you cant delete these log!  Let me help you on this remotely.  He made me open

              </a>
              website, and told me to download a software (so he can remote access my machine).  That is as far as I was comfortable leading him on. I told him I was not comfortable downloading any unknown software at this time, and I much rather take my machine to a in person IT department technician.  He kept talking, trying to change my mind for a bit, but when he realized I am not budging, he handed the phone to a manager. He came on saying whats your problem? so I replied I dont even know what my problem is! And who are you guys anyway?! He insisted he was a Microsoft Certified Tech again, and tried to go down the same path as the last guy,  so I just said if I have any issue with my machine, I will just take it to a Microsoft IT guy in person tomorrow and have him look at it. At that point, he gave up and mumble something and hang up on me!
              <br/>
              Be careful, Microsoft NEVER calls people at home unless you initiate the contact first, and certainly wont call at 10:30pm at night!

              I just got a call from Hello this is technical support about your computer not 5 minutes ago.  The accent sounded like it was from India.  The moment he said that I told him I. Dont. Need. Technical support.  I must have sounded extremely suspicious (I am a tech support guy myself, so a random call from a blocked number offering to support my computer had my hackles up) because he replied, I am not trying to support you, I am just asking you to update your computer and he hung up before I could go all Sherlock Holmes and find out what was going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thats when I did a web-search and found this.
             </p>
             <p>
              So they have changed their MO a little bit; the call came from a blocked number, and they never claimed to be from Microsoft; but it is still happening, so be on guard!

              I just got the following call Hello this is Steve from Microsoft Technical Support, I just wish to inform you that we are constantly receiving messages from your computer. This means that your computer has a malware sending private data outside. Thus it is very important to clean your computer. I will give you a web site address that will check your CLSID, etc
              <br/>
              The guy had a strong Indian or Pakistani accent. I stopped the conversion telling him that was just  leaving for doing my jogging. By the meantime he insisted several time that I should go in front of my computer.
              <br/>
              I suspect them to search phone numbers by name (Dauphin in my case) as when I was in my father home (who is 96 years old), he received the same phone call that I answered for him.

              Thank you so much for this blog. I just had the same scammers call me today. I had just purchased a new laptop about a month ago, but noticed some oddities with the system, so when the Indian person claiming to be from Microsoft called saying that they were receiving lots of error messages from my computer I thought they must actually be paying attention finally as every other error message report I had sent had received no answer. Anyhow. after the first guy walked me through showing me how many error messages I had he transferred me to his supervisor who also sounded Indian. He asked me how many error messages I had and sounded incredulous when I told him I had 27,472. He then asked me to get on the web and go to mspccare.com. I then informed him that I didnt have internet access at my house and only used public wifi. He didnt seem to get that concept, and finally accepted that I could not get onto the internet by hanging up the phone on me.

              I received one of these calls the other day.  Like a lot of you, Im also an IT professional.  This was a very similar script to what Jean-Claude Dauphin (above) encountered.  I told the guy that I didnt need his help, and he was very insistent.  I then told him that I was using a corporate laptop, and if there was any problem, Id take it to the corporate infrastructure guys.  And that furthermore, only an idiot would let some unknown, unsolicited person remote into his machine in this day and age.  Then I hung up.
             </p>
             <p>
              The brazenness and longevity of this scam is amazing.  Somebody like my (late) elderly father would have fallen for it.

              I received a call from this woman with a very heavy Indian accent on Friday March 21, 2014 telling me that she was from the Windows 7 IT Department and if I did not stop what I was doing she was going to seize my computer and have me arrested.
              <br/>
              I told her that I didnt know what she was talking about and hung up. Today, Monday March 24, 2014 I received a call from the same # 210-280-8487. This call was from a man with a heavy Indian accent and he told me the same thingwindows 7 IT Department and that what I was doing with my computer was illegal and if I didnt stop it they will seize my computer and have me arrested. I told him that my computer must have a virus on it since I was not doing anything with it. He went on to say that my computer was sending out viruss and I had to make it stop and he would help me do this by following his direction. At that point I put him on hold and googled Windows 7 IT Department and phone scams came up. I quickly hung up on him. After reading all of the posts attached to this blog I think they are getting more persistent and using stronger languagecomputer seized &amp; having you arrested to get you to give them money. I have been spreading the word to all of my family and friends to be on the look out. I guess thats all we can do at this point unless some one has a better idea, just let me know. Thanks

             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for sharing this experience here. Their scare tactics are going really far, very much like ransomware in fact.

              Spreading the word is one thing indeed, but also documenting who they are (company name, website, etc). I invite you to check out this resource page for more info:

              Just got off the phone with the same scammers.  It was funny, when they had me enter Eventvwr, the Event Viewer screen didnt pop up as shown above, but a box that had two options, one to send the error report to Microsoft and some other option.  I read both to her, she obviously had never heard this before (and wasnt on her step-by-step checklist,,lol!), so she hung up.  She called back, saying that we got disconnected.  Her next ploy was to ask to take over my computer.  I said, how stupid do you think that I am and slammed the phone down.  I do recall getting a similar phone call a week or so ago, but I hung up on that thick-accented person since I couldnt understand a word he was saying except computer.  They are calling from 1-213-337-0014 MCI ITSS Telesy out of Los Angeles, CA according to my phone logs from Comcast.

              How much fun it is to play with the scammers.  I have cracked one as he was from Bangladesh and he aid he needed the job.  I wished him well, but assured him he was working in an illegal operation.  I felt sorry for this one, the others  so many no I dont feel sorry for them.  When they call me there is a time gap on the line which is a give away.  Now for the serious part.  There is a part 2 of this scam.  The call comes from Western Union, or Microsoft  I have had both,  They know I have paid a scammer and they are reimbursing my money as they are companies of good faith  actual quote  I just have to give them my bank details to allow them to deposit the money into my bank account.  I could not remember paying the money, perhaps it was my husband who is away at the moment, how much was it?  $500, or $299 depending upon the caller.  I asked them to reverse my credit card  oh no they could not do that, this is the process their account section created.  Then I told them you know, its only $x, they can keep it  both times they went into paroxyms of shock.  Then I hung up and I reported it to the scam watch in my state.  There had been anther scam related to Australias Telstra company claiming that my internet account will be cut off as they have detected a virus being generated from my computer.  I told them they need to go through my internet supplier as that is the chain of command and then reported them to my scam watch.

              Heh!  Just got off the phone with a similar clown.  Someone with a thick Indian accent trying to get me to go to my computer so he could help me clean it.  I asked him for the name of his company and its tel. no.  he gave me a no. 201-132-4620 (that doesnt exist  I checked) and said his company was called Cyber Support.  I asked to speak to his supervisor and he countered that he WAS the supervisor.  Anyway, I am originally from India myself so I decided to play along.  After about 5 minutes of pointless leg-pulling he finally gave up and asked if I was Indian (he had my name and it was pretty obvious I was Indian).  At that point he asked me if I spoke Hindi  I told him I didnt.  He then accused me of not being Indian because I didnt know my mother language.  I tried to tell him that my mother didnt speak Hindi either and we got into this extended discussion about the difference between a government designated national language and the phrase mother tongue and me quizzing him on other Indian languages  it was bizarre!  Anyway, after a few more minutes he just got tired of the conversation and hung up the phone.
              <br/>
              My approach with scammers is to try and get their identity if possible (usually its not) and if that fails, and as long as I have some free time, its a great way to have some fun

              They called me from Microsoft today with the heavy Indian accent telling me my computer had problems (yes, sure!) and I told them I had a Mac.  They called a few hours later.  Persistent.  I hung up.

              HAHAHAHA oh these guys are great. Just got off the phone with one of them. I dont have the patience to play their game, they always seem to call when Im running out the door to pick kids up from school. So I ask them one simple question What is my Windows 8 License number? They always say Yes I can provide that for you, one moment and then they hang up. One of these days I hope theyll call earlier in the day so I can string them along for a while.

              I just hung up from the caller.  He told me to hang up.  He gave up on me.  I strung him along for about 10 minutes.  I dont even have a windows computer.  I only have Mac.  He kept asking me what I saw on my screen and I kept asking him what should I see?  What am I looking for?  What should I see?  Then I would repeat what he said to me.  I wasnt even logged on.

              Kept one going for twenty minutes today. The incoming caller id was 999911110 (bogus, not even ten digits), and when I queried him about that he said he was calling using the Internet. I told him that I would have to call him back because my phone isnt next to my computer, so he said I could call him back at 8884153266, which is just another bogus number, but Im including it here, so that a Google search would lead the next person to this page. I asked him several times what company he worked for and he claimed it was Windows Security Center  when I asked whether this was Microsoft, though, he denied that and said it was affiliated with Microsoft. Dont you know Windows?  I answered Of course I know Windows, I have Windows all around my house. I claimed to have several computers, could he tell me which computer it was, but he just said Its your Windows computer  but which one  he said serial number . hesitating  then made up some numbers, including some dots, but if it was an IP address, it was just like the IP addresses I see on CSI, with numbers greater than 255. I said I didnt recognize that number.
             </p>
             <p>
              He then seemed forget that I told him I couldnt reach the computer and I pretended to be ready to type on my Windows machine. He skipped over the Eventvwr scam and went straight for TeamViewer, verified that I saw a picture of a pretty lady holding a box, and then wanted me to download the software and run it, where it would show a login box for which he wanted me to tell him the identifying number and password. When I hemmed and hawwed a while over giving that to him, he just dropped the call. Teamviewer wasnt going to run very well on my Linux system. Ill have to set up a Virtual Windows Box for him to hack on the next time he calls.
             </p>
             <p>
              To me it was an obvious scam, its hard to imaging that people really fall for this. But conversely, I thought I was doing a terrible job leading him on, and he kept going well past where I thought hed catch on that I was as full of s#1t as he was.

              Hi Emily Jones,
             </p>
             <p>
              Thats a good way to take them off guard, asking for your Windows license number!
              <br/>
              Once I asked them where they were located: California. Then I asked them what time it was. After a good 20 seconds and keyboard typing in the background, they came back and said: 2 PM. Thank you Google

              These people called me this morning.  I was in just such a mood so I started interrogating this Indian guy named Sean who was supposed to be in Washington based upon the phone number.  Working a lot with really nice folks from India, I asked him he was in Chennai, Hyderabad or Bangalore since I had friends there and I wanted to know what the weather was like. He slipped up and said no, he was in Eastern India which probably means Mumbai. Then I did described my list visit to India, how impressive I found the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort and Mumbai, and the place where people would bathe in Ganges River and how embarrassed I was that I couldnt remember what the place was called.  I asked if his province had voted in the elections yet and that it was very interesting because it is the largest election in the world.  Then I was back to asking him if he really from Microsoft because I was under the impression they never did anything for free, and he kept saying no, he was from the Microsoft Help Desk, and I said Microsoft never does anything for free and this went on for a while. He was quite adamant I not have the computer connected to the Internet (probably so I couldnt google them). Then he transferred me to his supervisor named Mike who again said he was from the Microsoft Help Desk and it was their noble mission in life was to help all the Microsoft users with all these problems which will cause their computers to stop working. I said Microsoft never does anything for free and was he sure had anything to do with Microsoft. Or maybe did he have something to do with Norton, McAfee or Malawarebytes?   I could tell he was getting a little cranky.  So I did the whole travelog one more time.   Since I was having fun told him okay lets try to fix my problem because if it didnt work I could complain to his bosses at Microsoft.   He then said I needed to do the whole win(r) thing.  Then I asked him which computer he thought I had the problem with because we have a Lenovo, a Toshiba, 3 HPs, a Gateway and a Fujitsu plus a Dell for work and he needed to specify which one had the issue so that he could fix the right one. I then said he must be a good person because he was trying so hard to help me out (lol), and since it was Good Friday and if he cheated me hed probably go to ****. He hung up.

              I got a call today, very similar to your story. Said he was from Windows, which from the start I had a feeling was BS for a few reasons 1: I highly doubt Microsoft would actively call its clients to help them with these kind of issues. 2. How would the get my number. 3. Most people say they world work for a company, For example: I am calling from Microsoft in the Windows Support Department. So, like you, I decided to play along to see what they had in store. I honestly believed them for a few minutes but then the weird stuff they were telling me to enter in the Run Windows inf virus by hackers or prefetch virus I knew it was complete BS. Then comes the command line tricks, changing the background quickly without me seeing to red so I think something bad is going on. such a scam. I have multiple screens so I pulled the event logger for team viewer up on the other screen and he was like look at this file and I was like you just put it there, the event log says you just wrote a file. He was like no. And he even proceeded to show me how he contacting my computer through some computer identification number. And yea I hung up and changed my team viewer password.

              I have already spoke to the police department and the Attorney General office office and also spoke with the federal Trade Commission commis in regards to the Microsoft windows tech support fraud I have been happening since last year, there is not much that they can do other than blocking the phone numbers and reporting them they are working to try to resolve the issues.
              <br/>
              saw those last time when they call I had went out and got my air horn from my boat and I had asked to speak to their supervisor Neil and he was put on the line and I let him have it.. I also gave a few good words and told them if I could ever track them down that I would personally find him and take revenge for all the people that they have ripped off before contacting the police!
              <br/>
              so I probably will not be hearing from them again!
              <br/>
              the phone number that they called from is a Philidephia Pennsylvania area and they said they were calling from Los Angeles CA.
             </p>
             <p>
              So if you have an wait horn ask for supervisor Neil and let him have it!!!
             </p>

              I had a sense of it being off. Whenever we get viruses, its not like our internet provider will call us to alert us.

              Scammers # is -299-888-7652.  They hate getting callbacks that waste their time.  Im convinced its not several large organizations but many smaller ones.  If you get calls ( I have gotten hundreds over the last 3 months alone) The only thing they react to is calling them back and telling them you got a call to your phone from this # and you didnt know what it was.  When they start their thing by telling you to boot up the computer ask them to wait and just put the phone down.  Calling back several times in a row and laughing at them really angers them.  Of course never give them access to your comp.  It keeps their phone lines jammed and I get the same few guys every time I call.  They laughed at me when I asked them to lose my number but that stopped and eventually they will shut the phones off.  If you get a call save the number under scam and call them and waste their time when you can.  I call at all hours when I can because they are going to call me.  If you recognize the # i left welcome.  I think its a few guys in their basement and they hate the tables being turned. 888-299-7652. Ask for any name hell be there.  Please lets all tell everyone and try calling them for a change you will love the reactions.

              Is this a scam?  Got a call from Daniel Brown, heavy Indian accent, terrible connection.  Cellphone Caller ID has #706-550-6147 which reverse lookup says is located in Augusta, Georgia.  He says someone has my email address (which he had my correct address) and is spamming other people.  He had me look in my emailbox and then we pulled up the event viewer as described above and had me pull up the errors.  Then he had me go to Logmein, and I balked before the actual download, said I had to check with my internet provider and took a callback number from him.  I called my provider.  They had me run some test emails to myself, which worked, and couldnt find his company in the 800 numbers list they had.  He claimed to be with a company called Premier Technical Support, phone number 800-373-8706, which I was unable to find on reverse lookup.  In short, I called the 800 number and another Indian voice answered, and I hung up. Called back the 760 number and Daniel answered, but I think I messed up because I called on my home phone and he immediately called me back, Caller ID 365 GEEK REPAIR, but I didnt answer, so now he has my home phone # as well.  He didnt actually get access to my computer, but I am unnerved.  He had my cellphone # and my correct email address, and he didnt get around to asking for money, but the warning on Logmeins download page scared me enough to get off the phone with him.  I guess what he was after was access to my banking passwords, etc.  Oh, and I also found a website for a company called Premium Technical Support out of California, and tried to contact them via phone and email, and neither worked.  Scam, or what do you think?
              <br/>
              Thanks

              Same thing happened to me today.  They said my Windows machine was infected with a virus.  I told them I was running Linux but it didnt faze themthey said I just had to be running Windows.  I explained to them, no I wasnt but it was like talking to a brick wall.  I hung up on them and they proceeded to call back about 5 times from the following number: 700-107-7398

              these Windows people called me today and I almost fell for it. I let them take me to my event viewer and got me freaking out about all of the warnings. She also had me run cmd on my computer and I let her verify my windows license #. Im scared she can hack in now? I didnt give them the license # but they somehow knew it and I verified it as correct. I googled this while on the phone with her and figured it was a scam. My phone died as she passed me to her supervisor. She called back 10 times and I told her I knew it was a scam and I was going to contact the FBI. She quickly hung up and hasnt called back once.

              I just got the exact same call.  Female caller, heavy Indian accent, no name or employee number (boy, am I dumb  should have figured it was a scam a lot sooner) from my vendor technical support  She had me open the eventvwr, but skipped the second step in the article and went on to msconfig.  Maybe her copy of the script had a few pages deleted?  We didnt get to the remote software download part.  Same scare tactics with the errors and warning messages indicating that my software was infected and corrupted and would crash my computer very soon.  Finally suspicious, I asked for proof she was getting technical information from my computer  like, what was the manufacturer  she said it didnt matter  I said yes it does  any computer has those warnings.  I hung up.  I wish Id been smarter sooner, but at least I didnt download anything.  No cursing or anything, at least.  This is the first call Ive gotten, hopefully I wont get the repeated ones other people are describing.  But then again, I usually hang up when I hear the silent moment as a robocall is transferred to a human.

              Thanks.  Got one of these calls and played for awhile.  Are you in front of your computer?  Is your keyboard turned on?, etc.  Locate the Windows key and press it.  I told her nothing happens.  She had me do some troubleshooting and repeats.  After some timewasting, I told her I was running Linux.  Call dropped!  So I dont  know where she got the errors from.

              I was on the phone for about 10 minutes and the guy seemed to believe he was doing an honest job.   I have a feeling at least some of their 1st line guys dont actually know they are part of a sam.

             <p>
              I got the one I was taking to type in windows repair scam on google and I got him to go your web site.    He seemed to be honestly suprised at what he was reading.    I dont know if one could successfully slow this scam down by having enough people take this tact and cause them to lose their first phone answers faster than they can replace them.     There is a chance that eventually this will result in them only having hard core scammers calling, but that might also limit their labor force and slow things door.

              I thought I was with Avast tech support which was outsourced to India because of the name and accent.  Nice enough guy who said he played some of the same games he saw on my computer.    Then he changed the subject and told me I had some 49,000 problems on my PC that needed repaired and had to ask if I had the free or subscription Avast.and since I had free Avast I needed to pay 299 USD.

              I only got rid of him by saying I was a retiree on a pension and could not afford him.
              <br/>
              he was polite enough but deleted all the solutions to my so called problems before signing off and leaving.

              HAHA  great article  I actually received one of these telephone calls in SWEDEN! And yes their was a heavy accent from the woman on the other end, however, my landline phone they called did give me enough information to see that the call originated from England  so I am going to assume the accent is a Pakistani Urdu accent because there are 2 to 3 million people of Pakistani origin in England.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first thing I believe people should ask (themselves) is how MICROSOFT would know YOUR computer is infected, and how they determined the phone number of a computer user ??  IMPOSSIBLE.  In my home there are 4 PCs and 3 laptops and the internet provider information is connected to one of 5 cell phones in this household NOT the landline.  Either way, nobody is going to call you and even KNOW you have a computer unless they are from your Internet Provider.
             </p>
             <p>
              And regardless of any of that for someone to call and say I am from Microsoft and your computer is infected is one of the most absolutely harebrained things someone could believe!  HOW? How would they even know who you are?  WHY? Why would they call you even if they did?
             </p>
             <p>
              There are a BILLION computers worldwide using Microsoft windows  does anyone honestly believe they monitor computers for viruses and then call people to help them?   It would cost billions of dollars and even if they could why should they?  The sooner your computer breaks the sooner they can sell you a new one!
             </p>
             <p>
              I pretended to be stupid, and stalled her by saying I could not understand her accent  I asked her where she was calling from again?  I then asked her why someone in England who barely speaks English anyway would be chosen to contact users in SWEDEN  didnt they have anyone who spoke Swedish?  I then asked her numerous questions, who exactly was she trying to contact here at this number, which computer exactly was infected  after all we have 9.  Continuing I asked her to explain how they determined our computer was infected and how they knew who to contact by phone to tell them.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the end I finally just asked her how stupid do you think I am? Theres no way you would know who to call, you dont even know my name and this is a B***S*** scam you stupid B**ch and hung up on her.  HAHA  loved getting in the last word and loved how confused she got about all my questions.  Her answers were ridiculous and clear evidence she had no idea what she was talking about and was too stupid to be a computer technician in real life, instead of a thief and a criminal  which is what she really is.   Half the answers didnt even make sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              GOOD JOB telling people about this scam.  I guess I can understand how FEAR is a great motivator to get people to believe a phone call in which the person neither gives you their name, title, phone number nor location while trying to convince you they are a legitimate Microsoft Service Technician and trying to get you to allow access to your computer.  I figured after they got access they would just phish all your personal data and suck the money out of your account  but getting people to freely pay 300bucks sounds much easier.

              got the call from them yesterday July 16th.  Said he was Microsoft Tech Support. When the accented male east indian voice got to the your computer is infected part, I broke in to his thread and just said it was a fraudulent call because my home computer isnt connected to the internet.  He warned me that he was going to call me each and every day  I am tempted to reconnect my computer and let him access my virtual machine but after reading all the above, it would be a waste of everyones time.

              I have received a number of these calls in the last while. While at the cottage in Quebec which does not have internet, got  a few. They wouldnt accept that no computer and no internet there. Then I asked if they spoke French  guy tells me he is native English speaker. I told him that he sounded like a Hindi and no way was native English. . Well this got a reaction  seems he is calling from Pakistan  so now he was advised he was a Paki with a rag top. Then he starts swearing big time. Got another one today at home and told him didnt have Microsoft computer, then he suggested MAC which I said no, Wanted to know what I had so said Linex so ended the call.

              Hi, I realize this blog is from last year but I was just scammed last night (7/18/14.) However,  it wasnt a telephone call, it was a, Windows Firewall Warning, ad that popped up on my computer.  I called the phone number listed on the pop. The lady gained access to my computer from,  Log MeIn.Com. She proceeded to show me all the windows and warnings they mentioned to you. And I really thought they were all threats. She even showed me the, Running, and,  Stopped,  programs. She did I needed to have their online tech clean my laptop. But,  I refused and she got mad. She kept dropping the price and proceeded to tell me i had to get it done now because by tomorrow my computer will have 10x the amount of viruses and problems.  I refused to give her my credit card info and hung up on her.  She has my phone number- she repeated it to me at the beginning of the call and at one point she did her phone was cutting out and it did in us and she called me back. But,  when I hung up on her after refusing to give my credit info she didnt even try to call me back.  My question is: since she had access to my computer- does she still have access now? When I used the LogMeIn, I ran the system- I did not install it. And she supposedly used, SUPER ANTI SPYWARE,  to scan my computer for viruses. When I hung up on her, she quickly closed all the windows she opened and disconnect the, Logmein.  I uninstalled the Super anti spyware, after I hung up on her, disconnected my laptop from the wifi and closed all my bank cards, credit cards and changed my passwords to email,  Paypal, ebay (I did online banking and shopping on that laptop.) Do you think they still have access to my laptop? To mt desktop that is connected to the same router? Do you think they could gain access of my web history and obtain mt passwords, banking info, or personal information Ive entered before on my laptop?
             </p>
             <p>
              Im sorry to bombard you with so many questions.  Youre the only one who I see is interacting with others and actually giving feedback. Thanks so much.
             </p>
             <p>
              The phone number I called is: (855) 548-3388
             </p>
             <p>
              And the phone number she called me back on was: (800) 449-7728

              I just received a call from a Indian guy. Telling me the same story as above. I asked if he was a scam. (Like to see if they lie or such) He said no he is from Microsoft. Said I have errors etc. Something in my gut was telling me NO!. I asked him where he got my phone number from. And replied with you are registered with us. (I dont think so sunshine.) Anyway I said Could I check it out first before carrying on. He was polite to give me his number (13217635857) I said I would call him back if  I found him to be true. I have caller ID and the number was different (08845122).
              <br/>
              I dont have money in my bank as I am on sick. When I typed in the number on google (My best friend). It came up with this link. After watching this I feel so lucky I didnt give him any details. Sorry you got hit and others like this. I am waiting for a call back to which wil get them no where. No details were given so hopefully they can not get into my computer. Is there something we can do about these people? I mean It can not go on its disgusting the way these people con money out of us. So need to return the favor back to them. ~So would love to do it to them the hackers~.  Thank you for this information. I will share this on FB. So no others will get taken for a ride.

              We recently got a phone call like this at my parents house.  They dont own a computer, dont have their TV connected online, still use a landline phone, they have very little technology outside of indoor plumbing and electricity.    Mom answered the phone, the second they said computer she said Oh I dont use computers but my daughter does and she handed me the phone.  They went through the same spiel.  When they asked me to turn on the computer, I asked Where do I find that? Find what? The computer.  Where do I find it?  Are you sending us one?  Is it coming UPS?  No, I need you to turn on your computer so we can send the update.   We ran around like this for at least ten minutes before they gave up with cursing and threats that your computer wont work tomorrow.

              Hi vwisnewski,
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for your comment and providing so much information (will be useful for us to check on).
              <br/>
              From the sounds of it, the technician attempted the pitch but wasnt able to convince you to hand over your financial information. My feeling is that they probably gave up on you and moved on to someone else.
             </p>
             <p>
              You already seem to have done a lot of precautionary steps in case they snooped around your machine (something that they could do). Sometimes the remote program (i.e. logmein) can be restarted on reboot to allow the technician to take control again. Just to be sure, please do a search on your computer for logmein. If there are any traces, please remove them.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can also run a full scan on your computer for possible malware (feel free to use our Malwarebytes software).
             </p>
             <p>
              Other than that, it seems like it was a really bad experience and scary indeed but hopefully no real long term harm.

              Same issue as vwisnewski happened to my wife this afternoon. The phone number brought her to an individual who claims that above a certain number of virus detections, Microsoft directs you to a Microsoft technician. Same deal  used TeamViewer for access and for the small fee of $299.99, removed adware, etc. I assume this isnt a legitimate Microsoft practice, but how can I verify? The website the technician directed me to (onvoicesupport.com) looks like a one-man show and debit was listed as Deep Infotech LLC.

              Hi layankee,
             </p>
             <p>
              Im sorry to hear that
              <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="https://blog.malwarebytes.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>
             </p>
             <p>
              A quick look at the site you listed shows very suspicious registrant information:
              <br/>
              Privacy Protection Service INC
              <br/>
              British Virgin Islands  Road Town  Pdr Ltd.
             </p>
             <p>
              Microsoft would never call you directly. Heres their official statement: You will never receive a legitimate call from Microsoft or our partners to charge you for computer fixes. from
              <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/avoid-phone-scams.aspx" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/avoid-phone-scams.aspx
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              If there is any way for you to reverse the charges, please give it a try. You will want to talk to your bank and keep a close eye on your account to make sure additional charges are not made.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, if the same people call back again you should not answer as they could potentially do more damage.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you for sharing the name of the company. This will help us to add them to our list of scammers so that other people are aware.

              Ive had several calls from these dolts. I often say that Ive got more than one PC and they would need to let me have the IP address of the one in question to enable me to identify the one they mean. Much as they try to get around it by sweet talking me, they cant provide the address, so it all ends in tears for them. Ive also told them that my PC runs on Linux, which ends the conversation quickly!
             </p>
             <p>
              The Mac ploy also works, as already mentioned. On one occasion, I only spoke in French, too! The games we play, eh?

              Thank you Mr Segura for this blog. It is very helpful indeed. I received a call from Steve at Windows Service Centre from a withheld number. I told him I can sort out any problem with my computer on my own; to which he replied the problem is too complicated for me to deal with on my own. I told him I was the head of the MI6 Cybercrime team (which is untrue) so I know what Im doing. For some reason he became very flustered and hung up.

              By some miracle, I havent gotten one of these calls yetwhich upsets me, because I really want one. My plan: I have a Windows 7 VM waiting, with folders like tax documents and pr0n and secret files. Then, I really mess with them by sounding all excited and saying, yknow, I really HAVE been having issues! Im so glad you called! For bonus points, I have SearchProtect and the Ask Toolbar installedjust enough unwanted software to sell it. Then, when they ask for money, play dumb with lines like, but Im under warranty! or I already paid Best Buy for this service! Ill follow their instructions to the letter, having already taken a snapshot of the VM. Let them do their worst, and when they tell me to reboot, Ill revert to the perfectly functional snapshot and say, it works so much better now! Thank you so much for your help!
             </p>
             <p>
              I do hope I never ACTUALLY get a call from these crooks, but Im ready for them.

              I just got a call from DAVID with a heavy indian accent from Global IT in New Jersey.  I could hear many other foreign voices in the background, like a loud call center. DAVID could not explain how he knew I had a problem with my computer, but  not know my name. I asked him at what point in his scam he would be asking me for money, at which point he stated that nothing in life is free. I told him he was a crook and should be ashamed of trying to steal from gullible people.

              And she was pleasant while instructing me in a thick
              <br/>
              Indian accent vocie that I had a Trojan on my computer.
              <br/>
              I immediately knew this was a scam call.
              <br/>
              So my responses were going to be fun.

              <br/>

              <br/>

              on your computer (She was rambling on)

              These guys called me two times, when they called me first I knew immediately and wasnt able to do the whole remove malware thing since I only had mountain lion on virtualbox instead and I cut the guy short, then they called me again and this time I had windows 7 on virtualbox then did whatever they asked me to do. I demanded to know where he was calling from and he said he was in singapore, microsoft asia support desk then he talked for an hour instructing me to open cmd, event viewer and read what I see After waiting an hour on the phone finally the guys told me he will call me when the technician finishes his work after 30 minutes. After the technician started the work I got a little aggressive, demanding the work be done quick since I need to watch videos on youtube(we were using notepad to communicate). The technician told me to be patient again then the supervisor called me and said the technician reported that I was in a hurry and asked me what is wrong since I waited an hour. I said I need the work to be done real quick otherwise I will be closing the connection, then he asked me to use only 15 minutes and the job will be done. I disconnected teamviewer and told him that I was on virtual machine and it wasnt a real computer and I was just messing up with him wasting time. He was ****** off for real and used profanity then hung up. Had a good time.

              Got a call today from a guy with a very heavy Indian accent who said his name was Richard William &amp; that Microsoft had hired his company (PC Help Squad) to fix problems with my computer. I was suspicious but I had contacted Microsoft several months ago to resolve a problem &amp;  he insisted he wasnt selling anything &amp; that Microsoft had given him my phone number so I played along for a little while. He went straight to the msconfig spiel, which confirmed my suspicions that something was amiss since that is not an indicator of the malware he was claiming I had acquired, plus it had nothing to do with my original problem which my son told me how to fix. (Microsoft wanted $99 in spite of the fact that I was still under warranty.)  When he asked for remote access to my computer I refused until I had verified his legitimacy. He tried again to tell me that he was representing Microsoft but I told him that anyone could SAY that &amp; I would need independent confirmation. I googled PC Help Squad &amp; found that it was a scam &amp; hung up on him. He was very persistent, calling me a total of 3 times, twice from caller ID Pennsylvania 215-896-4587 &amp; once from name unknown 985-657-7574 plus, at one point he gave me a callback number 1-800-347-9066. I finally had to scream at him to stop calling me. Thank God he didnt do any damage to my computer.

              Play a mild Alzheimers patient with hearing loss with them. Have them repeat everything 3 times because you keep mishearing what they said. When you see that they are getting annoyed and ready to hang up, inquire about the status of their mothers vagina. Works every time.

              I got a call from these people last Friday. I ****** them off so bad that he actually called me back and left a VOICEMAIL threatening to end me. I wonder if the authorities would be interested in listening to it?

              Received a call today (I am in California) from an accented Indian woman claiming to be Nancy from Cybersecurity. I have been called, on average, 2 times a day over the past 10 days. Most of the time when I answer I get dead air, with a sultry female voice saying, Goodbye.
             </p>
             <p>
              She started going into the problems, and I stopped her with you are a liar and scumbag.  She asked how could I say that, and I told her again she was a liar and a scumbag. She started talking about the problems I had, and I told her the problem she had was whether her boss was going to serve the time for her and pay the penalty when she was caught. There was a silence on her end for a few seconds, and then she hung up.

              Hi, I need help. I am a gullible trusting fool who fell for this scam. It was very similar to what was described abovethey took me to showmypc.com asked for the code, loaded teamplayer, cclean and I think malwarebytes on my computercharged me 180.00s for a lifetime. I am very scared. I see these are legitimate programs. I asked showmypc.com and they told me the code only works once, so Im wondering if I delete the teamplayer and other software if they will not have access to my computer anymore? I dont know if what they did gave them access to my files and passwords? It looked like they went to the disc cleaner or defrag page and I could see  part one, part 2 and I dont know if that was cleaning something or downloading. I am really scared and I dont know what to do. Will something bad happen if I try to delete the programs&gt;?

              I received a call the other night, he had a heavy Indian accent.  I know it was a fake so I started to mess with him.  I asked him what language he was speaking, then I asked him why he had such a thick accent.  I kept going back and forth with him a few times and then I said, Oh, you are Indian.  Can I ask you a question?  He said yes.  I asked him why Indian men always gang rape young girls, and was it because your women are so ugly and hairy?  He started screaming at me F-U, F-U and on and on, and I said F me?  Thats what your mother, wife and sister told me last night.  He kept screaming at me until I finally told him he was a FN AH and he should go F himself and die, and hung up.  He actually called back a screamed at me again!

              I keep getting this call.   One of the guys actually gave me a number.   210-807-9500.  I called the number and told the outsourced guy (not naming any nationalities, nor do i need to) to take my number off and that what they were doing was illegal.  He hung up on me so I kept calling the number over and over again.  Poor guy will have to get a new cell phone.  He will eventually get tired of having to hang up from his phone being blown up.  I hope they call again.. going to have fun getting on their nerves,.

              Hi there,
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry to hear about this happening to you. You can indeed uninstall the remote software they may have installed. Typically they load: LogMeIn, TeamViewer, Ammyy, etc..
             </p>
             <p>
              That should prevent them from directly accessing your computer again.
             </p>
             <p>
              More than likely they installed clean versions of free software on your PC, so the choice is yours whether you want to keep them or not.
             </p>
             <p>
              As far as your personal information is concerned, I would definitely change all of your passwords and keep a close eye on your bank/credit card statements in the next few weeks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally, we have set up a page with additional information for victims. Feel free to check it out and leave us any questions you may have:

              just received this call from 855-539-4928, unknown caller on my caller ID.  it was a woman telling me there was a problem with my computer. i kept trying to ask for info and she kept telling me there was an issue that the server alerted them to.  she said she was from windows; she said windows numerous times.  i asked how she got my information; she said that the company got my number from the server and that it showed a problem with my windows and i told her i dont use windows; she said she SAW that i used a mac. she said that she SAW i lived in new york and that someone in south carolina was trying to use my IP address. i repeatedly said i didnt give out information on the phone and she kept saying she wasnt asking me anything, just to go to my computer and shed help me fix the IP address issue. i said i was at my computer and she asked if i saw the control key, i said yes; then she asked me to press the menu key next to it.  i said there was no menu key next to it and she said, is there a function key?  i said yes, but then i asked for her company name and a callback number; she said all time tech support, 855-539-4928.  i googled the company/number and its listed online.  im glad im tech savvy enough to know this is a scam but i can see people getting sucked in

              Bummer, you could have strung her along for a good half hour at least, before you closed on a sarcastic note to really floor her.

              These amateurs need to be taught a lesson in humility. That and theyre honestly not smart enough to be called social engineers, its just that a lot of their victims are THAT naive, so its nothing to their credit.

              Had one of these calls, the (shock, horror, surprise) indian guy said I had a bot infecting his servers. I decided to play along, my goal was to tie him up on the phone for as long as I can to stop him harassing other innocent people.
             </p>
             <p>
              I asked him what my ip address was that was showing up on his end. This poor imbecile had a hard time comprehending the simplest networking concepts. He said my ip was 192.168.0.405! What an idiot, I asked him what my outside ip address was and he repeated the same bogus ip address.
             </p>
             <p>
              I told him he was full of bull and asked him if his scam actually worked and then I laughed to his face and told him that I had a virus and wanted to jerk him around for my amusement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I told him that there was a meesage on my screen saying that mohammad was doing something very bad and vulgar to shiva. (I should have got his religion so I can be appropiately culturally offensive) He sheepishly said why are you saying mean things like that? I replied, because you are a con man lokking to steal of hard working people, whats wrong with you; coulnt you get a job at Dell?
             </p>
             <p>
              I hurled a couple of indian insults I know and just kept laughing at him, he hung up at that point.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope someone calls back. I want to see if I can break this record, I wasted about 10 minutes of his time. It was so fun!

              this past yr i think they has called me around 4-5 times. i just got another call today. i just told them they got the wrong number this time. the first time they called me it just didnt seem right. i been using windows since windows 95 &amp; since that time i never had received a called from microsoft. i knew something was up so while i was talking to them i did a google on microsoft support calling me.  it showed pages of phone scam this or fake tech support calls. so i knew it was A SCAM &amp; after that i just hung the phone up. ever since that first i have tried not to talk to them.

              Im calling about your Windows computer  Is anyone trying to shut these guys down?  They have called me once a month for 3 or 4 YEARS now, the latest being yesterday.  They must not refresh their calling list, because every time they call I tell them I know they are a scam, and have resorted to using very colorful language to keep them from calling back.  They use several phone numbers plus sometimes no number is displayed.

              Well, youll be pleased to know that we in Australia cop this crap as well. My wife had someone (of whom Ill just refer to as Taj from now on.no reason) call and say that he was from Telstra; our service provider. Same deal though, but she strung him along, pointed out inconsistencies in his story to make him sweat a little, and finally made him sit on hold for 20 minutes before returning, using that time to call Telstra (the real one) on the other line. There was little they could do about it, but it was still worth it to hear the background collective nawwwwwwww of at least ten other people when they realised there was no sucker to be had here. And thats just one of the reasons I love her so much..Take that Taj

              Ive gotten fed up with getting calls from them almost daily. I decided to use a police whistle next time they call so I could blow out their ears and theyd know not to call this number if they want to keep their hearing, but a friend said thatd be too cruel, so I decided to at least give them a warning, that if they call my number again (and Ive confirmed that they know the name attached to the number they call), that if they call again Ill use the whistle. Maybe theyll heed my warning and blacklist my number; maybe theyll call again and need a demonstration before they blacklist me. How could they get back at me  call me more? Ill just make more of their callers deaf!

              I received the phone call 2 nights ago from an Indian accent man saying they were receiving windows errors from my pc. I asked him what his name was and company name was and his phone number. He replied Eric Jones 888 239 4334 and Digital Products Direct. I basically than told him i knew they were a scam and told him i was reporting him etc. I called back the number and indian guy answered saying Justin (same guy) and i asked for Eric Jones. He (same guy) than spoke to me again and i told him the same thing and that i was keeping him on the phone to preventscamming others. Next night Indian guy calls(probably same guy) and says he is from Windows Helpers

              Just received the call from a man with an Indian accent.  He didnt seem to care that I said this was a scam or that I would have my IT person fix any problems, but kept trying to convince me that it would only take a minute and I could fix it myself.  But I did get his number which was 646-455-1312

              I had a call from the what I will call india Scammer about two hours ago.  I kept him on the phone for about a half hour before he finally realized I was on to him.  At that point he started to get belligerent and I started making fun of him.  He then started to curse at me and call me all the names in the book, his favorites were A**h**e, Fing A, and then he tried to get to me when I asked since he knew my pc had a problem what my IP was and if he knew what an IP was to get it from my Moms panties.  After about 5 more mintues of him cursing at me and me continually laughing at him he finally hung up.

              Ive got a similar story about a guy that phoned up claiming to work for Microsoft and that there was a virus on my computer. I live in Wales and the guy had a thick indian accent and told me his name was Dewi Evans, I kid you not. When I asked him how he had been given such a welsh sounding name when his accent didnt match, he hung up on me, hopefully to the sound of my guffaws.

              I told the scammer that I was part of the department of defense and the virus cause a missile launch that went against the person on the other end of the phone line.  I warned them that a missile would hit them and they should get out.  They said, where am I (them).  I said it was confidential and they were about to be bombed.

              Five such international calls this week alone. I usually calmly inform them  that their call to the user they had phoned has been automatically redirected to this office at interpol and that their call has already been traced to their server location. Usually they hang up  but today before angrily slamming down the phone,  they told me I would be disconnected from Microsoft within 48 hours.

              Why didnt he just unplug the PC to prevent any more changes? A scammer cant do a thing to an unpowered PC.

              Hey Dakotaga
             </p>
             <p>
              Im sorry to hear that you fell prey to this scam. We here in India are trying hard to against this unethical practice but I guess Im too alone in this battle. Ill tell you, in 1 Indian city, there are about 500 fake tech support centres like the one that bugged you. Even big names like iYogi has been found to use these scary tactics.
             </p>
             <p>
              But before going further, I would like to make it clear that you dont need to worry much as the money you gave them i.e. $180 is a big amount in India for 1 day, not many high paying jobs offer that kindof a payout. So they pretty much got what they wanted.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I would like to tell you some more tips.
             </p>
             <p>
              1. Microsoft or Intel never calls a customer, they dont even have a free phone support.
             </p>
             <p>
              2. US mail server (govt) doesnt exist. I mean just think, why would the Govt be selling you anti-hacking softwares.
             </p>
             <p>
              3. Anti-hacking software, the big word. Theres no such thing and hackers only get into a computer for something like card details etc unless its a maniac.
             </p>
             <p>
              4. The best protection against hacking is already in the computer i.e. Firewall. You just have to put it on. A decent antivirus too will help.
             </p>
             <p>
              5. Never make a payment through a voucher like Green Dot or Money Pack, because its difficult to track them &amp; you wont be able to get the money back. Paypal &amp; other trusted gateways are a much safer option.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lastly, I need to tell you that I, Ajay from Delhi, India too is running a small tech support centre. My firm is registered in Delaware, US. However, we have an ethics code in place &amp; my agents are strictly advised not to force sell or upsell on any tech support calls.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let us join hands against these scammers.

              I got yet ANOTHER call from these persistent clowns today. They have been calling every 2-3 weeks for the past year, Ive always known it was a scamso I mess with them to waste their time. The heavily accented guy calling from windows insisted this wasnt a scam after I repeatedly kept saying it over &amp; over. I asked him where he was calling from and he said Phoenix. I asked him what time it was and after a 15 sec delay he said 2pm . It was 1:25pm here in California and I dont know of any 35 minute time zone differences between here and AZ. I told him if he cant even tell time, why would I let him fix my computer (which there is nothing wrong with). He hung up.

              For some reason the moment I first powered up my new computer and connected with Microsoft, one of these scamers called. I didnt believe him and told him no thanks and if I saw any problems I would call Microsoft myself.  A few days later (today) another one called me (late at night) and when he told me he was from Microsoft technical support I told him I didnt believe him.  He said You dont believe me?  And I said No, and he hung up.  I am wondering if the fact that I had just bought a new computer and connected with Microsoft, that they somehow knew this and were directed to me and my phone number?

              I think this awesome!  I cant think of a better way to get back the scammer!  I was called by two Indian guys myself.  They got me all the way to the point where they were asking me for the license # and I told them I did not trust them and hung up. ( Fortunately I hung up before giving them the number. I also kept asking for identification and what the purpose of the call was.)  They were slightly rude and insistent which tipped me off that this was not a professional call.  I also argued with them the whole time and told them that Windows has never once called and that the call was highly unusual.  Before I hung up I told them I would call Windows myself. Click!  But personally I think what you did was much more clever.   Good job!

              I just got a phone call from a man with a heavy accent  telling me that my PC may be infected with several viruses. I asked where he was calling from and he told me  PC technical support. It showed up as an unknown number. I went on to tell him how I havent used my PC in over 6 months. All of a sudden the call was disconnected.  Definitely a scam and I  outsmarted him.

              Just got the call a few minutes again. I knew my PC was registered with my employer and my phone number is not connected with it so my first question was how did you get my number in connection with my PC? She replied; When you purchased the PC you registered the phone number I told her that is not possible as it is a company PC.. She said Go fck yourself..Fck your sister.. OMG.. First time a scammer was so easily ****** off! She hung up..

              Yup, I got this scam.  Sounded fishy from the start.  They said theyre getting messages, used the ALT-R keys, and then I asked them if they could simply give me the TIMES of the last five Event calls they received.  She said  You can see those, sir, so just. and I kept interrupting, saying, No, YOU tell ME what my computer is sending YOU!  Of course, they couldnt.  While all this is going on, I Googled this situation, and a pile of sites came up with this exact description of scam.
              <br/>
              I let her continue to waste a pile of time with me, figuring every minute spent wasted on not getting anywhere with me will slow them down from getting some other poor schmuck.
              <br/>
              Then finally ended it, reading to her exactly from this website, giving the exact description of the scam theyre about to spring on me, and she shut up.
              <br/>
              End of call.
              <br/>
              PS:  This number came from 548-965-4254.

              Just received that call today. Thank God that I listened to my inner thought. I hang up after he said press window R. This dude knew my name.I was really suspicious at the start of the private number.

              Mistake was not qualifying the caller in the first place.  Theyve been calling me for days now.  The first time,  Habib told me my computer blah blah blahI stopped him and said if you know this then you know the IP address of my computer is  what is it?  Dead air, hang up.
              <br/>
              The next day a hotshot with less noticeable Indian accent called and I pulled the same thing.  He was Ready!.  My address is 192.168.1.1.  Coincidentally, thats the default address for most any router/modem you buy here.  So I said Nice try  thats not MY addresshe got ****** and hung up.
              <br/>
              Got another call the next day and same thing  they now have IP address is  in their script and asked them so you know my IP address, what is my email address and what OS am I running?  MAC or MS?  HANG UP with some muttering.
              <br/>
              Today I got a call from a girl (Indian accent always).  I said,  look, youre calling from India  please just stop calling me!  No sir!   I am calling from blah blah in New Jersey.  I then said, Okay, so youre in  the US?    Yes  So I said, Well, I am on the US Government Do Not Call List and you are in violation of US Federal Law!   Can you give me your full name, phone number and the name of your company?  CLICK!

              First time they called this week I simply pushed the caller on his working for Microsoft and he quickly disconnected.
              <br/>
              The next call I told the woman that I didnt know why she was calling me as all I had were Macs. Again, a quick disconnection.
              <br/>
              Call 3 and I asked what operating system. Windows. Which version? Windows 8 Im not running Windows 8. 8.1? No. Click
              <br/>
              Call 4 just came and I wanted to see how far I could take this.
              <br/>
              So I decided to ask what the address of the computer in question was.
              <br/>
              Hold on and he clearly didnt know what to do, so he asked if I meant the IP address. I said yes. Now Im starting to push and I say, if youre getting error messages from me, you have to have the address handy. More uncertainty on his part. I then said admit it, youre Roger from Bangalore and youre not conected with Microsoft. Oh no, I am with Microsoft, but I am in India. Finally he gives me an IP address. The first two numbers he gave me were letters. I asked him to repeat the address. Click.
              <br/>
              I cant wait for the next call.

              Yeah, I asked one of them which computer and which OS during one of these calls a few weeks back. He quickly hung up.
              <br/>
              Another time, one of these people called and I just flat out asked what he was selling.

              I now just ask them if their mother is proud of them, and if she knows that they cheat people for a living, and that this is evil.  If they say they dont cheat people, I tell them they cheated MY mother, and ask if THEIR mother approves of them cheating mothers.  They usually just hang up, but yesterday a girl told me that MY father knows ALL about me because he [sexual act]s me, and hung up.  She had an excellent grasp of English and idiom.

              I had the same thing happen to me. I played along it happened exactly like this. I did not let them go as far. They wanted me to download Team-viewer and I kept talking. Though they got tired and called me  stupid and closed the phone.
             </p>
             <p>
              I took up about 1 hr of their time. I felt good. Thanks for the heads up.

              So I got a phone call from Sean at 567746-6113, about fixing my computer. So I played along with pretending to do what he was asking, and fumbling with the instructions. So after about 20 minutes of fumbling and making him repeat his instructions too many times to count, I told him I had to go. I asked if I could call him back and he said yes his number one was 888-339-2143 Sean id# 8013. So I told him if I didnt callback he was to call me back later in the day so we could fix my errors. So about 3 hours later Sean called back. Again he gave instructions and again I kept fumbling for about 15min. So then we got to the part where he wanted my Team Viewer id and password. So I gave him some made up numbers and for the next 10 minutes we played a game where I read the numbers to him, and he could not log in. So he would read them back and Id change a digit here and there each time until I got bored and told him I dont understand why its not working. So now he put me on hold and John Jackson got on the phone and told me to go through the whole process over. Works for me, its their dime. So we went through all the steps from the beginning, only to end up with them still not being able to access my computer. So John gave me a web address to go to, at which point I started to laugh. He asked what was so funny. I proceeded to tell him that I knew of his scam and he should be ashamed for stealing peoples money. He didnt say much accept questioned why I would waste his time. Then Sean got back on the phone and tried to forcefully tell me it wasnt a scam and he was trying to help me. So I asked him if his mother knows hes a dirty thief and if she would be proud of him. He got angry and told me they were trying to hack my computer and now h was going to DESTROY my computer. LoL!!! I started to laugh uncontrollably which only made him more angry. He was yelling about how he knows where I live, what I do for a living, everything about me, and was going to destroy me. So I told him I was scared and would pay him not to destroy me. He said, Okay then I needed to get on my computer and do what he said. I told him I changed my mind, that Ill take my chances with destruction, and he should get back to being a piece of crap and scamming people. I thanked him for allowing me to ruin his day, and waste their money on long distance charges. Then the phone line went to a dial tone. I hope Sean calls back, cause he was fun to mess with. Or maybe I can call him, if this number he gave me is real. Too funny!

              My niece put a service call to Microsoft about her laptop which is still under warranty.  And some time later she got this scam call purporting to be from Microsoft.  just a coincidence.   She assumed it is a genuine call from Microsoft and started talking to them.  I over heard the conversation and put an end to it.

              I am getting several calls a day from these scammers, I have been subjected to timewasting and verbal abuse.  It is getting me down now, and I dont want to answer the phone any more.  What have I done to deserve this horrendous treatment?  I am on edge all the time in case the phone rings and it is making me ill. Why cant any one stop this constant abuse that comes into our homes.  We pay for our phone line and the communications company should come up with a way to stop it.  It is making my life a misery.

              I do house calls for computer repair to a small group of people as I only work by word of mouth.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just got a call from one of my clients, she had just received a call in this exact manner. She wasnt home to sit in front of her computer so she declined, and then called me worried.
             </p>
             <p>
              I advised off the top of my head to not respond or do anything with anyone over the phone or on her pc.
             </p>
             <p>
              I then did a quick search not too surprised that this has been going on for awhile.

              Unfortunately even with the advent of so much new tech saturating the world, people know about as much about it as how their car runs, most only know it needs gas and to take it into a mechanic when the check engine light turns on, and even then its not a guarantee. So as mentioned above, this is probably still a lucrative scam.

              I am so sorry this happened man. Thank you for going through the process, I have often times wanted to see how far things would go and now I know what the end result may be. I hope those ****ers get arrested

              I went through twenty minutes trying to punch the word eventvwr into the command prompt box. Told him I restarted the computer and then repeated each letter as he said it in sequence.  About forty times. e as in edward  v as in victoria. e as in edward m as in mancy. guy kept getting mad and and correcting me after about thirty minutes I typed it in (in shed at time having a beer cleaning tools with phone on speaker no computer) then told him I thought he wanted me to type it in the search box on the start menu.  He started asking me if i was hopeless and unemployed and I told him I couldnt understand him and casually asked if he was retarded.  He threatened to kill me and my family and bomb our home  then started cursing with every dirty word he knew. I told him I didnt know his mother and hung up.. He called back and left a hilarious broken English message on my answering machine with every curse he knew. Was really funny and hopefully they wont call back. LOL

              Err, wot? A virus or trojan simply doesnt work that way. The best you can do is reverse the screens, copy the file over and then run it from their side.
             </p>
             <p>
              The idea what you can magically plug a pendrive in to your machine, having it copy the file across to them (assuming they permit it) and then that it runs automatically, with no user input whatsoever is daft.
             </p>
             <p>
              While i appreciate the need to get back at these people, there are far more effective methods.

              I have had this happen twice. The first time was a few years ago from an Indian woman; today it was from someone who sounded like her brother. I berated him with a barrage of obscenities and told him to go eff himself, then hung up on him. Wish I had thought to ask for his name &amp; number and then tell him I was reporting him to the FTC.

              I had that call. I first asked the woman about the privet number. I went along on the phone for about five min until i was transferred to a man that was willing to explain. In the end he told me F.You and hung up.
              <br/>
              I was completely polite but did not trust him.

              They called me on Thanksgiving when I had a house full of people. I asked them to stop calling and asked if they ever heard of Thanksgiving in India. They called me again this morning( Friday after Thanksgiving ) and I saidQuit Calling and hung up. Immediately, they called again. I called him a few choice words and hung up again. 10 more calls within the next 5 minutes. He would swear at me and I would swear back.  Finally the calls stopped coming.

              This scam is alive and well. I just got the call today, except the caller was cognizant of a Microsoft TechNet post I had written about failed Windows Updates. This seemed to lend some legitimacy, especially considering he knew my name and the post, and knew my phone numberdespite the fact my phone number wasnt a part of the post. So this guy obviously did some digging before calling.
             </p>
             <p>
              When the call progressed to the Team Viewer point, I knew something was wrong. Ive used Team Viewer before to help my parents with their computer, but I knew the errors on my computer were not severe. I did a quick Google search on Microsoft errors team viewer and found this article. I promptly told the guy I thought he was a scammer and hung up.

              I prank these guys all day longI will call, tell them I am getting pop ups, then conference in another scammer.  They fight for a good 10 minutes and try remoting onto each others computers.  It is good times.

              Hi, I am Asma from Hyderabad
             </p>
             <p>
              I feel ashamed to admit that I was a part of it too. But believe me I had no idea about the scam. It was my first job ever, I  worked there for 36 days &amp; They made more than 3000 dollars through me..
              <br/>
              I Left the job when I realized its not legitimate company (so I never got my SALARY )
             </p>
             <p>
              In the end, I have wasted my time, money &amp;  energy, fooling people while my husband needed me in the hospital.

              I just received one of these calls.  Indian accent, claimed he worked for MS.
              <br/>
              I asked him how he got my number and he stated that because of a virus, the information was sent to MS.
              <br/>
              I then asked him for a phone number to verify where he was calling from.  He stated he would provide it after I did the Windows/Control R.
              <br/>
              I asked him to prove he was from MS and he said he had my ID #.  I asked for it and he again told me to hit Windows/Control R.
              <br/>
              I told him if he had my ID, give it to me and then he rattled off this 32 digit ID.  I new he was a fake then and told him I just didnt feel comfortable doing what he requested.  He asked if he could call back, I said sure and then proceeded to check out Windows/Control R and found this site.
              <br/>
              I also removed the approval for connecting remotely.
              <br/>
              If he calls back I think Ill just string him along and use the information from this article to pretend I have given him access.

              Just got off the phone with them. I knew from the first sentence the guy was a fraud plus, I am a certified Microsoft engineer, certified also in VMware, Cisco, several EMC and Symantec products, and I work for one of the largest computer vendors on the planet so I was driving and letting him talk me through all the screens he wanted to scare me with. I would reply with something like this I see event viewer I am just not seeing one red or yellow icon! my favorite part was when he had me count the services that were not running and told me that this is a huge problem. This is why my PC was in grave danger. All in all, I kept them from harassing someone else for about 50 minutes before they finally just hung up on me. Kept me awake while driving. What sucks is for every one of us that know what we are doing, they are catching those that dont. There must be a way to expose these idiots on a grand scale.

              Just got the call this morning, same MO.  When I checked my msconfig as instructed, I noticed that most of the programs that were stopped were either done so voluntarily (by me), or involved what looked like to me to be remotely controlled programs or programs that might allow remote access to my system.  When I told the caller this, he resisted &amp; repeated his line that they indicated that my system was already shutting down, bit by bit.  I finally said to him that I wanted to check &amp; confirm this on Microsofts website and that he would be welcome to call me back later.  At that he hung up without a word, leaving me to think, more so now, that it must have been a scam.  Sure enough, a quick check for microsoft msconfig scams brought up this webpage.  God, I hate this  especially the thought of so many clueless folks that would &amp; are easily bilked by this &amp; other similar scams.  Thanks for being here to confirm my suspicion.

              I did this once a few years back but it wasnt a call that I received I called a number that came up on Google when I search Microsoft Tech Support and the Technician remotely took over my computer. I think they gave the same run about, about why my computer was running correctly and told me I had to pay that outrageous amount for them to fix my computer.  The thing that was different about that time was he used a system called LogMeIn  not TeamViewer. He didnt go through and delete anything on my computer though.

              I just got the call and instantly recognized as this scam. Dont know if anyone else has tried this, but I decided I would ask the person calling, if they knew that this was part of a scam. She responded with, who told you this, I was about to explain when the connection was dropped. Could it be possible that these people calling, really think they are helping and dont know they are part of a scam?

              I think its highly likely that many are clueless.  Most people who work in call centers just work off of a script with no idea as to whats going on behind the curtain.  I used to work in a call center myself, but the calls were incoming reservations, but the same idea is there  supervisors have the ability to listen in to your calls without you knowing and they can disconnect or intercept calls in progress if they need to.

              Just got this call from Windows Tech Support regarding misuse of my user account online.  Seemed like a pretty obvious scam, so instead of pressing win+r as requested, I pulled up my system properties  and asked him to tell me what my windows user ID is. Kind of funny, he said You know your windows user ID? Just hang up now. in a really defeated tone of voice and then hung up on me. Easy win

              I had the same problem. He told me all my banking info was compromised. And it would take $4K to fix it. He claimed to be from a company named Avangate, said his name was Alexander with a middle eastern accent. When I refused to buy his product/service he screwed up my operating system and said all my money in the bank would be gone by morning. I had dealt with Avangate 3 years prior, but I contacted them. Now Im afraid to even get online. Im very paranoid about this because I am retired on a fixed income.

              We had a call this morning. My husband answered the phone. He asked the caller how they got our number as we are ex-directory and they said we are current Windows users so that it how they got it. My husband told them it was a load of bolls, nice try, goodbye. We did 1471 after the call and of course no number available. It makes my blood boil!

              They always curse me out. I must have a way of getting under their skin! Today, in a comically thick Indian accent I was told to take his penis and put it on my wifes vagina last time the guy just ended up screaming at me Your mothers vagina over and over Oh what fun.

              BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA Im sorry, this is so funny. I just got this phone call and I knew IMMEDIATELY it was a scam. Same guy, indian accent, trying this crap. I simply said: Sir, this is a business and anything involving operations needs to go through our main office. *long awkward silence* to which I replied Yes, thats what I thought. Good day, sir.

              LOL.
              <br/>
              I got a Call like this This morning and there it was.
              <br/>
              A lady with a thick Indian accent telling me that I had a virus on my Windows Computer.
              <br/>
              I kept mishearing her. So I asked her to repeat herself many times.
              <br/>
              She repeated that I had a virus on my windows computer.
              <br/>
              I said, But which Computer?
              <br/>
              She said, Any Computer
              <br/>
              I immediately hung up.
              <br/>
              For some reason my subconscious is saying that the fact that she said any computer was supposed to be really funny. I thought it was probably because I thought/knew that viruses are computer specific and cant just be on any computer.
              <br/>
              Lol, I suppose I can only translate her sentence of any computer into Well use any computer to Blackmail/hack/trick you for your money.
              <br/>
              Anyone else want to explain why I felt like laughing when she said any computer?

              Every time they call me, I always tell them my computer is a mini laptop called a CR-42 (Got mine for free eons ago with free 2 year Internet connection from Verizon). But they still try to get me to open a CommandWindow. I say: Im sorry, it says not recognized as a valid command. Then I ask them: You do know what a CR-42 computer is, right? If you are really from Microsoft, you would know that it does NOT USE WINDOWS! It doesnt even have a hard drive! In fact, it boots up in 8 seconds (used to be 20 seconds when I first got it). I tell them they need to go get re-certified if they plan on calling me again. But they still do and they get more stern each time another Bimbo calls. To make it even more frustrating for them, I have added a special outgoing message on my answering machine to take my calls when I am not home. The outgoing message is in my voice and I say:  Hello? ; Hello. ; Hello?! ; Helloooooo.; Please leave a message after the tone. BEEP! The messages always puts a smile on my face. Life is good!

              Just got a call from an Indian call center claiming to be from Computer Maint Dept, I kept him on the phone for awhile, just to waste his time, I kept asking for the company name (I think he said Global Technicare) ,  the phone number the gave me was 361-651-2304, have no idea if that is real, I am not calling it.  In any case, aside from keeping them on the line to annoy them, I would never give them access just to see how far it would go  seriously??     10 min later got my daily telemarketing call from HVAC telemarketer,  so annoying. Different one each time.

              I just got the call. I knew it is a scam before I checked the internet about this, before I read this article. Thanks a lot. What I did was simply playing with him (I got a male person on the phone line). I keep interrupt him with some kind innocent question, such as where do you get my phone number? how come my phone number get embedded in my network error message so you know it is my computer has problem? I am using more than 5 computers now, tell me which one has problems, the red one in kitchen or the white one in hall way? he said they are shall use one network, any one of them has problem. ah? Okey then he asked my to press Win + R key, I said I do not have Win key. There is no Windows flag in my keyboard. Cause this is Ipads  the amazing thing was he did not want to gave up even I told him that I like play game, but know where is Game Over point. And I told him, he is right on that spot.

              I have been getting calls from someone with an Indian accent almost everyday for MONTHS saying they are from Windows support.   I have several times told them to stop calling me and they continue to call me everyday.  Several times I have gotten nasty with them and hung up then they started calling from a private number.  The last couple weeks I Have been getting calls from a different person saying the same thing, but this guy must be new because he was stuttering and clearly didnt know what he was doing and my caller id picked up the name Victor Thomas # 315-370-7992   Just to see what he wanted, I asked him what the problem was.  He said someone from an IP in Japan was trying to hack into my computer.  I said oh really?  Whats the IP #?    he gave me the IP # and wanted me to enter into my computer error log and such like you did.  I said no way and hung up.  I have been getting calls from another unknown name and number for the last several hours and they are hanging up on me.  Beware!!   Do not give anyone access to your PC.

             <p>
              Congratulations on the discovery that your job was bilking millions of dollars out of unsuspecting people and having the courage to quit. It sounds like you deserve much better than what you had!
             </p>
             <p>
              God bless and Namaste

              Thats basically what we did as well. Just tell them you do not have a PC and they give up (and of course they do not actually KNOW if you have a PC or not).
             </p>
             <p>
              You know what is even worse about this? The actual callers (who seem to be mostly Indian internationals) they seem to be only doing someone elses bidding (the real masterminds set up a call center). There are some big cowards, lizards and snakes, in the background that is not only trying to exploit people like us, but they have the nerve to actually hire people to do this.

              Comically think Indian accent. You know now that you mentioned it what if there are not only Indian nationals getting hosed to pull a mastermind hackers bidding, but there are some dudes just posing with these accents so that is forces us to psychologically blame Indian folk?

              I keep receiving these calls, too. Every time I tell them to stop calling, to remove me from their list, and that I have a Mac.

             <p>
              Got another call this morning from 580-233-6186. This time the guy on the phone started yelling at me and said it would be a $1000 fee to remove me from their call list. I told him that was BS, and he hung up. Go figure.

              I just got the same call a few minutes ago I finally answered, as they call daily at all hours and never leave a VM, so I decided to end it
              <br/>
              Same thing, hes in the US, where? He hesitated and said NY.
              <br/>
              I asked him how, unless he is a hacker, how can he tell that I have problems with my computer?
              <br/>
              Oh, you have emails sent to you that tell us you have problems
              <br/>
              I asked who is the company he represents, another hesitation, then he said :Instant PC Help:
              <br/>
              I told him that he is in violation of my DNC listing with the Federal Government and I am aware of his type of help (A friend of mine fell for it and cost her an arm and a leg to have them undo what they did to her computer)
              <br/>
              At this point, I simply said: Sir, as far as I am concerned, if you have this knowledge of my computer contents then I consider you a HACKER and I am calling the authorities. CLICK hes gone

              Just got the same call, Im not to tech savvy but knew it was a scam. My son does my computer work for me, so I just wasted his time for a while by telling him I was doing what he wanted NOT. Then I hung up and they tried to call right back. Its getting tiresome as they call at least once a week. Oh, and thanks for the laugh.

              aye f%#@ these scumbags. they just tried to hook me, I think not! I played along for a bit, acting all concerned. lol. the company they claimed to be was   creative support &amp; services llc., &amp; they had been outsourced from Microsoft support. theyre creative, ill give em that. had they tried to backdoor me into allowing remote access, they wouldve found it disabled, on purpose, on both the limited &amp; admin. accounts on this pc. anyway, long story short, when they asked me what I saw on the screen after hitting windows + r, I replied it says take me off your calling list . &amp; dont call me back . or else.

              Best thing is to just waste their time.  Ask them to repeat themselves.  Ask them Which computer? and then say Amys computer? (or some other name) Oh yeah, she was complaining about it being slow.  Let me turn it on.  It is very slow so please wait.  Put phone down for 5 minutes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ok computer has booted up, but it is in safe mode, I will need to reboot.  Put phone down for 5 minutes again.  Come back, oh Amy is now on some website, I will have to get her off of it, hold on.  Oh it is already stalling, let me reboot again
             </p>
             <p>
              Ok, where is the windows key?  Delay them for another while.  Then ask nicely if they can wait while you let the dog outside.  Put phone down for 5 minutes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then continue slowly, and of course, the dog has to come back in, delay again.  Just keep coming up with things like you are cooking, or your cat is making a noise, or your kid needs help, to just waste their time, but also lead them into thinking you want their help because the computer has problems and you wish you could find someone to pay to fix it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only resource of theirs that you can truly waste is their time, and if they never make any money they will leave that place.

              I just received this call tonight from 354-238-0000.  It is the second one this week.  I had heard about this scam and knew not to fall for it.  I could hear the delay in the call (the kind you hear when it is overseas) &amp; the caller had a slight Indian accent.  The first caller told me I was about to download a virus.  I told him we didnt have any computers but they still insisted so I hung up. On the call tonight as soon as they said they were from Microsoft I said I dont have any computers, but he insisted saying that I will lose Microsoft or Windows license (something like that) and my computer will stop working. Again I said I dont have any computers so please stop calling and hung up; I wish Id read some of your responses before I got those calls. My favorites:  1) Putting them on hold while I go to the computer in the other room and see how long they will hold for while pretending to do what they say but getting it wrong  &amp;  2)  Acting like I have Alzheimers and making them repeat everything 3 times then after they get really annoyed, asking about their Mothers vagina.  Appreciate you all posting your experiences!

              Hahaha good work. I am also Indian but never knew that we had center scammers in our country; eye opener. There should be a way to trace these scumbags and their offices so that we can file a police complaint. If this is happening to US citizens, it might be having with people of India as well. Who knows :/ Usually, I receive email scams. They represent themselves as outlook team of Microsoft, telling me to change my password by clinking on their links and if I ignore their email theyll delete my id . these things really rankle me as I get these emails quit often.

              Had someone try to tell me my computer had x viruses an malware. I said, Really? They must have balls of bloody tungsten to get through 5 Antiviruses, 2 firewalls and enough antimalware to bog down the local private WoW server just to dump this crap on little ol me. CLICK.

              I got a call today, April 6, from Mike at 855-798-1901.  I told him off, (Not too nicely) and hung up.  He called me back and stated that a nice lady shouldnt talk that way.  I told him that I wasnt nice and was never accused of being a lady.  I hung up again.  He called me back. I hung up and called him back and set the phone down.  I called him about 20 times before he blocked my number.  Thats what I wanted.  No more calls from this number.  How many out there would like to call that number and set the phone down until theyre so mad the block your number.  By the way, I use an air horn too.    Nothing like blowing their ears out for a few hours.

              Last week, I received a call from tech support department and that person told me that my computer is infected by some files.He is showing me the files used for the permission of windows that are the default files of operating system which cant be accessed.It is very normal to have those files in your computer.He sold me the software that is completely crap for me by saying that it will help to speed up my computer.
             </p>
             <p>
              If your receive any call regarding the technical support and if they ask you to take the remote access of your system, dont let them do so.If you really need any help regarding your computer or you are facing any problem then you can call Go4customer call center, they will genuinely help you in this case.

              I had to share my recent experience with this scam.  I was visiting my grandpas when the phone rang.  I answered and the Indian person said, Im from the tech department calling about your computer, ok.  Immediately, I laughed.  Who starts a conversation like that?!?  Scam alert.  I reply laughing all the time, There is no computer here.  There really was not.  Theres never been a computer, smartphone, nothing in that house.  Then, the guys like, You sound young. HOW OLD ARE YOU?  Dafuq?  Unfortunately, my manners got in the way and I said, Good bye. and hung up.  I really should have had some fun with that.

              I got this call this morning!  I suspected a scam but let them get as far as having me enter the eventvwr, then I asked for their phone number so I could call them back after Id spoken with MY COMPUTER GUY to verify it was possible.  Hang up.  Im almost hoping they call back so I can mess with them some more!

              Sure enough, I got this scam phone call today.  When I told the scammer that I would call my husband immediately and that we would call Microsoft directly, his fear tactic was that my computer would crash in two minutes, and that I didnt have time to call.  On my way to TURN OFF the computers, I went along with him for a moment.  I said, Ok, tell me what to do.  By now I had turned off one of them (just in case) as he told me to press windows+r.  When I asked what that did, he told me that once I did it, I would see.  I asked him a couple more times what it did (I think it opens a screen where I can type commands? But I didnt tell him I had a clue).  By now my other computer was shutting down.  I then asked him one last time, What function does windows+r do?, and his voice continued to elevate, saying, You can ask me a 1000 times what it does, and I will tell you 1000 times. . .   and thats when I said, Sorry, and hung up.  Only after calling my hubby and discussing this with him, did he send me this site and did I read all the fun things people have done to the scammers.  Now I wish I had strung him along much further!
             </p>
             <p>
              Here is the number that he called from, though Im sure its useless:  888 123 5678

              I love the software. I use Malwarebytes on all my machines and families machines and I showed them how to run it once a day in this order, open the program, check for the update install it and then run it and how to get rid of any malware. I highly recommend this software to many as I can as it does the best job catching and fixing malware issues. And I showed them also how to go into SAFE MODE and get rid of the stubborn malware. Thank you for posting this video for everyone to see and if I ever get a call from one of those guys I have several versions of windows on virtual machines for them to play with.

              Again thank you for all you do because without honest people like you who LEGITIMATELY want to help people keep nasty little bits of code off their machines the computer world would be a nasty place indeed.

              I commend you on trying to keep us safe from scammers in all forms both by computer and phone.

             <p>
              Keep up the good work. And KUDOS on the Android support I am ran into several malware on one phone I didnt know I had. Watch our for those Flashlight/torch apps if they are huge and ask for more than permission to use the protocols that open up and turn on the led its likely a SPY program and it can lead to calls like this if they are watching and see you using windows.

              Scary to think that we can be spied on by a flashlight application. No flashlight application should need anything to do with the internet whatsoever. That should sound alarms right there.

              Love your outgoing message!   Ive gotten to the point that if I dont recognize a number on my cell phone, I dont answer it and if I say Hello? on the land line, and there is no immediate response, I either hang up, or, if I am in a creatively foul mood, and have some time, I prepare to engage in messing with them.  Today, I actually kept one on the line for around 15 minutes.  After explaining that my computer was broken and wouldnt boot up, and him saying he could fix it, but didnt seem to understand what a blue screen was and then asking me to try booting using F8, I told him I didnt have time to do that.  When he started with the profanities, as they always do, I giggled and gave them back to him full force, complete with narrative.  I was amazed he stayed on the phone so long.  It almost seemed like he was trying to keep me on the line.  Maybe he didnt realize it was a land line and I wasnt paying for the call.

              I just got a call from them a few minutes ago first one since early last year I never give any info on the phone to anyone about my pc. Yes Indian accent not very polite knows my first name though which is not on my voicemail I use my middle name.  Then proceeds to tell me for days my windows has been showing errors did I know this.  Laughingly I said yes he said you do know if you do not fix these errors in the next 2 days you may lose your internet forever. It will only take ten minutes. I said I can not do this now I am walking out the door to a doctors appt. He very aggressively says it only takes a few minutes do you have windows or mac I said didnt you just tell me I had windows errorsHe says you may lose your computer I said well you will have to call back another time I have to go n he rudely says goodbyeI hate the bad points of being on the internet you just can not trust anyone. I remember the first time I ever got one of those calls they scared me to death. I didnt give in though I said I will fix it thank you n hung up.  My call identifier said it was a call from El Paso, Tx.  Good ole call checkers gotta love em.

              I am a Computer Technician and I feel shame after listening to their conversation. I agree that they dont call you out of the blue if they are scammers. and they will also not force you to buy any softwares. But all online technical support will have to take the remote access of your computer and also that is how they will charge you if it will be a chargeable service. But they will not promt you to paypal or any other transaction platform, instead they will send you contract or the invoice in your email with their company name and registration number. I know there are so many tech support who claim themselves as microsoft technician. But the root of the problem is not tech scammers it is the  internet and websites. They sell and promote so many softwares which your computer never needs. Mostly these softwares try to manipulate your browser so that they can give you suggestions or website that they desire. and once you click on the website or the result they get paid.this is also a scamSo folks if you are so negative that you started assuming all the technicians are scammers then i take pity on my profession and the education..

              I had a fun time with them. They somehow got my cell number. I played along. They asked me if I was the official owner of the computer. I said no. They asked me who owned the computer. I told them it was my employer. They asked me who the employer was, and I said it was the NSA. The Indian woman obviously did not know who the NSA was, so she asked me and I told her it was the large US Govt agency that is responsible for spying and tracking illegal phone calls. Click.she immediately hung up. Interestingly the phone number listed (385-211-0000) is a VOIP number (385 is Utah but 211 is assigned to Voice over IP ). The call was also being routed through 3 different proxy servers and then originated from  another VOIP. I was able to track back to the first proxy server which was located in Pakistan, but I could not get back to the source IP address unfortunately. So the call is probably coming from India, which explains why these guys always have Indian accents.

              They are really bothering me recently. When they call I answer and say Im going to turn on the computer. Then I put the phone down and go about my business. After a while I hear  HelloHello?. A short time later again  Hello? then the phone goes dead. Waste my time, Ill waste their time.

              So Ive gotten 5 phone calls over two days.  First time I called him a scammer and hung up.  Second time I said I didnt know how to turn the computer on, this really baffled the guy, he hung up on me.rofl.
              <br/>
              Third time I told him my husband would beat me if I touched the computer and lastly told him I didnt have a computer.Im laughing over this.  Gotta come up with my next line for these guys.  I mean seriously they are persistent.

              At our house, we are on both the federal and state do not call lists; so whenever anyone calls us, we treat the calls as a circus for personal amusement. One would assume that any reasonably aware phone pimp outfit would consider that people on DNC lists are disinterested in their services; but both phone solicitor management and Shetland ponies are ever optimistic about the possibility of  a reward.
              <br/>
              My goal is to waste their time and entertain myself; while they are on the phone with me, they cant defraud anyone else.
              <br/>
              I enjoy the part where they tell me that my computer is throwing Windows errors. I ask them which computer and they say the one I am currently using  well, we have a number of Linux and BSD UNIX and two Windows computers in our machine room, so I cheerfully point out that Im in a room with several computers, so could they please clarify which one?
              <br/>
              That usually slows them down; sometimes they hang up at that point.
              <br/>
              Sometimes I play along a bit and let them lead me to the part where they assure me that the software they are asking me to install is reputable software. Of course it is  they ask people to download from reputable sites and then misuse the software for nefarious purposes. When we reach that point I innocently ask them, if they can already see all of those infections and errors why they dont just ask me to run a good repair tool like Malwarebytes. This usually results in the use of words inappropriate for mixed company, delivered in a heavy South Asian accent.
              <br/>
              Or sometimes I suggest that all I have running in the room where I am at the moment is an ancient PDP-11 which doubles as a space heater. They instantly vanish into the ether at that one.
              <br/>
              The real fun is when starts when I decide to have an ethnic moment. Thats when I simply answer an enthusiastic Yes to the initial questions and then when they ask me to give them the total, I continue to respond with Yes.
              <br/>
              When the carpet cleaners call and wish to clean my non-existent carpet I have been known to bring in a nice Biddy or three and let the chickens talk to the caller. Or sometimes I tell them I have to answer the door, put the phone down, and time how long it takes them to hang up.

              Did I mention the fun part where I ask them to tell me which IP address and when they give me one I note that address is NOT on our internal network, and were running PAT anyway.

              Just got a phone call with this scam.  I rarely answer calls from numbers I dont recognize, let alone private caller, but its active recruiter time in accounting, so I picked up the phone  I knew right away it was a scam because why would Windows Service Center call me.  So I decided to give the woman I could barely understand a hard time.  I made her repeat herself several times.  I asked her how she got my number (cell phone &amp; not used for any computer registration).  I asked what computer?  She said your windows computer, maam.  I kept saying I have no idea what youre calling about, said I have several computers which one are you talking about  She was starting to really get annoyed with me (haha) &amp; said I need you to sit in front of your computer, maam.  And I finally said thats not possible because Im at work &amp; then hung up on her as she started saying something else.  Hopefully they dont call me back, because Ill just screw with them some more!

              Out of curiosity I wasted about 10 minutes of my time with one of these people today. When I first started getting these calls I would just hang up.  Then I tried asking them questions like where do you work?  How much to you get paid to harass people like this?  They always hung up right away.  So today I played along.  He seemed pretty excited at first, but I was having a lot of trouble understanding him and I needed a lot of help finding the keys he wanted me to push.  Then I decided that my ancient computer had a blue screen of death and we had to wait for a while for me to reboot.  When I told him that my screen was black with little white letters he hung up.   Thanks for posting this, since now that I know what I am supposed to see I can play along for longer and waste more of their time.  What I really want to know is how can we stop these people.  I hate to think of elderly folks getting fooled by this sort of thing.

              Hi,  I was called today.  Stating the same thing that they were from Microsoft etc.  As I was driving it first kinda worried me, I was not at home and I thought maybe someone had gotten into my pc.  I have a macbook pro.  He ask me what time I could be in front of my pc.  I told him about 7:00.  Now I am not a PC person so I am to say the least a novice.  As soon as i got home I went in and checked my pc.  I didnt notice anything wrong.  Fortunately my nephew is a computer guy so I thought I would have him check just to make sure.  Well sure enough this guy calls back promptly at 7:00.  He was very instant that I log into my pc so he could show me the errors that was being sent from my computer BACK to the main PC at Microsoft. He kept going on and on.  I finally told him that if you know my computer is doing this, you must know my IP address by now anyway.  He read off an address, and to tell you the truth I wouldnt know what mine was anyway.  He just kept going on about how I just needed to log into my computer and he would show me.  I told him NO i was not going to log onto my PC and I am not going to give you axcess to my pc.  My nephew is my computer guy I would have him check.  He mumble several words I didnt under stand and I finally hung up on him.  He was waisting my time.  If I had more knowledge about a computer I would have led him on till he got tired of listening to me!

              I have been getting six or seven of these calls per day for a good three weeks. By my second call this morning. I was sick of their crap.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are scum. If I have time I will play along, simply to delay them calling someone who might not realise its a scam. Today, I didnt have time. Shortly after verifying who they were (Maria) and where they were calling from (Windows), somewhere deep in the bowels of Mumbai Microsoft  Hacking Dept. a call centre employee flung their headset across the room with a stream of profanity.

              In other (possibly unrelated) news, my recently-scheduled personal attack alarm battery test went well.

             <p>
              Not had another call so far.

              I had 2 calls today. I was at work and right off I assumed it was a scam because he said I had an error message while doing my updates yesterday. He asked me to go to my pc. I told him Im not at home. He knew my name which was creepy. He asked when to call back so I said 3pm put. He called at 3:10 and said he was calling back to help me. I lied and told him I called Microsoft and they said they never call people. He told me that they are subcontracted. I told him no thanks, I dont need any help and to remove me from their scam list. He hung up. Its a 631 area code. I tried calling back and it would just disconnect. I blocked the phone number.

              So I got this call today, not knowing about this scam. He said hes from Microsoft and I needed to update some drivers. I start to go along with it just to see where this is leading. He asks me to pull up msconfig, so I do, knowing this doesnt hurt my pc. I kept asking him the whole time why he wanted me to do all this and what are we trying to accomplish, but he kept trying to dodge the question.He did say we had to update some drivers for my web browser, which created a red flag as I knew browsers dont have drivers. Anyways, he asked if any of the services have stopped in msconfig. I said a bunch of them are. He said thats the reason my computer is running slow. I told him I just built this pc about a month ago and my computer is running just fine. He tried to get me to go to some website and I told him Im not going there because I have no idea what were trying to do here He finally said I need to do this because I have to restart all these services that have stopped. I told him there is no reason to start all these services because that will clog up the memory and that WILL slow my computer down. He then hung up on me. (for the record, I work in tech support and I fix lots of computers and I never did go to the site).

              Got a call from this number today. The caller, who had an Indian accent, said he was from Microsoft Windowss tech department and was calling because I wasnt receiving their updates. Very common scam. When I called back the number I got a recording saying the number is not in service.

              I went thru this just yesterday and today.  They had tried about 3 months ago and I ended up having to do a factory restore after they trashed my pc.  This time I pulled up their system, my machine had retained their codes #s, programs and names.  She had come thru a link they placed in the pc from 3 months previous.  She did not know what to do when I called her bluff and she could see the complete previous scam.  She tried to make me believe it was not them, I had already called Microsoft, who disavows any connection to them.  I told her I had turned their info into Microsoft, they were pressing charges, she should just back out of my system.  I went to bed, when I opened my machine this morning, it had been trashed completely.  Microsoft recommended a company for me to call because they could not help me, m warranty had run out.  I called the number, English speaking person said no problem, they could fix this, wanted $699 up front.  NO WAY, I would not pay it.  Finally, I caught on to them, when I read back their code numbers and etc again, they said would fix it, but it would cost me $149.  Rather than argue I paid, they fixed the pc, now all I have to worry about is closing my firewall.  They have placed something in my system that I can not close my firewall.  I know nothing, so now have to work out this problem to keep them out of my pc.

              Just spent 7+ minutes on the line figuring from the get-go that it was a scam but wanting to divert them from someone more gullible.A woman said that my computer was sending error and warning messages.Once I brought the wireless phone to the computer and assured her repeatedly that I was at the computer,she passed me to a senior supervisor.

              I have never used Windows personally,and since 1995 my operating system of choice has been FreeBSD.That doesnt keep the scammers from assuming that I am,and thinking that the Windows+R will produce the wanted result.I have 3 terminal windows going in a FVWM session and nothing happens in response to Windows+R,and I dont have a Start button at the lower left.But the time it takes for me to get this through to them is time theyre not using fooling someone.He finally said he had to have the wrong number when I told him no Windows computers were running here.

              We have been getting these phone calls for the past several years.  I just hang up immediately.  My husband likes to use a seriously offensive accent until they hang up on him.  Today I decided to play their little game and see what happens.  I pretended to be an airhead teenager (aaah, those were the days).  Once he instructed me to press the windows key and R, he asked me what was on the screen, and I told him I didnt see anything.  He gave me the instructions three more times and I told him each time I did not see anything.  He then said F**k you and hung up.  Im so sad that I didnt get to break up with him first!
              <br/>
              Curious about how it plays out, since he broke up with me so quickly, I found this very informative and entertaining site.  Thank you for battling the war against those who want to be mean to my computer.

              1st time I got one of these calls I was at someone elses home so refused to even fire up the computer. they got ****** and tried to bully, calling back when I hung up etc. lately I get these calls regularly. I tell them I know what they are, that my husband is a cop, I work for microsoft tech support but used to do their jobdont call back. I think they use me for training purposes.

              when i get a call from a number i dont know,  i answer it . (wit a low monotone voice )  International church of Saten,  Morbious speaking.. how may i direct your call.
              <br/>
              in most case they quickly hang up,  but when they want to start a conversation, i quickly change the subject to a donation for the church of saten, then they try to change it back to fix my computer but i continue with all the bad things that can go wrong in their life if they simpy dont understand the importance of the work being done by the church and  the masters plans for their lives.and without a donation to the church we could not possiable accept any help from them. I emphasize the protection saten and the church provides is worth the minimun donation.. then i tell them donations start at a thousand dollars.   works quite well and who knows with a little luck maybe some bad luck did befall them that day or the next

              I got the call, yesterday.  I told the gentleman that I was very concerned with the possibility of a virus on my computer as I used it to run my lawn fertilizer business.  I kept the conversation going for a couple of minutes, as he told me how my computer was sending them messages, and yes I was infected with a very dangerous virus.  Finally, he asked me if I could sit down at my computer.  I said sure, but asked him if I could ask him just a few questions first.  When he said sure, I asked him if he had a lawn at his home.  I had to explain what I meant, but eventually he stated that he did.  I asked him if he would be intereseted in buying any fertilizer from my business.  He then asked what it was, so I explained that it was manufactured by cows and was commanly referred to as bull$#!+.  Well for some reason, this made him very angry, and he began to tell me I was arrogant.  At this point I told him it was okay, I wasnt interested in buying any bull$#!+ either, and I hung up.  Amazingly, he called right back.  I had my daughter answer the phone who claimed there was no man in the house.  He then asked if she had a home business, to which she answered, Why yes we do, we sell lawn fertilizer.  She made me very proud!
