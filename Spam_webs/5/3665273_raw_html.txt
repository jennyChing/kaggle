   NAVIGATION STARS   by   Bill Anderson and Steve Coe

Telescope users can make use of this listing of prominent stars
to set their setting circles.  Over 70 stars are included, both
northern and southern stars are contained in the list.  Some programs
demand the RA and DEC in hr/min/sec style; some need decimal
equivalents; both have been included.  All positions are equinox 2000.

To get rid of this text, call this file into a word processor and use
a block move of just the data to another file or make a copy of this
file and delete this text until only the data is left.  Then the data
can be loaded into your database manager by an Import Ascii technique.

The fields of the data are as follows:

1)A proper name if the star has one
2)Greek letter designation
3)Constellation in IAU standard abbreviation; all upper case
4)Right Ascension in hr/min/sec
5)Declination in sign/deg/min/sec
6)Magnitude (Numeric field)
7)Spectral Class
8)Decimal RA (Numeric field)
9)Decimal DEC (Numeric field)
