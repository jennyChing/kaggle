     Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
     In January 1972 A film entitled
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     appeared in the 
Warner West End Cinema in Leicester Square. Billed as "being the adventure 
of a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and 
Beethoven", it was clear this would be no ordinary film. It proceeded to 
ignite a serious controversy that penetrated all sections of society in a 
way that was unprecedented in the history of cinema in Britain. Its 
depiction of a young gang of anarchist hooligans raping, mugging and 
vandalising their way through a futuristic dystopian Britain caused 
outrage and significant attention. During the sixty-one weeks that it 
played to the British public, it preoccupied the attention of politicians, 
the media, the church, the so-called protectors of morality as well as the 
youth, police and local authorities of towns up and down the country 
before its director, Stanley Kubrick, in the face of this pressure finally 
banned the film from public exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who was affected most by
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     ? Why was it such a 
sensation, and should it have been banned?
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     inspired a variety of responses from different 
members of British society. John Trevelyan, Chairman of The British Board 
of Film Classification (1956-71), who passed the film with an "X" 
certificate said it was "...an important social document of outstanding 
brilliance and quality".[1] On the other hand according to the 
spokesperson of the so-called "silent moral majority"[2], Mary Whitehouse, 
it was "sickening and disgusting...I had to come out after twenty 
minutes"[3]. To MPs such as Maurice Edelman,
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was 
an incitement to violent crime -- "...the adventures of the psychotic 
Alix[sic] rampaging to music, are likely to have a more sinister effect on 
those who see for the first time see a fantasy realised on the screen. -- a 
fantasy of exciting violence."[4] But for the young themselves it was "a 
subversive tribute to the glory of youth"[5]
    </p>
    <p>
     What exactly was it about
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     that grabbed the 
attention of the British public? Why did it cause such a controversy and 
who was principally entwined within it? Over the course of this essay I 
aim to discover the answers to these questions. In doing so I have 
considered the various contributions of those who helped to shape this 
controversy and to analyse the way in which this film was so unique. I 
have examined the state of mind of the film industry, its regulators, 
politicians as well as the public at the time
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was released. From the media and the reactionaries who called for its 
censorship to the youth who adored it I have analysed the accusations and 
defenses of its unsavory influence and aimed to discover if
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     really was such a rotten fruit.

    <h3>
     The Limits Of Permissiveness
    </h3>
    <p>
     The late 1950s and 1960s have been described by Arthur Marwick as marking 
"a retreat from the social controls imposed in the Victorian era by 
evangelicalism and non-conformity."[6] Indeed, there exist many examples 
to prove that this era was one of liberal reform and social revolution. 
The extent of liberal reform can be witnessed in "The Betting and Gaming 
Act" of 1960, which legalized certain forms of gambling and led to street 
betting shops, gambling clubs and Bingo. It can be seen in Home Secretary James 
Callaghan's decision in 1969 to make the abolition of 
capital punishment a permanent fixture[7]; and furthermore in 1967 when 
supported by the government, and several Conservatives, the Liberal MP, 
David Steel had put forward the "Abortion Act" which enabled a pregnant  
woman a legal abortion on the mere evaluation of two doctors believing it 
was necessary on medical and psychological grounds. The social and even 
sexual revolution of the 1960s can be defined by legislation that made 
divorce more easily attainable under the "Divorce Reform Act", the "Sexual 
Offences Act" which no longer made a homosexual act between two consenting 
adults an offense, and even the introduction of the Pill, which had the 
effect of "contributing to a general sense of security for women and girls 
and to a situation in which contraception (something no respectable girls 
would have dreamt of mentioning ten years before) could be spoken of 
openly"[8]. A picture of a more tolerant and liberal society seems 
apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the fashion for miniskirts and hot-pants to the increased consumption 
of illegal drugs like cannabis, amphetamines and LSD, through the words of 
popular songs of the time to gang fights at the sea side -- and as a result 
of the explicitness of certain theatre productions and the increased 
promiscuity of the young -- it seemed as though a revolution had brought 
about a permissive age. But was the revolution complete and had it 
permeated all sections and all age groups in society? How far could 
permissiveness go?
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     is an indicator which holds 
some of the answers to these questions. It shows how the old morality 
still remained and if the film is evidence of the radical Sixties then 
reaction it received is evidence of the conservative Seventies.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Up to the last war the Board clearly considered itself the guardian of 
public morality, allowing no departure from the acceptable code of conduct 
and behavior, the protector of the and image of the Britain in the other 
countries and the protector of cinema audiences from such dangerous themes 
as those involving controversial politics."  Indeed the board claimed, "the 
success of the cinematograph had been obtained by the fact that it was 
clean and healthy to which ladies and children could go in safety."[9]
    </p>
    <p>
     After The Second World War the arts in general enjoyed a sense of 
liberalisation from this policy, which allowed film considerably more 
freedom than before. The B.B.F.C. was evolving and consequently so was the 
content of films showing in the cinema. The board introduced The "X" 
certificate in 1951 to deal with films that were not "merely sordid films 
dealing with unpleasant subjects, but films which while, not being 
suitable for children, are good adult entertainment films which appeal to 
an intelligent public".[10] This was in fact how the board perceived
     <i>
      A 
Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     . However, during the early sixties there was a backlash 
against this post-war liberalisation and people started to ask questions 
about the direction that art was taking. These questions became, as we 
shall see, increasingly more frequent so that by the time
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     was released there existed a great deal still unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1960 the Conservative MP for Wimbledon, Sir Cyril Black, formed the 
"Moral Law Defence Association", gaining the support of the Archbishop of 
Canterbury and the moderator of the Free Church Council. The same year 
another group "Youth Impact" was established to tackle "increasing 
immorality" as well as the "London Committee Against Obscenity". These 
committees although small and practically ineffectual were an indication 
of the changing tide of reaction against what they saw as obscenity in the 
arts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far more influential was "The Women of Britain Clean-up T.V. Campaign", 
which later became "The viewers and Listeners' Association" with the 
notorious Mary Whitehouse at its helm. "Although dismissed as cranky and 
ineffectual, The campaign gathered force until by the late sixties its 
voice was powerful enough to be influential at the BBC."[11]
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the emergence of these groups, the liberal opinion of the arts, 
meanwhile, had encouraged the freeing of the theatre from prior censorship 
under the Theatre Act of 1968. This act came under scrutiny when the play 
"Oh! Calcutta!" was staged at "The Roundhouse" in 1970. Including nudity 
and scenes of stimulated sexual behavior, it aroused instant protest from 
many quarters. Mary Whitehouse, David Holbrook, then a lecturer at 
Dartington Hall, the Dowager Lady Birdwood, founder of the V.A.L.A., and 
Frank Smith, a non-conformist G.L.C. councillor all expressed their 
disdain. In January 1970 the "underground" magazine "International Times" 
was indicted for containing advertisements , "to induce readers to resort 
to the said advertisers for the purpose of homosexual practices and 
thereby to debauch and corrupt public morals". A further charge alleged 
that the publishers had "conspired to outrage public decency by inserting 
advertisements containing lewd, disgusting and offensive matter". In the 
same month a series of lithographs by John Lennon were seized when the 
London Art Gallery was raided. Following an initiative by John Trevelyan, 
Warhol and Morrisey's "Flesh" was shown at the "Open Space Theatre" a few 
days later. That was until 32 policeman descended on the theatre 
collecting the screen, the film projector, as well as the names and 
addresses of those who were present. Although neither of these cases led 
to prosecutions the publicity that they encouraged led the Home Secretary 
to announce to the House of Commons, March 12th 1970,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     There is a great deal of pornography about that is causing a great deal 
of concern to many people in this country...Broadly speaking, I want the 
House to know that I shall support the police when they act in response to 
the police in investigating these matters. It may be that, On occasions, 
they will make mistakes of judgement, but I know perfectly well that the 
country as a whole is extremely alarmed at what is going on in this field.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     In the light of these events the Christian pressure groups united under 
their banner of "The Festival of Light" seeking to inform the public of 
what they saw as "moral pollution". Their route of attack headed them into 
the direction of the cinema:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     The Festival focused its challenge to 'permissiveness' almost entirely on 
the mass media. The Cinema, forced to concentrate on adult themes, 
represented a suitably large and vulnerable target. Unlike the television 
companies, it had no spokesman to defend it, nor any mass public support 
to fall back upon. It was an ideal symbol of the ills in society which the 
Festival was now determined to expose and eradicate.[12]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     What was to prove significant, in particularly, to the later censorship of
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     , were the comments made by Lord Windlesham, 
Minister of State at the Home Office, who told his peers in the Lords 
about a circular he had sent to local Authorities, "reminding them of 
powers they have concerning cinema licensing, and asking them to consider 
whether they were making adequate use of these powers, with particular 
reference to indecent or offensive advertisements for films."[13]
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time there developed a great deal of debate concerning the 
emergent sex films which were being produced in Scandinavia, Germany and 
America which by a loophole in the law via the "Cinematograph Act" and the 
"Obscene Publications Act" were making an appearance in private cinemas in 
London. The club loophole had long been a concern to governments formed by 
both major parties. An indication of the neurosis of the time was 
illustrated by Lord Ferrier who assured the House of Lords of a "Definite 
link between international communism and the distribution to adolescents 
of certain pornographic material."[14]
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, the surprise victory in the election of June 1970 was an 
indication of the turn to the right that was evident at this time . It was 
an encouraging sign to the anti-permissive groups. By September 1970 the 
Archbishop of Canterbury was calling on Christians to unite and protest 
against obscenity and blasphemy and so by September 25th, 1971 the 
"Festival of Light" was able to attract 35,000 people to a meeting in 
Trafalgar Square. The Festival's success was their ability to make local 
authorities much more critical of the films they reviewed reminding them 
of their powers over cinema licensing. Beforehand the local authorities 
had been even more liberal than the B.B.F.C. From 1969-1971 they had 
passed films rejected by the Board on some 150 occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this was the sea of moral panic into which
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was launched, it was not aided by advertisements that tended to focus on 
the more sensational aspects of the film. The promotional poster depicted 
the leading character, played by Malcolm McDowell, brandishing a knife and 
a psychotic stare accompanied by the headline, "Being the adventures of a 
young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and 
Beethoven". Moreover, Adrienne Corri, who appeared in the film, confided 
in the Sunday Mirror that she "was scared to see herself," since, "this 
was violence beyond anything I ever imagined would appear on the screen."
    </p>
    <p>
     There were other violent films released at the same time as
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange.
     </i>
     In some cases they were probably even more graphically violent. In 
the film
     <i>
      The Devils
     </i>
     scenes of nuns in a nude orgy aroused enough 
interest to lead
     <i>
      L'Osservature Roman,
     </i>
     the official newspaper of the 
Vatican to pass comment. Furthermore,
     <i>
      Straw Dogs
     </i>
     led 13 critics of the 
day to take the unprecedented step of writing to The Times to complain of 
its unnecessary use of violence and double rape. However far from 
distracting attention from
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     , films such as the 
aforementioned mentioned,
     <i>
      Soldier Blue, Witch-Finder General, The 
Wild Bunch
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      Performance,
     </i>
     only made anti-permissive groups more 
determined to get to grips with
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     . As Guy Phelps 
pointed out,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     Having missed the boat where the indiscriminate violence of
     <i>
      Straw Dogs
     </i>
     was concerned, all kinds of pressure groups, newspaper 'campaigns' and the 
all-purpose commentators who were there in the media now latched onto
     <i>
      A 
Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     as the current whipping boy for the industry's 
irresponsibility.[15]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     It is quite probable that under more normal circumstances
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     would not have aroused so much controversy, but such as it was, the 
scene had been set for the "Clockwork Controversy".
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     -- What was it about?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     started its life as a novella written by the 
English author Anthony Burgess. The first draft, written whilst Burgess 
supposed he was dying of an inoperable cerebral tumor, presented the world 
of adolescent violence and governmental retribution in the slang that was 
current at the time among the hooligan groups known as the "Teddy boys" 
and the "Mods and Rockers". In early 1961 in a fit bill of health and 
realising that the slang of his earlier draft would soon be outdated, he  
decided that the story properly belonged in the future. That year Burgess 
spent part of the summer in Soviet Russia where he observed,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     The authorities had problems with turbulent youth not much different from 
our own. The
     <i>
      Stilyagi,
     </i>
     or style-boys, were smashing faces and 
windows, and the police, apparently obsessed with ideological and fiscal 
crimes, seemed powerless to keep them under control. It struck me that it 
might be a good idea to create a young kind of hooligan who bestrode the 
iron curtain and "spoke an argot compounded of the two most powerful political languages in 
the world -- Anglo-American and Russian. The irony of the style would lie 
in the hero-narrator being totally unpolitical.[16]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Rather than a "nasty little shocker" as the Times Literary section had 
called it, what Burgess had tried to write "was as well as a novella, a 
sort of allegory of Christian free will. Man is defined by his capacity to 
choose courses of moral action. If he chooses good, he must have the 
possibility of choosing evil instead. I was also saying that it is more 
acceptable for us to perform evil acts than to be conditioned into an 
ability only to perform what is socially acceptable"[17]
    </p>
    <p>
     Even at this early stage
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     discovered its first 
potential censor when Burgess' literary agent was unwilling to submit the 
novella to a publisher alleging that its "pornography of violence would be 
certain to make it unacceptable"[18]. Despite this the novella was sold to 
William Heineman Limited in London and W. W. Norton Inc. in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
     A view of what was to come was evident in the pop-following the novella 
attracted. In New York and Los Angeles Burgess claims, "Rock-groups called
     <i>
      Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     began to spring up" and the young interested in 
the language of the book adopted it as a "genuine argot". Even the British 
rock-group The Rolling Stones expressed an interest, in 1965, of 
performing in a film version they envisaged Burgess writing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The film version of the book happened almost by accident. Its director 
Stanley Kubrick had been given a copy of the book which he had initially 
put to one side. On the rebound from the cancellation of the production of
     <i>
      Napoleon
     </i>
     he happened again on the copy and it made an immediate impact 
on him. Kubrick said of his enthusiasm for the project "I was excited by 
everything about it, the plot the ideas, the characters and of course the 
language...The story functions, of course, on several levels, political, 
sociological, philosophical and, what's most important, on a dreamlike 
psychological-symbolic level". When Kubrick wrote the screenplay he made a 
point of sticking very closely to the original text, "I think whatever 
Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book but I did invent a 
few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes."[19]
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the novella had met its critics it was nothing compared to the 
reaction the film was to receive. The more liberal period in the film 
industry which prevailed out of the sixties permitted Kubrick to film such 
graphic scenes of physical and sexual violence. In Burgess's mind, "It was 
the dawn of the age of candid photography that enabled Kubrick to exploit, 
to a serious end , those elements of the story which were meant to shock 
morally rather than merely titillate"[20]. Burgess explains one of the 
elementary reasons why The film itself was more of a "shocker" than the 
book, "to tolchock a chelloveck in the kishkas does not sound so bad as 
booting an old man in the guts...But in a film little can be implied; 
everything has to be shown. Language ceases to be an opaque protection 
against being appalled and takes a very secondary place"[21] Furthermore, 
"The sheer power and brilliance of Kubrick's
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     undoubtedly contributed to the outrage at the film. The images were so 
effective that many viewers were led to believe that the film was more 
explicitly violent than it was."[22]
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was not just these scenes on their own that made
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     so controversial, there was also an element of being in the 
wrong place at the wrong time that added to its impact. There existed a 
certain sense of inevitability that given the contemporary mood the film 
was not going to be judged on its own merits, but put into a much larger 
context of societal concerns. Since the 1950s more and more onus had been directed 
towards the accountability of the power of films to influence their 
spectators. Many had thought that the arts were going to far and they 
needed to be checked.
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was at the end of a long 
line of hysteria that was bound to lead to its downfall.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>
     Who Was Affected? -- The
     <i>
      Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     Controversy
    </h3>
    <p>
     Violence and crime were on the increase. The total figures for reported 
crime in the sixties were as follows, "11,592 in 1960, 15,976 in 1964, and 
21,046 in 1968".[23] In Northern Ireland the problems had gone from bad to 
worse, forcing the problem of violence into the public conscience. 
Continuous news reports of bloodshed and semi-warfare within the United 
Kingdom had created a greater awareness of violence as a major problem in 
society. As Marwick explains, "The most bitter year since the war of 
confrontation between government and unions was certainly 1972: it was the 
year of the IRA bomb outrage at Aldershot in which five civilians died; 
and it was the first year since before the First World War in which a 
picket had lost his life".[24] This situation is probably what drew the 
Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, who had stated previously that he was 
concerned about the connection between the rising crime rate and cinema 
violence, into the
     <i>
      Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     controversy: "There is a new film out this week that I think I ought to go and see...If 
things are being shown which one could reasonably suppose are contributing 
to the degree of violence, I think I ought to know"[25]. Maudling was also 
clearly aware of the liberalisation of the film industry and worried about 
its effect on the growing wave of crime. "The British film board of 
censors has done a really good job over the years. But I am disturbed  
about the degree of violence which seems to be entering films...If I think 
that this trend of films is doing harm to I ought to say."[26]
    </p>
    <p>
     Having viewed the film at the Admiralty no press statement was issued, so 
one might suspect he decided that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was unlikely 
to cause any harm. However, it is more likely that he avoided comment on 
the basis that if the Home Office was seen to appear dissatisfied with the 
performance of the B.B.F.C. it would have undermined its credibility. 
Moreover it is possible that he had never intended to intervene, but was 
only doing so to appease certain pressure groups. However, Maudling's 
contribution to the controversy had other far more reaching effects,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     To single out for mention a specific film before it has appeared publicly 
is certain to suggest to some people, among the more illiberal forces of 
opinion, that the film merits the scrutiny of the minister responsible for 
curbing the abuses of law and order.[27]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Rather more outspoken was Maurice Edelman, the Labour MP for Coventry West 
and co-chairman of the All-Party Film Committee. Managing to accumulate 50 
MPs and Peers to attend a showing of the film at a Soho Square Trade 
cinema on 25th January 1972 he was quoted in the press,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     The film stimulates for two and a half hours an appetite for sadistic 
violence with the instantaneous communication which the visual arts 
uniquely offer...I believe that when '
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     ' is 
generally released, it will lead to a Clockwork cult which will magnify 
teenage violence.[28]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     If the sea of moral panic, which stemmed from the liberalisation of the 
arts, and Maudling and Edelman's concern at the growing number of cases of 
violence in the film industry, drew the focus towards
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     , then the press put it directly into the spotlight.  Through a 
series of sensationalist reports and headlines it was clear that they aimed 
to focus merely on the more "sordid" aspects of the film, it was pitched as 
the, "FILM SHOCKER TO END THEM ALL"[29].  Ken Eastleigh reported in The 
sun, "The star is Malcolm McDowell, who is seen in a speeded up sequence 
having repeated sex with two dolly birds."[30] and further described the 
film as, "unparalleled in its concentrated parade of violence, viciousness 
and cruelty."
    </p>
    <p>
     The problems really started when the press reported a spate of supposed 
copy-cat crimes. The first and most famous of these was the case involving 
a 16 year old boy called James Palmer who had beaten to death a tramp in 
Oxfordshire. As Edward Laxton reported in the Daily Mirror, in a 
convincing enough manner that the more reactionary reader might suspect 
that,
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was terrible enough to influence even the 
most unassuming and hitherto quite innocent of young men, it was clear 
that the press were going to make the film even more controversial. "The 
terrifying violence of the film
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     fascinated a 
quiet boy from a Grammar School...And it turned him into a brutal 
murderer". Laxton continues, "The boy viciously battered to death a 
harmless old tramp as he acted out in real life a scene straight from the 
movie
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     "[31]
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     began to be developed into an euphemism in the 
press for referring to teenage crime and societal deviance. When a study 
was undertaken to explore the deviance of 1565 youths aged between 12 and 
17 by Dr. William Belson of The London School of Economics, The Daily Mail 
reported, "it is the first to study the clockwork orange society in this 
country."[32]
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Burgess, in particular, jumped to the defence of the film 
commenting, "No evidence has ever been adduced in a court of law to prove 
beyond a doubt that a work of art can stimulate anti social behavior",[33] 
the fact that a psychiatrist had told Oxford Crown Court, "It seems as if, 
momentarily, the devil had been planted in the boys' 
subconscious...planted their was ...the violence of A Clockwork 
Orange"[34], it was inevitable that those who had reservations about
     <i>
      A 
Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     were now convinced of its tragic effects.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite Burgess's continued efforts to point out that
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     was being carried away on a storm of hysteria by commenting, 
"The notorious murderer Haig who killed and drank their blood said he was 
inspired by the sacrament of the Eucharist - Does that mean we should ban 
the Bible?"[35], people in positions of authority were loathe to agree. 
Reverend John Lambert, former chaplain to Pinewood studios commented in 
the Evening News, "I am utterly convinced in my own mind -- and from talking to many young 
people -- that this celluloid cesspool has done damage to more young people 
than just the boy who beat out a meths drinkers brains with a brick". 
Furthermore, just to add fuel to the case against
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     the reverend threw rather an exaggerated attack at Stanley 
Kubrick, "Old people tremble to go out of doors and young girls are abused 
by bands of louts imitating your bizarre world."[36]
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the fact that James Palmer had never seen the film and his 
knowledge of it came merely from his friends accounts, the ball was 
rolling. Even the local pud landlord felt obliged to comment, "I see the 
effects on youngsters who come in here afterwards and act out what they 
have seen."[37] Mary Whitehouse determined, to see the film banned said, 
"Since it has been shown we have witnessed muggings and the start of the 
dreadful gang bang syndrome. One gets tired of the irrational, pretentious 
arguments film makers use to defend their works."[38] Lord Soper, leader 
of the Methodist Church in Britain commented "films like this tend to bring out the worst possible interests in people. It can only encourage 
people into violence[39].
    </p>
    <p>
     But not all those who one would expect to be on the side of the 
anti-permissive groups were as scathing of
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     . John 
E. Fitzgerald, writing in "The Catholic News, commented,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     The film seems to say that to take away a man's choice is not to redeem 
him but merely to restrain him. Otherwise we have a society of oranges, 
organic but working like clock-work. Such brainwashing organic and 
psychological, is a weapon, that to totalitarians in state, church or 
society might wish for an easier good even at the cost of individual 
rights and dignity. Redemption is a complicated thing and change must be 
motivated from within rather than imposed from without if moral values are 
to be upheld. But Kubrick is an artist rather than a moralist and he 
leaves it to us to figure what's wrong and why, what should be done and 
how it should be accomplished.[40]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Furthermore, the chairman of the Festival of Lights planning committee , 
Peter Thompson who had led the crusade against
     <i>
      The Devils
     </i>
     had a more 
personal insight into the film which made him a fan. Thompson had been a 
patient in Broadmoor's special hospital from 1965-69 and it lead him to 
comment,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     To someone who has committed violent acts of and who has been mentally 
ill, this film has a lot to say to society. It is my honest opinion that 
this is the best film I have ever seen. I felt like I was reliving my own 
experiences. In Broadmoor they have drugs that bring you out in 
rashes...Alex's aversion therapy seems to me to be the exact equivalent to 
900mg of Largatil.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     If the effect of
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     of corrupting the young and 
innocent was seemingly apparent in the James Palmer case the press 
exploited some other less convincing cases to back-up their clockwork 
orange theory. One such case was of a sinister character who murdered a 79 
year old woman who was according to the Daily Mail, "praying at her 
friend's grave side". The culprit however, was, it has to be said, not of 
particularly sound mind and judgement judging by his comments to the 
police, "Sometimes I think I am Jack the Ripper, a vampire or something 
like that"[41]. Despite the police report's allegation that he got the 
idea from
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     it seems inevitable that this man 
would have ended up in prison due to the influence of his imagination 
without
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Cases were springing up all over the country leading judges to conclude  
that even minor assault charges had something to do with the effect of
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange.
     </i>
     When a 15 year old boy was assaulted by another, a 
year his senior, in Heywood Lancashire, judge Desmond Bailey said that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     presented "an unassailable argument for a 
return to censorship."[42] Mike Purdy who worked at the "Old Bailey" for 
the Metropolitan Police solicitors provides a different angle, however, on 
these cases:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     At the 'Old Bailey' we kept seeing people on assault charges who had seen 
the film and been impelled to go out and beat someone up. Most of us who 
worked at the court thought this a load of rubbish but unfortunately such 
cases got a lot of publicity and many judges would impose lesser sentences 
in these cases. It got to the stage when we referred to these cases as 
'Clockwork Orange defenses' and it came almost boring as one after another 
tried using this excuse.[43]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     It seems that even the police were carried away by the "Clockwork Orange" 
hysteria. When Frank Boulton a 50 year old wood seller was murdered in 
Newton-le-Williams in May 1973, despite no evidence to support their 
rationale, detectives started a search for a "Clockwork Orange Gang". A 
police spokesman said, "Teenagers in Newton-le Williams have been buying 
similar make up and dress to that used in the film. Special squads have 
been detailed to check out fancy dress shops in the area...The comparison 
with facts in the film are being followed up as a strong line of inquiry". 
These comparisons are recounted to the reader in the same article, in the 
Daily Mail's own inimitable style, "In the film
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     , 
banned in some towns because of its violence, a kinky group of teenagers 
in fancy dress savagely attack an old tramp, leaving him for dead."[44]
    </p>
    <p>
     This wave of hysteria even affected local authorities who had the task of 
deciding whether or not
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     should be shown in their 
cinemas. All sorts of committees were banning the film, public health and 
licensing committees, fire brigade committees. All of them were unfit to 
pass judgement on films, particularly in this situation of media 
sensationalism. In one such case in Hastings in February 1973,
     <i>
      A 
Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was ruled unfit for viewing after being seen by only 
two members of the Public Health and Licensing committee. Although one of 
them did not even see the whole film it was described as, "violence for 
its own sake". The local press condemned their decision in a way that 
spoke for all these local committees, "It is wrong that the public should 
be treated like schoolchildren by a handful of fickle councilors whose 
tastes are not in any way representative of the people they are elected to 
represent"[45]
    </p>
    <p>
     The ludicrous treatment of
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     hit its height when 
Dr. Malcolm Carruthers, senior lecture in Chemical Pathology at St. Mary's 
Hospital Medical School, and Dr. Peter Taggart, lecturer in Medicine at 
Middlesex Hospital monitored the reactions of 34 doctors nurses, 
colleagues and friends whilst watching the film. Monitoring heartbeats 
during the film and carrying out tests before and after the viewing , the 
results were published the following day in the "Daily Telegraph" under 
the headline, "Viewers' Hearts Slowed by
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     So how did all this effect the youngsters? Were they really affected in 
the way that the moral majority feared? It appears not. In fact the youth 
of the day saw
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     in a completely different light. 
What they saw was a representation of a life they already lived. In 
working class urban areas the violence and the tribal identity of Alex and 
his droogs was a reflection of football hooliganism, gang fighting and 
loyalty to your friends and team. Tony Parsons explains, "
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     was like seeing your little life blown up and put on the big 
screen. It took all the consolations of being a teenager in the early 
70s...and made them mythical, monumental, glorious."[46]
    </p>
    <p>
     Most working-class youths referred to themselves as "Suedeheads" due to 
their closely cropped hair styles. "Ben Sherman" shirts, "Levis Sta-press" 
trousers, 6 hole polished "Dr.Martin" boots and braces were the essential 
cladder of the day. Alex and his droogs were just as particular about what 
they wore, "the thin braces, the white strides, the rakish use of hats, 
the combat boots as combined fashion accessory and blunt instrument. It 
was all there. Someone had been paying attention. And we were flattered 
beyond belief."[47]
    </p>
    <p>
     True to the film advertisements, it was the film that youngsters had been 
waiting for, everybody knew about it, "we saw the film and then we read 
the book and then we saw the film again. And even the lads who never read 
books - the thickos , the hard-core thugs, the dims made flesh, blood and 
bone - all read Burgess' black masterpiece."[48] But did it make them more 
violent?
    </p>
    <p>
     Mic Martin, a suedehead and fan of "
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     ", whose 
friends Zac, Col and Sav saw themselves in Alex and his droogs said, "No, 
definitely not. May be it was a validation of our lifestyles, but we were 
not about to rape or kill anyone. We had seen our fair share of violence 
both on the giving and receiving end, but it wasn't about beating people 
up, it was about fighting other groups, allegiance to your football team 
or protecting your friends, whether or not
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     had 
been made, this would have gone on regardless. The film was just a 
stylised version of the lives we were leading."[49]
    </p>
    <p>
     It would seem, therefore, the violence that the press predicted would 
entice the young, was already a part of the young's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was a violent film for violent days ...I saw truncheons coming down on 
number two crops, away fans invading the home fans' end and trying to take 
it, bodies tumbling down terraces, feet and fists flying as one of those 
sickening gaps appeared in the crowd to give violence some room...,the 
football grounds of England in the early 70s played host to weekly rots. 
So the highly ritualised violence in '
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     ' did not 
shock us. We could get all that at home."[50]
    </p>
    <p>
     The concept of
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     as a morality tale was also lost 
on the youth, but Parsons believes, "as we brooded in Ted Heath's Britain, 
we didn't feel we had any choices.  A morality tale?  Perhaps, but '
     <i>
      A 
Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     had a moral heart.  It was a subversive tribute to the 
glory of youth."  Moreover, its appeal was its authenticity: "
     <i>
      A 
Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was about our Britain.  Not the country of someone 
else's mythology -- The Blitz spirit of World War II, the saucy charm of 
the swinging 60s -- but the way we were.  Fishfingers and football pools 
and furniture that was a fire hazard.  Parents that were losing their grip 
and politicians that couldn't get you to turn up.  Authority was crumbling 
on every side and teenage rebellion was turning nasty.  If they attached 
electrodes to Alex's brain then that didn't seem so far fetched in Ted's 
divided nation."[51] The fact that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was so adored 
by a large number of the young, probably added to the fears of the moral 
majority.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Kubrick never thought that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was likely 
to influence it viewers enough to carry out copy-cat crime, he became 
increasingly more fed up with the controversy which he saw to be aimed in 
his direction. Due to reports in the press of the inevitability of a 
clockwork cult, he had delayed the general release of the film so that it 
ran merely in one West End cinema for a year before it went on general 
release . It had not worked. After 61 weeks of showing, Kubrick decided to 
ban
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     in Britain completely. When in November 1973 
a Dutch tourist had been raped by a group of youths whilst singing, 
"Singing in the Rain" it appeared to many that he had done the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Conclusion
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether or not
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     should have been banned is a 
tricky matter. As we have seen the influence of the cinema to corrupt its 
viewers has caused much debate. Those in the anti-permissive leagues gave 
much credence to reports in the press of copy-cat crime, but we have seen 
that these links were often tenuous. The judges who saw case after case 
of "Clockwork crimes" were sure that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was to 
blame, yet Mike Purdy showed us the contrary. So where can we turn? A film 
expert, Claude Chabrol, gives his opinion,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     Of course everybody is worried about screen violence, of course everybody 
stigmatises it. What nobody seems to point out is that screen violence 
opens up dark corners and expresses to public scrutiny a side of life that 
might otherwise remain hidden...Occasionally, film can open people's eyes. 
Do violent films incite violence? I don't believe a word of it. Since 
Aristotle's day, it is common knowledge that people go to public 
entertainments to purge their baser instincts, and they return home 
calmer. They are liberated not corrupted, by the screen depiction of 
criminal perversions."[52]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Ironically the most outspoken critic of the theory that art corrupts, 
Anthony Burgess, had a surprising change of mind . In march 1993, six 
months before his death, addressing public anxiety about a "cult of 
violence" in the wake of the James Bulger murder, he performed a 
remarkable volte-force,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     It must be considered a kind of grace in my old age to abandon a 
conviction that the arts were sacrosanct, and that included the sub-arts, 
that they would never be accused of exerting either a moral or immoral 
influence, that they were incorrupt, incorruptive, incorruptible. I have 
quite recently changed my mind...I begin to accept that as a novelist, I 
belong to the ranks of the menacing.[53]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     It seems clear that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     need not have been the 
sensation that it was. The liberalisation of the arts after World War II 
led directors to push the boundaries of what was acceptable in the cinema. 
But there were more violent films than
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     and 
unlike these films
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     's violence was not violence 
for violence sake, but as Kubrick states, "absolutely necessary to give 
weight to Alex's Brutality".[54] It is inevitable that shocking films will 
cause complaint, but not as much as was received by
     <i>
      A Clockwork 
Orange
     </i>
     . Had the film been released in a different time when 
politicians had not been so neurotic and groups like V.A.L.A and people 
like Mary Whitehouse hadn't been given so much coverage then it might have 
passed by with little notice. Furthermore, being that it was set in 
England with English actors, gave it much more authenticity and therefore 
much more attraction. Had the country been unspecified and the actors 
american then much concern would have been deflected. Moreover, the press 
can be held very much responsible for their part in making the Clockwork 
Controversy. "It is only in Britain that
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     was 
subjected to a campaign of vilification in the press. It is only in 
Britain that Stanley Kubrick had decreed that the film may not be shown in 
the cinemas. These two facts are not presumably unconnected"[55]
    </p>
    <p>
     So was
     <i>
      A Clockwork Orange
     </i>
     really a rotten fruit? To many it seems 
that it was. But had it avoided sensationalising in the press and evaded 
the moral crusade of politicians and the Mary Whitehouses of the 
reactionary cause, it is quite possible that Burgess and Kubrick's story 
could have rode the waves of controversy and still be showing in cinemas 
today.

     54.  "Otherwise there would be moral confusion with respect to what the 
government does to him. If he were a lesser villain, then one could 
say:'Oh, yes, of course, he should not be given this psychological 
conditioning; it is all too horrible and he really wasn't that bad after 
all.' On the other hand, when you have shown him committing such atrocious 
acts, and you still realise the immense evil on the part of the government 
in turning him into something less than human in order to make him good, 
then I think the essential moral idea of the story is clear." --
