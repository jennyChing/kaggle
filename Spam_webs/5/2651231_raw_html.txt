  out this kind of election year rhetoric, similar complaints  no matter which 
  president is being denounced  are common on both sides of the aisle. When the 
  Democrats are in power we hear it from Republicans, and when the GOP is in the 
  saddle we hear similar accusations arising from the Democrats. The reality, 
  however, is that the leaders of both parties know perfectly well that

            JR continues to speak of the U. S. Government as if it was its own master, rather than the chief enforcer of Capital, which lusts to control every natural resource on the planetthough at least JR acknowledges the role of petroleum as the motive for the push to control the Caspian Basin.

            Uncle Sam is not Sauron.

            Uncle Sam is merely the Lord of the Nazgul.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would guess the Empire will die at the hands of the "financial time-bomb" JR mentioned. The capitalists won't tax themselves sufficiently to fund the leviathanic war machine which they need merely to
            <i>
             hope
            </i>
            to capture control of all of the planet's natural resources for themselves. Meanwhile, their foolish policies of shipping all possible jobs overseas, where they can have what might as well be slave labor, has demolished the USAmerican middle class, so the MC can't afford to fund the war machine, either. The only way left to fund the war machine is borrow until bankruptcyand the "bomb" ticks away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once the USA can no longer afford its war machine, who will suppress the righteous rebellions against capitalism?

            Mercenaries? After a few mercenaries are slaughtered on video, and the video posted to YouTube, I rather think Erik Prince and other such orc-lords will find it hard to recruit fresh thugs.

            Where was Ryan complaining about the absence of foreign policy during the Bush years, since Obama is pretty much maintaining what Bush did. All because Obama hasn't sent ground troops, yet, to fight IS. Foreign policy is determined by a response to something like IS of all things? Or because we haven't bombed Moscow? The reduction of foreign policy to war and nothing but war has to be evidence of lack of mental capacity of those demanding it. In some way I guess we should be glad that these paid-for bozos like Ryan and his demented masters weren't in charge decades ago or centuries ago or we'd be walking on all fours again.

            as for policy, as i posted before the definition of policy: A policy is a principle to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes.  so to answer; no, we have no policy. we have no principles other than mayhem, mass death and destruction.  as for "rational outcomes", ha.  find one in the last 70 years.  well maybe nixon with the chinese?

            as an aside about iran, the usa certainly has a long history of meddling in this country.  however, let's not discount the zionist maniacs driving this "policy" of attack attack attack.  and bear baiting is going to work out great both for the world and the usa.  i mean, hey, you can't even successfully occupy or quell unrest in afghanistan but you'll be able to subjugate a nuclear power that has gobbled up every military attack in the last 500 years.  this redefines insanity and the irrational mind of the criminal imposters posing as our "leaders."

            I should like to add another angle.   It is the American way of thinking, pragmatism!.  We have experienced this historically with Mussolini and Hitler. But is has been spread fatally to the population,  to education, administration etc.    What works for this is the complexity of a very large, diverse  population, to which must be added a growingly  complex division of labor, with accompanying bigger difficulties into grasping the ensuing  problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is  an old bad habit among nobles and Kings to see themselves as a priori exceptional and wiser than any single person, or unauthorised group.  The very fact of being in power can tempt the exceptional leader into becoming still more exceptional becoming right also because of basing decisions on prior ones And the way of thinking being predominant.. Llike the modern positivism in justice.   EVERYTHING to the  small or weak mind,  are thus legitimated  to be right and true.

            Kind of a mental illness prevailing.  Back with Nixon and Reagan, one would find illegal administrators punished. Now it is the protesters, that are punished, or threatened against opposing ,  or just revealing,  the madmen in power.

            &lt;&lt;I would guess the Empire will die at the hands of the "financial time-bomb" JR mentioned. The capitalists won't tax themselves sufficiently to fund the leviathanic war machine which they need merely to hope to capture control of all of the planet's natural resources for themselves. &gt;&gt;

            Last night's Republican sweep of the elections, to me, reinforces the notion that the majority of Americans just do not see (or want to see) the rot and corruption in our attempt to control the World. They will not accept that we are financially ruined, nor that our policies are no longer "popular" with 2/3 of the World. We will continue to try to bully, bribe and lie our way to maintain a standard of living that is slipping away through our own faults of militarism, corporatocracy, and extreme income inequality. It will culminate  in an enormous bubble, exploding like a super-nova star.

            The so called "Democrates" were defeated beyond recognition.  The result shows that Obama regime has NO LEGITIMACY what so ever.  Then, why a war criminals who have killed 250000 in Syria alone, wants to topple Dr. Al Assad, who is supported by his population and was elected under terrorist state of US bombing.   The polls show OBAMA HAS NO LEGITIMACY what so ever. Then, the world tell US and Obama regime to f*ck off syria and the Middle East.  You have done damages and committed war crimes against humanity unmatched in the history of mankind.

            The genius of the American System  and the West in general, imo is that "nobody did it."  Carl Schmitt, for example, believed in American "leadership."  The yahoos who speak of "American Exceptionalism" are correct only "not in the sense that they think"  to borrow a phrase from Anton Chigur (No country for old men.)

            The general view that the US goal is to be global hegemon and vigilante is correct.
            <br/>
            But the only real threat to this goal is China since as we have known since Thucydides military power grows out of economic power and China is now the world's number one economy in terms of PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) according to the IMF.  And it is growing at a far faster clip than the economy of the U.S.  And then there is the little matter that China's highly industrious and well educated population is twice as great as that of the EU and US combined.  China does not have imperial ambitions (nor does Russia) but it will not take orders from the US.  The Dragon and the Bear have made it clear that they will not kowtow to the US.
            <br/>
            Russia is in the top 10 economies of the world and growing under Putin despite sanctions but nowhere near number one.
            <br/>
            But it is certainly true that the major powers which operate independently of the US are Iran, Russia and China because they all had revolutions which took them decisively out of the Western orbit and gave them independence.
            <br/>
            And above all China and Russia give weight to the BRICS which represent a growing challenge to the Western economic domination.
            <br/>
            China, China, China.  The best hope of mankind for a  multipolar world  and the greatest obstacle to the global hegemony.

            The USG might consider Latinos and all other nationalities living in USA, legally or not, as its foreign relation, policy, as long as the foreigners can produce and pay their taxes to USG. In regard to USG having a foreign policy the USG looks at all other nations either as the enemy of USG or those who don't pay taxes to USG which is the reason for usg, as Roman Empire did, using its militarism regime to force the payment. Therefore, USG looks at the world as if USG was the religious or militaristic owner of the world. Otherwise, there is no clear, transparent or anything in between where USG insists that the Roman Empire policies is the only "democracy" and militarization, islamization is the only foreign policy In accordance with USG social and economic domestic system, vulture capitalism, there is and must followed with either, one party, monopoly which wants to have the world on its knees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such thing as democracy and its social growth is a thing of the past, in reality democracy is what USG says or think it is, at home however the USG policy and its falsified democracy has developed into a total militarization of what once was, to protect and serve. USG is the creator of a foreign policy which by now every government, nation understand that the USG last result is the total falsification of the word democracy to create terrorism, jihadist and cooperating with those whom have the sources, Saudi arabia, UAE in Middle East in one hand and the modernized Neo fascism in Europe in the other. Don't get me wrong, even the Swedish King is involved and cooperating.

            [] The Obama administration has no foreign policy, says Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOPs 2012 vice-presidential candidate. While we may tune out this kind of election year rhetoric, similar complaints  no matter which president is being denounced  are common on both sides of the aisle. When the Democrats are in power we hear it from Republicans, and when the GOP is in the saddle we hear similar accusations arising from the Democrats. The reality, however, is that the leaders of both parties know perfectly well that we do in fact have a remarkably consistent policy, one that has been pursued with increasing militancy ever since the end of the cold war. Lets step back and take a look.

            There was an economist named Marshall, if memory serves, who said that the biggest thing in the 1950s was that compound interest had been worked into the price structure successfully.  Today, the 'success'for the Systemis that along with Usury, printing press money has been worked into the price structure.

            There is absolutely no real relation between price and realitygive the Devil his due, he has been tremendously successful in printing money while stalling inflation and is using that money for world conquest.  If a financial 'take down' occurs, it will be completely by design and at the time of his choosing.

            With the GOP capture of the Senate, the R dogs of war will be out in full force.  S1881 (better known as the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act) came within a few votes of passing the Senate earlier this year.  I imagine it will be taken up again next year, although Obama previously promised to veto it.  Only two R Senators didn't sign on (Jeff Flake and the much maligned Rand Paul), although many D's also supported it against Obama's wishes (it's sponsor was slimy Menendez, D-NJ), even as delicate negotiations with Tehran were commencing.   How could it not pass this time?  The leadership of both parties are putrid, but the R's, in particular, appear anxious to scuttle diplomacy and find an excuse to strike Tehran.

            Good post.  I'm no economist but I keep reading that the only thing keeping the bankrupt US Empire afloat is the US dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.  China, Russia, and the other BRICS are apparently preparing to deep-six the dollar.  If/when that happens will it become impossible for the US to maintain its world hegemony?  Anyone care to comment?

            As richard v. pointed out above, there was no debate in the recent election campaign (that i could see), about the war against IS, foreign policy, american empire, foreign bases, american interventionism, the multi-trillion dollar and growing national debt, the federal reserve propping up the entire economy,  In fact, there was no debate about issues at alljust attack ads and misrepresentions and defaming each others opponents, anti- Obama generalities, and who will take over the senate.
            <br/>
            Yet "boobus americanus" still participate in elections, hoping that this time, just getting the right guy or gal in office will turn things around.
            <br/>
            Pathetic.

            Absolutely true! Proposed "buffer zones" or "no-fly zones" on the Syrian-Turkish border and Saudi training of the Syrian "opposition" are not aimed at non-state actors like ISIS. The ruling Assad clan has been Russia's client for over 30 years. The US Dept of Energy, EIA explains what is at stake:

            "The Oil &amp; Gas Journal estimated Syria's proved reserves of oil at 2.5 billion barrels as of January 1, 2014, a total larger than all of Syria's neighbors except for Iraq.
            <br/>
            The Oil &amp; Gas Journal reported that Syria held proved reserves of 8.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas as of January 2014."

            Naturally, a stampede of recruits from Chechnya have rushed off to fight Russia's client by joining  ISIS, Al Nusra, or the FSA. For instance, this Georgian-Chechen: "The Ginger Jihadist of Mosul: Omar al-Shishani the Chechen 'General'"

            Barry Goldwater:50 Years ago.
            <br/>
            I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for
            <br/>
            I mean to reduce its size.  I do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to
            <br/>
            extend freedom.  My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them.  It is not to inaugurate
            <br/>
            new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have
            <br/>
            failed their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden.  I
            <br/>
            will not attempt to discover whether legislation is needed before I have first determined
            <br/>
            whether it is constitutionally permissible.  And if I should later be attacked for neglecting
            <br/>
            my constituents interests, I shall reply that I was informed that their main interest is
            <br/>
            liberty and that in that cause I am doing the very best I can. (end)
           </p>
           <p>
            There is the utter failure of the Conservative Movement to fulfill its promise to reduce the size and power of the federal government.  The conservatives have 50 years of excuses for this, but you  have the results in all the statistics  provided.
            <br/>
            There is the conservative illusion that we can do away with the big government Welfare State without doing away with the Warfare State.  Its not just the amount of public and private money involved, its also the power that war gives to the State.
            <br/>
            War harms the cause of liberty, and perpetual war brings liberty to an end.

            "JR continues to speak of the U. S. Government as if it was its own master, rather than the chief enforcer of Capital, which lusts to control every natural resource on the planetthough at least JR acknowledges the role of petroleum as the motive for the push to control the Caspian Basin."

            The problem is not that the government has been bought. The problem is that political power exists for sale in the first place. There is no time in history where the government wasn't a kleptocracy. There have been, however, times and places where the kleptocracy enjoyed fewer privileges because the government itself enjoyed fewer privileges. (privilege: private law, law selectively applied) Such times enjoyed increasing prosperity because absent taxes, the government-granting of monopoly privileges, and central-bank money printing, the only way to get rich was to figure out better ways of investing in the means-of-production to create more goods and services to sell (i.e. capitalism, properly defined).

            The Occupy-Wall-Street crowd rightly know the game is rigged, but they lack the first clue HOW the game is rigged. They know nothing of e.g. the fraudulent mechanics of fractional-reserve banking, and they have a blind faith in government (i.e. some imaginary notion of collective decision-making) exploited by the very 'capitalists' they despise.

            We can plainly see the positive turnaround Putin has accomplished in Russia; whether our government likes him or not is irrelevant. I don't suppose in 2016 we could elect Putin for President as a write-in candidate? We need a Putin of our own in office to be a leader, and not just another politician.

            So by knowing of an authors connection to other thinkers  decenniums earlier -, you a priori can judge if his later thinking contains any valuable information  or not?  Precisely that form of "thinking"  harmonize splendidly with the spirit of modern americans driving the whole world completely mad.  You do not have to think for yourself! No,  you just select some aspects and this "proves" you are thinking for yourself?   An easy life for a propagandist, but not worthy of a human person.

            Actually, it does not clearly reinforce that notion.
            <br/>
            Polls indicate most voters denounce both major parties as corrupt.
            <br/>
            There were NO third party candidates (much less ones offering a real alternative) in nearly every district.
            <br/>
            And so  over 60% of  the voters declined to vote !

            Is it too late anyway? If the US/Nato pulled out of the ME tomorrow, would those people stop seeking revenge for what has been done to them in Iraq, etc? If not then expect revenge on a scale that will make 9/11 look like a July 4th. backyard fireworks display.
