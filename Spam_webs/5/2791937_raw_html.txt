         Two thousand union members packed the state capitol lawn in Madison on Saturday, but attendance was a far cry from the 100,000 who marched weekly during the thick of the Wisconsin uprising in 2011.

        Over two thousand angry workers marched around the Wisconsin state capitol on a frigid Saturday afternoon February 28 to denounce Wisconsin governor and

        Scott Walkers latest round of union-busting legislation. But a bitter sense of inevitably was thick in the air.
       </p>
       <p>
        Its a bitterness to which the Left has become accustomed. And if organized labor continues to make the same mistakes they have made in Wisconsin over the last four years, the defeats will likely keep coming.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, thousands of union members packed the capitol in Madison
        <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/17698/scott_walker_right_to_work_bill" style="text-decoration: none;">
         <u>

         </u>
        </a>
        to fight a right-to-work bill that would eliminate union security clauses in collective bargaining agreements and cripple private sector labor resources and power.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill was fast-tracked with almost no debate by a Republican-dominated state senate and is now set to move through the Wisconsin state assembly this week, to be signed into law as early as Friday by a governor who has

         <u>
          tied his rising conservative political capital to his reputation as a politician willing and able to take on organized labor
         </u>
        </a>
        and win.
       </p>
       <p>
        This almost certain defeat will mark yet another serious blow to the trade union movement, encourage copycat legislation in half the country, and further elevate Walker's national profile as a serious presidential contender ahead of next year's influential Iowa Caucus. Wisconsin, once one of the densest labor strongholds in the nation, will be turned into something of a union ghost town, with no public or private sector unions of significant size. Both employers and politicians across the country will be emboldened to attack workers' rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor has nobody to blame but themselves for the carbonite they seem frozen in.

          The uprising that swept Wisconsin in the winter of 2011
         </u>
        </a>
        sparked the imagination of the nation precisely because it was a bottom-up movement of direct action. It had street heat: teacher sick-ins and walkouts, capitol occupations and mass protests. Hundreds of thousands of everyday people were inspired to join the fight.
       </p>
       <p>
        But labor made a
        <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175556/tomgram%3A_andy_kroll,_how_the_wisconsin_uprising_got_hijacked/" style="text-decoration: none;">
         <u>
          fatal mistake
         </u>
        </a>
        that it has stubbornly repeated ever since. Faced in 2011 with the option of escalating jobs actions and pushing forward to organize the much vaunted and near mythical general strike, union leadership instead made the calculated decision to
        <a href="http://socialistworker.org/2012/06/12/election-disaster-in-wisconsin" style="text-decoration: none;">
         <u>
          demobilize the protests
         </u>
        </a>
        and funnel the movement into the courts and the ballot box. Labor leaders high-jacked the electric grassroots energy and promptly drove it straight into electoral politics, where the movement continues to be stuck.
       </p>
       <p>
        Court challenges to Act 10, the 2011 law that eliminated collective bargaining and dues checkoff for public employees, failed. The recall election in 2012 and Walker's third successful election in four years in 2014 both diverted tremendous union resources away from workplace and community organizing and into campaign contributions, door knocking and phone-banking for lukewarm Democratic candidates like corporate moderates Tom Barrett and Mary Burke.
       </p>
       <p>
        The results were predictable. Absent a mobilized mass movement to elevate real candidates, or at least give the ones we appeared stuck with some backbone, Barrett and Burke refused to even talk about workers issues, played it safe and steered their campaigns straight into mediocrity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The same thing happened nationally in 2014. In response to progressives Get Out the Vote effort, the general public tuned out and corporate conservatives nearly took over. The 2012 presidential elections would have been equally bogged down if focus group pollsters had been allowed to steer the ship. The only reason 2012 was different was because the Occupy Wall Street movements brief mutiny caused enough of a ruckus to change the national conversation away from deficits and towards inequality, propelling President Obama into a second term.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rank-and-file workers I spoke with at Saturday's rally were not ignorant of any of this, and disappointment was evident in peoples voices even as most enjoyed letting off steam in collective action with like-minded union brothers and sisters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last time the movement was waylayed into Recall Walker, said Babette Grunow, an elderly woman carrying a giant General Strike banner. Now were not even in the right position to organize a general strike, she said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today's rally is a great start, but the movement isnt ready for sustained direct action, and that's what we really need to win, said David Williams, a retired AFSCME librarian. Imagine if labor had put all that time and money they dumped down the drain on elections the last four years and had used it to actually organize the working class instead, Williams continued.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Williamss point, its not hard to imagine under a different scenario labor unions turning in over

        in January 2012 in support of direct action instead of a recall election.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are still some signs for optimism, of course. Nationwide,
        <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-20/unions-poised-for-comeback-as-middle-class-wages-stall" style="text-decoration: none;">
         <u>
          labor unrest

        </a>
        is increasing and some commentators say we are on the verge of a

          new labor militancy
         </u>
        </a>
        . It was good to see thousands of workers out on the streets in Madison again. People in the crowds spoke openly about the possibility of statewide strikes, including during several conversations I listened to afterwards as people warmed up at the nearby Michelangelo's Coffee House. I saw signs and overheard folks connecting Walker's union-busting to other parts of his corporate agenda, like massive tax breaks for big business and his newest budget proposal for millions in cuts to higher education. Many people carried banners and leaflets and sang chants calling for a general strike. Some young demonstrators carried red and black flags and a giant Black Lives Matter banner was prominently placed inside the capitol rotunda.
       </p>
       <p>
        But overall, labor unions in Wisconsin and across the country are in retreat and about to take another catastrophic loss. What has happened in Wisconsin has not and will not stay inside state borders. The Republican governor in Illinois has already taken Walkers ideas to a new level, circumventing the state legislature and using
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/us/illinois-governor-bruce-rauner-acts-to-curb-power-of-public-sector-unions.html?_r=0" style="text-decoration: none;">
         <u>
          executive power
         </u>
        </a>
        to try and eliminate bargaining rights for public workers. Under the right conditions, absent a real populist movement everyday people can believe in, a conservative candidate like Scott Walker could realistically ice out a tepid Democrat like Hillary Clinton in a nationwide presidential contest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such an outcome is not inevitable. But to prevent it labor will need to start heeding the lessons of Wisconsin, and stop bringing snowballs to a gunfight.

          Karen's criticism of how the Dems handled their anti-Walker election campaigns and the need for a new leadership are accurate. Moreover there is a need for an independent labor and progressive third-party arm and labor radicals need not be against electoral work per se. Nonetheless, we must take it as a given that the corporations and plutocrats are going to be able to outspend any electoral initiatives by at least 10-1 and are going to dominate the public contest of media sound bites. Therefore labor and the left will have to base their new strategy mainly on developing direct action where the physical mobilization of People Power can outweigh the baleful influence of corporate media (for as long as  the masses were in the streets in Feb 2011 the unions and their community allies were actually out-polling Walker in Wisconsin public opinion). By the way, for a great list of 198 methods of non-violent by Gene Sharp go to
          <a href="http://www.aeinstein.org/198-methods-of-nonviolent-action-list/" rel="nofollow">
           http://www.aeinstein.org/198-m...
          </a>
          Finally, labor and the left need a on-going grassroots campaign, not to push doorbells for Democrats (which is just about the all of the community outreach that the unions periodically do) but to educate about the evils of corporate economy and corporate rule and the history, principles and forms of direct action and civil resistance in the workplaces, in the communities and in the streets. Electoral campaigns should be treated as an ADJUNCT to all this rather than a realistic strategy to defeat the American ruling class.

          It wasn't wrong to fight at the ballot box.  Scott Walker has to be replaced.  What was wrong was that the unions and the Democratic Party threw the fight.  Poor people and non-union workers (the vast majority) are suffering too, but unions had nothing to say about that.  This just supported Walker's extremely effective strategy of painting unions as unfairly privileged and selfish.  And the Dems put the worst candidates imaginable against Walker.  Burke couldn't manage one coherent sentence in the debates, and she looked 150 years old.  She and Barrett clearly had no intention of fighting for people, and no one could be excited about them.  They betrayed Wisconsin.  Wisconsin needs new political and new union leadership.  Think the Green Party and Progressive Dane.  Could it get any worse with the current clowns?

          Yeah it was the Holy Grail mantra for the AFL-CIO all during the 2008 campaign and the Dem leadership could not mount  pressure campaign to compel a few Blue-Dogs to vote for it?  It was more likely that Obama's Wall Street corporate donors didn't want it. It was patently crude betrayal, the first of many. Labor would have been far better off to have put all of those resources into educating and organizing for direct action.

          YAWN.  It would have never made it through Congress.  Landrieu, Nelson and Tester were all poised to vote against it.  The rest of your hyperbole is just that.  You missed killing Americans, btw.

          When Obama took the Employee Free Choice Act off the table in his FIRST WEEK in office as the Dems had control of both house of Congress it should have been evident to even the most myopic liberals that he is a total creature of Wall Street. Then the failure to bailout the under-water homeowbers and the massively unemployed, even as the big banks were bailed-out by all of us taxpayers. The unwillingness to seriously tax the big corporations and the plutocrats; the continued and stepped-up military spending (including a new generation of nuclear weapons!); the continued foreign military interventions and permanent "War on Terror" which only provokes more terror; consolidating and improving on Bush's "national security" police-state, etc. All of this the labor-Dems and liberals are willing to swallow as long as they get a modest piece of the big cake, i.e. Obamacare and its subsidies. That is a totally corrupt politics which fails to educate the people in any clear progressive way and is morally debilitating despite some short-term  gains. We need a new labor movement which is part of an INDEPENDENT mass resistance to this two-party corporate dictatorship, not an army of trade union cheerleaders and footsoldiers who will prop-up one faction of the ruling class and bark and jump for whatever crumbs are thrown in their direction. Even in the matter of Obamacare the national Dem leadership refused to MOBILIZE the progresive base to physically confront the Tea Patyers in 2010. Given such Dem lameness the progressive base did not turn out in the 2010 elections, and the Dems lost the US House of Representatives. In Wisconsin Walker was elected and the Republicans took control of the state legislature, thereupon gerrymandering the legislative districts to insure permanent Republican legislative control. You can absolutely thank Obama for that (and where was he during the 2011 Wisconsin Uprising?). Thus the Wisconsin Dems will forever be a minority party (eve id Hillary carries Wisconsin in 2016) in which case Wisconsin labor needs to develop an effective non-electoral direct-action strategy as part of a grassroots civil resistance to open corporate dictatorship.

          I'm sorry your organization had that experience, ours was different in Waukesha.  The leaders were invited to Washington to see the results of our efforts.  Those results provided evidence to counter the Right's smear about all these horror stories that were complete bullshit and provide cover until the website bugs were worked out.  So from a long game standpoint it has been a success.  Now that sign ups top projections and the age mixes are appropriate, insurance companies would take a kick in their revenues should the court screw with the ACA.  The Kochs don't determine SCOTUS outcomes, Roberts and the Federalist Society do.  Both are pro business and the Nabobs on the Right have nothing to offer ifinsurance companies take it in the keister.  All in all not bad work.

          After the 2008 election, many of us wanted to continue working to help the new president push his policies, and we thought that OFA was the answer.  Wrong!  They did little to help us, and we became irritated, then disgusted.  OFA would set tasks for us, such as collecting healthcare horror stories that could be used in the battle for healthcare reform.  We held meetings and collected hundreds of stories, only to have the whole project simply disappear.  This is just one example.

          1) Multiple reports stated there were 5000+ people there that Saturday.  It's not as if 100,000 people showed up at the Capitol the first day.
         </p>
         <p>
          2) Since Act 10, there actually are public sector locals that have close to 100% membership signing up with their unions.  In addition, private sector unions have been educating and organizing their members for years.  We shall see if WI becomes a labor union ghost town...
         </p>
         <p>
          3) In 2011, the people shouted 'recall Walker' in HUGE numbers.  It was at the grassroots level where this decision was made.  The people came up with a villain, they wanted vengeance, and they moved forward with this REGARDLESS what the 'unions' wanted.  In fact, it was the people who decided to move forward with a recall effort right away when the union strategists wanted to wait, at least until the Presidential (when turnout would be higher).  But alas, the calls for a general strike did not resonate with the people.  And the few workers and teachers who went on strike were primarily from Madison where their employers were sympathetic and supportive of the cause.
         </p>
         <p>
          4) Also, Union leadership has been educating and organizing their members.  They just don't advertise it, but if you ask them, they would sit down with you have that conversation.
         </p>
         <p>
          5)  The court challenges did not merely 'fail'.  They allowed the locals time to use their resources to organize the membership.   Same goes with a number of other things the unions did.  There are always multiple reasons for doing things, but the unions are not going to publicize them because than the 'bad guys' will find out.
         </p>
         <p>
          6) The moderate dem (Barrett) was not the first choice of the unions, but that is who won the primary.  Why?  Because Wisconsin voted that way.  And there was a more progressive candidate, but she received VERY FEW votes.  With that said, the unions have supported VERY progressive candidates at the state and national level.  We lose some, we win some.  Finally, there is a REAL PLAN in effect that interconnects the electoral at a LOCAL level with organizing efforts and not compromising workplace actions.
         </p>
         <p>
          7)  Many unions have been investing in workplace and community organizing. There are plenty of examples of this IF only someone would ask them what they have been doing.  They have also built coalitions, used the leverage that they have, and continue to evolve.
         </p>
         <p>
          8) In regards to the 2 individuals quoted: good people, but have they been able to organize the construction and factory workers to agree with them and go on strike?  Apparently not. Why?  Because although it's fashionable to critique in this manner, the real Union organizers HAVE BEEN educating the members about RTW.  Many of those workers did not believe it was coming--and if they don't believe it, then it's pretty difficult to just skip the educational stage and go straight to direct action.  Go interview the organizers and ask them what stage they are at with the workers.  It's an arduous, epistemic journey.
         </p>
         <p>
          9)   Singing songs does not equate to militancy, but I get the point.  Trades unionists will take action, and when it happens, it will be strategic and must hurt the enemy where it counts:  their pocketbooks.  But those unionists won't talk about it, nor will they tell just anyone what they have done in the past.  It's called building trust and listening to those workers who don't try to get into the limelight. None of the undercover, hardcore, blue collar activists were quoted for this article...
         </p>
         <p>
          10) With that said, of course resources need to shift, more needs to be done, and regular working people need to get engaged and rise up and stay committed.  But that is not just local union leadership's fault, because as we know, the leadership usually comes from the membership itself.
         </p>
         <p>
          11)  We will get there.  And when we do, the fightback will be militant and bad-ass.  Just don't think that there's not a lot more going on then meets the eye at a rally against the inevitable...

          Organizing for America originally Obama for America. It is a grass roots organization that augmented union activities to organize voters.  There is one near you where ever you are.  Whether or not you feel they operate on a "strategy centered on elections (a bad idea in a money- and media-driven electoralarena dominated by the corporations and plutocrats) such a movement
          <br/>

But the midterms were a different story.  It will be around in 2016 as I think the Clinton camp will follow your former criticism of which I agree.  This is our local office:

          For those of us not not initiated into labor Dem politics please explain
          <br/>
          OFA.  My own experience in Wisconsin is that most progressives (and not
          <br/>
          Dem-Party apologists) up here agree that the Barrett and Burke
          <br/>
          campaigns seriously watered-down pro-labor pronouncements. The labor
          <br/>
          movement and its community allies have neutered themselves by throwing
          <br/>
          most of their resources into campaigning for corporate Dems who
          <br/>
          water-down a progressive message. Better all of that time and money had
          <br/>
          gone into building a grassroots organization (independent of the
          <br/>
          corporate-controlled Democratic Party) which could educate around a
          <br/>
          clear and strong anti-corporate message. And instead of a strategy
          <br/>
          centered on elections (a bad idea in a money- and media-driven electoral
          <br/>
          arena dominated by the corporations and plutocrats) such a movement
          <br/>
          should educate about the history, principles and forms of direct action
          <br/>
          and civil resistance in the workplaces, in the communities and in the

          Placing the blame squarely on labor is a bit overwrought.  The idea that Unions had to organize a mass movement when an organization was in place to do that (OFA) smacks of replacing a dependable tire with a retread. "Absent a mobilized mass movement to elevate real candidates, or at least give the ones we appeared stuck with some backbone, Barrett and Burke refused to even talk about workers issues, played it safe and steered their campaigns straight into mediocrity."  Bullshit.  Organized labor pushed both and Burke was quite vocal about worker's rights.  If there was a failure to conjoin the two, it was Burke's campaign.  Rule violation?  Scooter got away with it, so far.
