Its assets include career colleges Everest, Heald and Wyotech. As my previous post --&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=\"Corinthian Colleges Fraudulently Targeted Jerry Springer Viewers\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2014/07/31/california-ag-corinthian-colleges-fraudulently-targeted-jerry-springer-set/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;California AG: Corinthian Colleges Fraudulently Targeted Jerry Springer Set&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;--&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;made clear, these assets are being officially wound down from Corinthian&rsquo;s control at the behest of the Department of Education and under the guidance of famed federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, history in the for-profit education space suggests that at least some of Corinthian&rsquo;s assets could be reconstituted under another name. In other words, this controversial publicly traded for-profit education company (&lt;a title=\"Corinthian Colleges Yahoo Finance\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COCO\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NASDAQ:COCO&lt;/a&gt;) &ndash;- like others before it -- might die another day.\r\n\r\nFor starters, Corinthian&rsquo;s 14-college Ontario, Canada division is considering offers by various suitors. &lt;a href=\"http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/everest-college-s-parent-company-looks-to-sell-ontario-campuses-1.1920738#ixzz382uefw00\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;According to Everest Colleges Canada president Rupert Altschuler&lt;/a&gt;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;business as usual,&rdquo; despite Corinthian&rsquo;s announcement that it will sell its Canadian campuses.\r\n\r\n\"The entire plan is to sell the Canadian division as an ongoing enterprise,&rdquo; said Altschuler. &ldquo;We are still accepting new students, of course, and we continue to teach all the existing students.\" Altschuler said that many stakeholders have already expressed &ldquo;healthy interest&rdquo; in the Canadian division.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"zemanta-img\"&gt;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"]&lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37171504@N00/5105071123\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Everest College Sign\" alt=\"Everest College Sign\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jamesmarshallcrotty/files/2014/08/5105071123_1a941cb86e_b1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Everest College Sign (Photo credit: compujeramey)[/caption]\r\n\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\nIndeed, it&rsquo;s distinctly possible that Everest will live on in Canada. The same could be true of other Corinthian brands. That is, the owners and even names could change, but the questionable practices -- including falsifying job placement data and predatory marketing efforts -- could remain the same. As Atschuler noted to CTV News Toronto, \"At some miraculous point of time, there will just be a change of ownership. But when it comes to the day-to-day operations, it will have no impact whatsoever.&rdquo; Hmmm.\r\n\r\nHowever, there&rsquo;s a bigger element at play here.&nbsp; As the wind-down of Corinthian Colleges continues apace -- with a gradual \"teach-out\" that enables current students to complete their degrees -- it&rsquo;s important to remember the company&rsquo;s founding DNA. Corinthian Colleges, International (CCI) was created in 1995 by five former executives at National Education Centers, Inc. (NECI). These executives built CCI by purchasing a series of struggling vocational schools, such as the American Motorcycle Institute and Bryman College (which continued to have legal problems under CCI and despite a name change to Everest College).&nbsp; In other words, with so much U.S. government loan and grant money at stake, it&rsquo;s distinctly possible that Corinthian Colleges and a chunk of its personnel may simply reconstitute under a different name and in a different locale, thereby wiping the slate clean of the allegations against it.\r\n\r\nGiven the Obama administration&rsquo;s push for &lt;a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/college-graduate-rank-falls-obama-touts\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&ldquo;college education for all,&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; especially for those in &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2014/07/31/california-ag-corinthian-colleges-fraudulently-targeted-jerry-springer-set/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the Jerry Springer demographic&lt;/a&gt;, don&rsquo;t be surprised if several troubled for-profits reconstitute themselves as &lt;a title=\"chameleon carriers\" href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000297213\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&ldquo;chameleon carriers&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; of education to capitalize on aggressive government intervention in the college marketplace. In other words, rather than representing a fundamental sea change in for-profit education, CCI may simply be the Lehman-like poster boy that allows business to continue as usual.\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;That&rsquo;s my take. Let me know what you think in the Comments area below.&lt;/em&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/CROTTY\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@CROTTY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;","text":null,"description":"History in the for-profit education space suggests that at least some of Corinthian Colleges' assets could be reconstituted under another name without a fundamental change in how it does business.

Its assets include career colleges Everest, Heald and Wyotech. As my previous post &nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=\"Corinthian Colleges Fraudulently Targeted Jerry Springer Viewers\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2014/07/31/california-ag-corinthian-colleges-fraudulently-targeted-jerry-springer-set/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;California AG: Corinthian Colleges Fraudulently Targeted Jerry Springer Set&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;made clear, these assets are being officially wound down from Corinthians control at the behest of the Department of Education and under the guidance of famed federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, history in the for-profit education space suggests that at least some of Corinthians assets could be reconstituted under another name. In other words, this controversial publicly traded for-profit education company (&lt;a title=\"Corinthian Colleges Yahoo Finance\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=COCO\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;NASDAQ:COCO&lt;/a&gt;) - like others before it  might die another day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, Corinthians 14-college Ontario, Canada division is considering offers by various suitors. &lt;a href=\"http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/everest-college-s-parent-company-looks-to-sell-ontario-campuses-1.1920738#ixzz382uefw00\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;According to Everest Colleges Canada president Rupert Altschuler&lt;/a&gt;, its business as usual, despite Corinthians announcement that it will sell its Canadian campuses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The entire plan is to sell the Canadian division as an ongoing enterprise, said Altschuler. We are still accepting new students, of course, and we continue to teach all the existing students. Altschuler said that many stakeholders have already expressed healthy interest in the Canadian division.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"zemanta-img\"&gt; \n &lt;div&gt; \n  &lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37171504@N00/5105071123\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Everest College Sign\" alt=\"Everest College Sign\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jamesmarshallcrotty/files/2014/08/5105071123_1a941cb86e_b1.jpg\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;p class=\"wp-caption-text\"&gt;Everest College Sign (Photo credit: compujeramey)&lt;/p&gt; \n &lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, its distinctly possible that Everest will live on in Canada. The same could be true of other Corinthian brands. That is, the owners and even names could change, but the questionable practices  including falsifying job placement data and predatory marketing efforts  could remain the same. As Atschuler noted to CTV News Toronto, At some miraculous point of time, there will just be a change of ownership. But when it comes to the day-to-day operations, it will have no impact whatsoever. Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, theres a bigger element at play here.&nbsp; As the wind-down of Corinthian Colleges continues apace  with a gradual teach-out that enables current students to complete their degrees  its important to remember the companys founding DNA. Corinthian Colleges, International (CCI) was created in 1995 by five former executives at National Education Centers, Inc. (NECI). These executives built CCI by purchasing a series of struggling vocational schools, such as the American Motorcycle Institute and Bryman College (which continued to have legal problems under CCI and despite a name change to Everest College).&nbsp; In other words, with so much U.S. government loan and grant money at stake, its distinctly possible that Corinthian Colleges and a chunk of its personnel may simply reconstitute under a different name and in a different locale, thereby wiping the slate clean of the allegations against it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the Obama administrations push for &lt;a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/college-graduate-rank-falls-obama-touts\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;college education for all,&lt;/a&gt; especially for those in &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/2014/07/31/california-ag-corinthian-colleges-fraudulently-targeted-jerry-springer-set/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;the Jerry Springer demographic&lt;/a&gt;, dont be surprised if several troubled for-profits reconstitute themselves as &lt;a title=\"chameleon carriers\" href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000297213\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;chameleon carriers&lt;/a&gt; of education to capitalize on aggressive government intervention in the college marketplace. In other words, rather than representing a fundamental sea change in for-profit education, CCI may simply be the Lehman-like poster boy that allows business to continue as usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thats my take. Let me know what you think in the Comments area below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/CROTTY\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@CROTTY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"],"brandsToFilter":null,"galleryId":null,"removePaywall":null,"disableDigest":null,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":null,"url":"/leadership","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_6section_37","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Careers","url":"/careers","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_6section_92","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Education","url":"/education","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null}],"individualAuthor":{"id":null,"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/104184","name":"James Marshall Crotty","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1422baeddfc1283490fcac15b870ac58?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1422baeddfc1283490fcac15b870ac58?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1422baeddfc1283490fcac15b870ac58?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1422baeddfc1283490fcac15b870ac58?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"contents":null,"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmarshallcrotty/","channelSectionMappings":null,"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/people/jamesmarshallcrotty/","twitterName":"Crotty","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"JamesMarshallCrotty","linkedIn":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescrotty","email":"jim@monk.com","tagName":null,"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"bio":null,"shortBio":"I cover education as a sector and as the bedrock of all sectors.","amazon":"http://www.amazon.com/Crottys-Kids-James-Crotty/dp/B00LIB013G","webSite":"http://www.jamescrotty.com","advoiceBrand":null,"timestamp":1436657992478,"description":"Ive written about myself and America for nearly three decades and through variousmedia incarnations, from Frommers to Playboy to now Forbes.
