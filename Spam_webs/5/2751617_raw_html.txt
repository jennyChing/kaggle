           How to Lose Weight and Get Fit as a Teenager...
          </strong>
          <p>
           Technology can boost your fitness in a number of ways. With online groups and apps to help you, you can be on your journey to a better overall wellbeing in a matter of mouse clicks. However, for 12-year experienced Certified
           <a href="http://wgnradio.com/2014/02/07/personal-trainer-joe-martinez/" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="Personal Trainer Joe Martinez | WGN Radio  720 AM">
            Personal Trainer
           </a>
           Yarixa Ferrao, NASM, CPR/AED, technology is actually hampering teenage wellness. She notes, With all this technology, kids and teens are losing connection with their bodies and have become more sedentary because of it. And when they start seeing themselves gain weight they may attempt joining the gym or just continue to gain it because they have no idea what to do. Plus, in the gym, unless they have a personal trainer theres no one there to instruct them and they end up doing what their friends do. In the end, they spend hours on the treadmill, which will amount to not a whole lot of progress.



Therefore, Ferrao has created a workout routine especially for teenagers. Ferrao explains, I know the importance of building a solid body foundation, especially as a developing teen. This is also a time to build self confidence, be mentally focused, reduce stress (teenage years can be stressful with all the expectations from parents and teachers while finding your own voice) and enjoy these years to the fullest, instead of worrying about appearance and lacking self esteem. I worked with three teens for a show on MTV called
           <i>
            I Used to Be Fat
           </i>
           in which the kids were desperate to lose weight, feel great, and lead a happier life. The result: They lost a lot of weight, got stronger, and gained self confidence! They also were able to experience a completely different life and a different perspective, from very down and negative, to up, open, and positive.



Ferrao recommends focusing on the core, combining bodyweight movements (styles such as yoga, functional training, Pilates, animalistic movements, Karate), and locomotion (or running, hiking, biking, sprinting and walking). She provides the following workout routine (once youve got the OK from your doctor and have done five to 10 minutes warming up, of course):
           <b>
            1. Cardio:
           </b>
           Ferrao instructs, Instead of just doing hours on end on the treadmill, do short burst of sprints (run as fast as you can). Warm-up first for five minutes or until you feel the body get a bit sweaty. Then increase the speed to go as fast as you are able to for 20 seconds. Take a 20 second break and then repeat your 20 second sprint. Do this for six minutes and up to 12 minutes, allowing your rest periods to be longer if you need extra time to be able to perform the full 20 second sprint. Preferably do it outside. The treadmill is the next best choice.
           <b>
            2. Work on that core:
           </b>
           To increase your metabolism, gain muscular endurance and a stronger core, dont just go out and run miles and miles and then do a ton of crunches, Ferrao urges. This wont help much unless cross country is your sport. Instead, once you finish your warm-up and sprinting, do the following routine:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            12-15 squats with a pair of dumbbells or just body weight if you are a beginner.
           </li>
           <li>
            15 push-ups or modified push-ups.
           </li>
           <li>
            20 reverse lunges, 10 with the right leg and 10 with the left one.
           </li>
           <li>
            Plank  hold for 30 seconds.
           </li>
           <li>
            12-15 jumping pull-ups.
           </li>
           <li>
            12-15 squat to presses using dumbbells about six to eight pounds for girls and 12 to 15 pounds for boys.
           </li>
           <li>
            Side plank  hold 30 seconds.
           </li>
           <li>
            Five burpees.
           </li>
          </ul>
          Repeat for 3 or 4 rounds! Take 1.5 minute-rest between each set. Pause at any point if you feel dizzy or faint.

           How to Help Your Children Fight Obesity and S...
          </strong>
          <p>
           All kids have a bit of puppy fat, but, as parents, you can tell when your childs weight becomes a cause for concern for their wellbeing. If your childs wellness is affected by shortness of breath, inability to concentrate, depression, and/or emotional eating, it may be necessary to talk to your child about their weight and visit the doctor. Bringing up the topic of weight with your overweight child can be difficult, so here are a few guidelines to help shape the conversation.
           <b>
            1. Fix your own health challenges:
           </b>
           We could all use a little boost to our diet and exercise regime, unless youre an Olympian or something, so set an example for your child. Whether seeing you take control of your own wellness inspires your child to make a few of their own, or forces them to ask you why youre doing it, you can be the change you want to see in your kid. If nothing else, it will start a dialogue and show your child that you know how it feels to change your lifestyle.
           <b>
            2. Encourage athletics:
           </b>
           Participating in sports, whether at school or an after-school club, helps kids to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and have fun at the same time. Doing sport also bolsters self-esteem, which is crucial to your childs weight loss efforts as well as their overall sense of wellbeing. If your child is too heavy to participate in competitions, or is worried about joining a team of much healthier classmates, why not start doing activities as a family until your childs confidence is stronger.
           <b>
            3. Dont be blunt about weight loss:
           </b>
           When talking about your childs wellness, say "get healthier," not "lose weight." Children and teenagers dont need tough words; theyre aware of their sizes. Your focus should be on helping your child reach a healthier BMI, rather than some vague ideal weight goal. The difference is in building muscle and making healthier food choice, not just cutting calories and making the number on the scale go down. Your child shouldnt be aiming for a certain look; he or she should be after a certain health level and feeling.
           <b>
            4. Keep unhelpful concerns to yourself:
           </b>
           We all know that kids can be cruel, and so you may be concerned that your
           <a href="http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/archive_articles/131023_uebergewichtige_kinder_fs/index_EN" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="Every fifth child is overweight - ETH Life - ETH Zrich">
            overweight child
           </a>
           wont be socially accepted, especially if you have a daughter. However, despite these valid concerns, they arent the best motivators for weight loss and can wreak havoc on your childs self-esteem. Your child needs to lose weight for herself or himself, not for the acceptance of other people or you.
           <b>
            5. Reward
            <a href="http://watchdogreporters.net/risky-behaviours-constitute-growing-threats-to-global-health-policy-interventions-can-turn-the-tide-says-world-bank-report/" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="Risky Behaviours Constitute Growing Threats to Global Health ...">
             healthy behaviours
            </a>
            :
           </b>
           Adding a little light at the end of the tunnel can motivate your child to keep going. Offer to reward healthy behaviours, such as eating two portions of vegetables at dinner or exercising regularly. Its important to emphasise the healthy behaviours themselves, rather than the outcomes  the actual number of pounds lost will take care of itself once your child has those healthy habits in place. The vague goal of "losing weight" is rarely helpful for obese or overweight young people; you need a specific system of mini goals and rewards.
           <b>
            6. Get to the root of the problem:
           </b>
           Theres a tremendous amount of pressure on young people  both girls and boys  to look thin, so if your child is severely overweight then theres likely an emotional cause. There may be pain for your child to get through, a self-worth issue to work out, or a habit of eating to relieve stress. Again, dont focus on the weight itself but what is causing the excess eating and lack of self-love. Journaling, regular conversations, and healthy social outlets can help your child come to terms with the cause of the problem.

           If youve gained weight as a secondary school student or since youve gone to college, there are many ways to change your lifestyle to see great weight loss results. To begin with, exercise is hugely important and doesnt feature very prominently in most teens schedules. There are so many benefits though, not just to your weight - youll have an improved sense of wellbeing, lower risk of diabetes and stroke, and better cardiovascular health. Most people dread the thought of working up a sweat and building their heart rate up, but the benefits are so huge. Exercise can be as intense or slow paced as you want, depending on what you choose, but as long as youre moving and your heart rate has quickened, anything goes - from jogging around the block to dancing in your living room! The best way to motivate yourself is to make your workout fun, so try different things out to see what you like. You can also make changes to your everyday routine such as using the stairs instead of the lift or walking to work and college. Get a friend involved and youll not only enjoy it more but youll also stay motivated to keep it up.

           Where your diet is concerned, the best tip you can follow is to not go on a diet - in other words, diets that are designed to offer quick results usually fail. The best way to lose weight and be healthy at the same time is to simply cut down on the fatty and sugary foods, and replace them with healthy, homemade alternatives. Teens are notorious for eating fast food and unhealthy snacks, but these make it so much easier to gain weight. You are what you eat, so make your meals healthy and nutritious. Opt for healthy snacks such as homemade popcorn, yoghurt, pretzels and granola bars. Fruit and vegetables are also fantastic snack foods, offering a healthy boost of energy. Replace all of those cans of fizzy drink with water or the occasional glass of fruit juice, to give your body the hydration it needs without a constant supply of sugar. The body also needs protein, so make sure you get plenty of meat and dairy products, as well as peanut butter and legumes.

          If youre going out with friends, you dont need to feel as though you cant join in, but simply act in moderation. If youre getting a pizza, try not to eat the whole thing - share with a friend or just eat a few slices and stop when youre full. At the cinema, opt for the freshly made popcorn instead of the branded types that are laden with toffee. And you can treat yourself to an ice cream at the beach, just limit those visits to once a month rather than every week. Weight loss and a healthier lifestyle is simply about willpower, balance and forward-planning - once you have that covered, its easier than you think. If you're unsure how to go about it, gather a great support group in the form of your family and friends who will ensure you

Your GP can offer advice if you're not sure how to go about changing your lifestyle - if you're new to exercise and are making drastic diet changes, it may be useful to run it by them to make sure it's safe.

           </a>
           in general. Even as mainstream culture becomes more accepting of motorcycling as a primary means of travel, many people still dismiss bikers as rough hooligans who are looking for trouble or have just gotten out of jail. However, motorcycle riding can be anything but troublesome if you approach it with the right amount of respect and anticipation. In fact, motorcycle riding can be quite beneficial to your health in several important ways.
           <strong>
            Motorcycle Riding Provides Mental Stimulation
           </strong>
           Riding a motorcycle is quite different than driving a car. When you drive a car, you generally do not have to exert too much thought about your actions unless you are in heavy traffic or traveling around curved roads. You may be like many people and simply use the cruise control while you are driving. However, riding a motorcycle requires mental effort to control your ride. You must be ready to weave in and out of traffic as needed and always think ahead to make sure you control your cycle safely.

           lawyer states, "motorcycles are both fun and practical, and many people enjoy using motorbikes for commuting or simply for the pleasure of the ride.'' Along with being stimulated mentally, you also can be challenged physically when you ride your cycle. Motorcycles are quite heavy, even though they look small and compact. As you control the handlebars, shift the gears, and manipulate other components of the bike, you may find that your arms, legs, and torso are worked out quite extensively.

            Motorcycle Riding Provides Social Interactions
           </strong>
           Bikers everywhere form a unique brotherhood that welcomes fellow riders often without question or hesitation. Even if a person starts out riding alone, he or she may easily find new friends as that person starts attending cycle shows or meets other bikers out on the road. Bikers typically form fast friendships that last a lifetime and are more supportive than mainstream friendships formed at school or work.

            Motorcycle Riding Relieves Stress and Depression
           </strong>
           Many cyclists report being in vastly better moods once they climb on their cycles and take to the road. When bikers head out on the open road, they are capable of finding relief from their everyday worries and stresses and even experience relief from depression and fatigue. Their moods are elevated because they feel free and at ease on the open road.

            Motorcycle Riding Requires that You Take Care of Your Safety
           </strong>
           If you have always been someone who neglected your personal safety, cycling can help you become more concerned with your physical wellness. When you are out on your bike, you must pay attention to avoid crashes and becoming injured. As you learn to take care of yourself, you can learn to appreciate your own wellness and the need for you to remain safe at all times. Many cyclists experience a boost in confidence and self-awareness after they take up motorcycle riding.
           <em>
            Motorcycling is anything but the deviant hobby that the public may readily dismiss it as. You can improve your mental and physical health in several important ways when you take up riding a motorcycle.

           Vanquish: The New Fat Loss Device Everyone...
          </strong>
          <p>
           We all have that fantasy  apart from that one about Ryan Gosling  to lose weight and have better wellness minus the effort of dieting, exercise or surgery. While this seems like nothing more than a pipe dream, your effort-free, weight loss wellbeing may me just around the corner, thanks to a revolutionary treatment called Vanquish that even usually sceptical doctors are excited about.



According to David McDaniel, a leading researcher and an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School, who has been conducting an independent study on Vanquish, I've seen a lot of fat-removal techniques; some procedures are painful or take too long; some are effective only on small areas of body fat that can be sucked up through a small vacuum. Vanquish addresses all those problems. It can treat a large surface area uniformly. It's fast, efficient, and comfortableI've been doing this for 30 years, and most advances have been little baby steps. This is a big technological breakthrough.



The treatment, which will becomeusableby an elite corps of doctor's offices this month, targets your fat cells through
           <a href="http://truthfrequencyradio.com/roseanne-barr-im-never-going-to-work-in-television-again/" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="Roseanne Barr: I'm Never Going to Work in Television Again ...">
            radio frequency
           </a>
           waves which heat the cells and kill them off without damaging your muscles or skin. As the applicator is suspended over your abdomen about an inch above your skin, Vanquish is non-invasive, and theres no downtime or ridiculous price tag. In the US, a 30-minute session goes for $450 (282) to $800 (501), and its recommended that you have four sessions. During these sessions, you may feel a warming sensation, but there should be no pain. The only risk to watch out for is a hot spot near to a bone, which your technician can readjust and fix without a problem.



The FDA approved Vanquish earlier this year for deep-tissue heating, which can help your muscles to recover and heal. However, the FDA is awaiting further results before giving the device the seal of approval for fat reduction. Still, the current research is impressive; animal studies have shown that Vanquish killed 60% of the fat cells treated with it, and a subsequent Prague study done on people with love handles showed visible results within two weeks, revealing an average loss in waist circumference of 2.23 inches after two months. Robert Weiss, an associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the lead researcher of the aforementioned animal study, notes, This new technique is a real game changerit's the safest, easiest way yet to remove fat.



As the panels heat up, the radio

           they transmit differentiate between fat cells (which are denser and hold less water) and skin and muscle cells, Weiss explains. The heat causes cell death in the fat cells; some die instantly, some in a matter of weeksI've seen patients lose several inches after four treatments without changing their diets. McDaniel continues, The results are not as dramatic as liposuction, which can remove large volumes of fat, adding that Vanquish does not carry the risks of surgery or anaesthesia. However, Adam Kolker, a plastic surgeon and an associate clinical professor of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital's Icahn School of Medicine in New York, asserts, I've seen a lot of people who've undergone various non-surgical fat-reduction treatments who were underwhelmed with the results.



Still, Kolker allows, It may be appropriate for small-scale changes as long as the patient's expectations are well managed. Nonetheless, Patricia Wexler, a dermatologist to New York's A-list, believes that expectations will be high for the procedure. She points out, It's great for women who are in good shape, within 5 to 10% of their ideal weight, and don't want to go through surgery. A lot of women exercise and don't have a lot of weight to lose, but they've had children or seen changes in their core for other reasons.

           Obesity: Can a Microchip be the Answer?...
          </strong>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.yourwellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/obesity-micro-chip.jpg">
           </a>
           With obesity rates rising, doctors have been scratching their heads over the best  and safest way  to combat the disorder that seems to claim so many. Around the corner however, a new and mercifully-inexpensive augmentation may be key to curbing misbehaving appetites.

You may be used to science fiction telling you the wonders (or the dilemmas) of microchips, but a small (smaller-than-the-tip-of-your-finger small!) one attached to your nerve may be key to quelling your need to over-eat.

"This is a really small microchip and on this chip we've got the intelligence which can actually model the neural signals responsible for appetite control," Chris Toumazou, professor at Imperial College London and one of the inventors of the chip, told the BBC.

The microchip would be attached to your vagus nerve  this is the nerve that controls your desire to eat, digest, heart rate and more. It's a very extensive range. In hindsight, Toumazou explained that the project was originally designed for children suffering from disorders such as cerebral palsy and epileptic seizures. The microchip in this case, used a piece of technology called MIMATE, which reads chemical signatures in the brain.

Taking that very same technology, the microchip was then developed into something that could be beneficial for weight loss. What changed about the weight-loss microchip was that the chip didn't send stimulating impulses, but rather submits readings and signals to suppress the urge to eat.

"As a result of monitoring these signals we can stimulate the brain to counter whatever we monitor," Toumazou said. "It will be control of appetite rather than saying don't eat completely. So maybe instead of eating fast you'll eat a lot slower."

That's right  whether you know it or not, your body would be telling your brain off for eating more than you should!

Creepy or creative? Inspiring or frightening?

The microchip is still in development, but for many suffering from obesity, it may be the next best thing.

           A Balanced and Healthy Diet Doesnt Have to...
          </strong>
          <p>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Your diet and nutrition are key components to your ongoing wellness and wellbeing. Your daily diet should be nourishing and well balanced if you want to live a long and healthy life. After a while, however, it can become boring to eat salad, grilled chicken, steamed vegetables and all the other things in your healthy list. Boredom is a really dangerous thing when it comes to healthy eating, because as soon as boredom sets in, the allure of takeaways, convenience foods and junk snacks starts to kick in. To avoid this, make sure that you stay away from bland food; healthy food doesnt have to be boring and in fact can be exciting and packed full of flavour.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            One of the best things to do is to experiment with using new and exotic fresh herbs and spices. Dont use the same old familiar seasonings in everything you cook! Purchase some of the less-common spices and give them a try. You could roast your veggies with curry powder, for example, or add it to stews and soups. Herbs de Provence can be a great addition when rubbed onto meats and fish or used to flavour sauces or marinades. Star anise when combined with grated ginger and cinnamon can make a beautiful poached chicken.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Tofu is always worth trying, too. Although it has a bad reputation, tofu is a very lean form of protein. It doesnt taste like much on its own but it takes on the flavour of anything you cook with. Use extra-firm and firm tofu to make stir fries, casseroles, soups etc.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            You could also liven up your menu by whipping up some great new sauces, or using a low-fat bottled sauce that you havent tried before.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            You can also jazz up salads with the addition of a homemade dressing.

            Its good news for chocolate addicts everywhere: eating chocolate could be good for your wellness! Recent research has found that those who include chocolate or cocoa as part of their diet and nutrition actually had improved wellbeing in many different ways.

            indeed. As high blood pressure is a leading cause of stroke and heart disease, this is a very positive thing and reflects well on the beneficial effects of cocoa.

           <span style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
            Chocolate is made from cocoa, and is a sweetened form of the food. Dark chocolate in particular is thought to be a great source of antioxidants, zinc, iron, manganese, magnesium and phosphorous. As well as blood pressures studies (which need further work to be conclusive) many other health benefits have been claimed regarding chocolate.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
            Some studies have shown, for example, that a diet rich in cocoa could help to protect the body against bowel cancer. Again, the research done in this area is very patchy, and further work would need to be done to prove that chocolate can have a strongly beneficial effect.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
            A study was also conducted into the effects of chocolate on stress levels. Whilst the study, which involved 30 healthy people being given 40g of dark chocolate each day for two weeks, seemed to show a reduction in their stress levels, critics have argued that the fact that it was carried out by a major chocolate manufacturer has made it biased, and that the results cannot be trusted.

           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            <em>
             A well-known British money saving website has recently uncovered that as many as two thirds of people in this country put on more weight between June and September than they do at any other point of the year. It is believed that the main cause behind this is the excessive calorie intake at barbeques.
            </em>
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            Leading UK money saving website VoucherCodesPro has recently conducted a survey that demonstrated that 67% of British people gain more weight between the months of June and September, the summer months, than at any other point during the year. While it was expected that the festive season would show a big increase in weight, this turned out to be incorrect. The research also demonstrated that people at around 1,000 calories at a barbeque than at any other regular meal.

            </a>
            study involved some 2,196 British people. Each of them were over the age of 18 and current residents of the United Kingdom. The questions asked were meant to determine what overall eating habits were and whether there was a link to overall health as well.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            In the first question, the survey aimed to determine whether people were aware of any periods during the year where they would often put weight on. The expectation was that people would choose the festive season, but, surprisingly, 67% actually pointed to the summer months of June to September.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            Those who said that they did indeed put on weight were then asked what they believed the cause of this was. The results were as follows:
           </span>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             52% felt that eating at too many barbeques was behind their weight gain.
            </span>
           </li>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             34% felt that excessive alcohol consumptions, and particularly cider and cocktails, was to blame for their weight gain.
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           VoucherCodesPro also wanted to look into the changes in summer eating habits for the average person. Respondents were first asked how many calories they would consume during a regular meal, which averaged at 650 calories. They were then asked how many calories they estimated to consume during a barbeque, which was 1,775, more than 1,000 calories above the average plate of food.
          </span>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           The survey then tried to determine exactly what people actually ate during barbeques. This was in part because they wanted to see whether people would stick to just one meal. What was found instead was that most people ate what can best be compared to a mixed grill:
          </span>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             63% eat hotdogs
            </span>

           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             59% eat cheeseburgers
            </span>
           </li>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             54% eat chicken wings
            </span>
           </li>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             48% eat crisps and dips
            </span>
           </li>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             44% eat kebabs
            </span>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           Worryingly, and of the slightly healthier suggestions, such as side salads, corn on the cob or baked potatoes, did not make it anywhere near the top 5. It could be that this is one of the reasons why weight gain and calorific intake during this time period is higher than during the festive season, when vegetables are common on the menu, even if calorie intake is still high as well.
          </span>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           According to Nick Swan, the project manager for VoucherCodesPros study on the eating habits of the British public:
          </span>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           "Ill admit, Im a sucker for a good barbecue. From hot dogs to cheeseburgers, traditional BBQ cuisine is one of the UKs favourite summertime treats  and who can blame us!
          </span>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           Furthermore, he stated that

          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           It is important, however, to ensure that you exercise regularly and keep yourself active to avoid putting on extra weight during summer. BBQ foods arent exactly the healthiest, so people need to make sure that they keep themselves fit and have some salad on their plate along with all the burgers and sausages!

            Reducing your weight and getting your fitness back without having to go to the gym  it sound ideal, doesnt it? Well, this fantasy could actually be a reality, as we have compiled a great list of easy things that you can do to help bring back your physical wellness and wellbeing without having to put yourself through the exertion and boredom of another session on the treadmill down at the gym. The ways that we have found help to burn calories and when incorporated into your daily routine, should start leading to a slimmer, trimmer you.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            One of the best forms of exercise is dance. When you are dancing you often dont realise that you are even burning any calories at all. Invite some friends round, and have a little dance party. Not only will this be great fun and cause plenty of laughs with you and your friends, but you will find that the active moving around helps you to sweat those pounds off in no time.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Sex is also a great way to get exercise. An hour of foreplay and vigorous sex can burn over 100 calories at a time, and can of course be great fun, too. Sexercise, as it is often playfully referred to, can be great for toning too, depending on how adventurous you get.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            If interior design is more your thing, shifting furniture around in your living room for 30 minutes can burn literally dozens of calories at a time. You could even add a lick of paint to the walls  rolling on a new coat of paint burns around 204 calories every hour  so give it an extra coat or two! If youre more of a pub crawler, then head down to your local and play a game of darts. Even this simple game gets you moving around and burning off calories.

           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            If you are looking to reduce your weight and increase your fitness, there are some great and very simple moves that you can incorporate into your workout to make things easier and to tone up in record time.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Doing some simple toning moves every day can help you to tighten up all over, and get a body that is ready for bikini season. These moves are fun and varied, and best of all boost your wellness and wellbeing without needing to resort to any expensive equipment. That means that you can do these moves regardless of where you are  be that in the office or even when you are travelling.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            The first one is nicknamed the bikini dance  and you start by kneeling on the mat with your knees around hip-width apart. You should sit up as tall as you can, with your hands on your hips and then start swaying your hips from side to side. This exercise targets your abs, obliques and quads. Repeat this exercise over and over again for around one minute and then do it again for a further minute with your arms raised above your head.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Next, try the flying seagull move. Start in the yoga childs post with your shins on the mat and your chest hovering around above your quads. Spread your arms out to the sides and then lift your elbows up towards the ceiling, squeezing your shoulder blades and pinching them together. This works on your upper back and shoulders. Do this 20 times.
           </span>
           <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Finally, try the cross-legged bridge lift. To do this, lie on your back and start off in the bridge position, with your pelvis off the ground. Keep your right foot on the floor but cross your left ankle across your knee. Leave your foot flat. Now pulse your pelvis up and down towards the ceiling 20 times, before switching legs and trying the same thing again.

           What are the Best Ways to Help Your Body Burn...
          </strong>
          <p>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            If you want to lose weight and increase your fitness, it can be a long and frustrating process. Your wellness and wellbeing can be greatly boosted by you shedding a few pounds, so it is time to make it a priority. The good news is that there are a lot of simple things that you can do to help speed up your metabolism and start the weight falling off you as quickly as possible.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            Start by adding a bit of fibre to your diet. If you are suffering from irregularity and constipation it can lead to increased weight gain, but the solution to this is very simple. Increase the amount of fibre in your diet and this will improve the health of your digestive tract and stomach. Lots of research also links good dietary fibre with a better metabolism.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            You can find fibre in foods such as fruits, whole grains, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            You could also try cutting carbs out of your diet. Replace

             simple carbs
            </a>
            with complex carbs and fibrous types of vegetable. The simple carbs can cause your insulin levels to spike, and this fat-storing hormone increases your appetite as well as causing you to hang on to calories. Complex carbs have the opposite effect as they keep your levels of insulin low and they also help to control your appetite as they take much longer to digest.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            Taking your vitamins can also help to plan an important role in the mobilisaton of fat and to help you lose weight. Vitamin C is a great example of this, as it is needed to help in the fat-burning process. Some studies have also shown that vitamin D can increase the amount of fat your burn by around 50 percent.

           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            Many people want to lose weight for aesthetic reasons, but there is more to maintaining a healthy weight than looking good. Perhaps you should be more concerned about the risks to your health, and especially to your heart.

            There are many ways that being overweight can have a negative effect on your heart. One of the biggest risk factors for the heart is
            <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/statistics.htm" target="_blank">
             heart disease
            </a>
            . When you are overweight, the extra weight can put a strain on the heart, increasing your risk of heart disease.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            Extra weight around the waist can be particularly risky because midsection fat is different from other fat in the body. Visceral fat is particularly bad for the heart, especially in women. Even dropping as few as 10 pounds can lower your risk of heart disease, so if you are currently overweight, now is the time to act.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            <a href="http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/">
             Cholesterol
            </a>
            is another risk factor for heart disease if it becomes too high. If you have too much in your blood, it can build up in the arteries, causing them to narrow. This slows the blood flow to the heart, which can cause serious problems.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            Cholesterol can be especially problematic because you may not be aware that it is high, so check your cholesterol levels every few years. You don't need to be overweight to have high cholesterol, but being overweight can certainly make it worse.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            High blood pressure can also become worse if you are overweight. This can increase the risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. You can easily get your blood pressure measured, and if it is too high, you should do something about it. Although being overweight can affect blood pressure, eating too much salt and not doing enough activity can also affect it.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
            If you are overweight, you may have a faster heart rate because the heart has to work harder to pump blood around your body. Over time, this can cause the muscles of the heart to thicken, known as hypertrophy, and this can lead to heart failure.

            Work out your Body Mass Index (BMI) to find out if you are overweight. You can do this by using a simple calculation:

           <li>

             Find out your weight in pounds

           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             Multiply it by 703

           </li>
           <li>
            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             Divide this by your height in inches
            </span>

            <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
             And then divide once more by the same number
            </span>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           The ideal BMI is between 19 and 25. If you are over 25, you should start to consider how you can lower your weight.
          </span>
          <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">
           If you are overweight, now is the time to act. Forget about appearances, and think about your heart. Some people enjoy success by simply changing their lifestyles, whereas some people may require more drastic treatment like liposuction. (

           4 Things in Your Life that Make it Impossible...

            Weight loss isnt just about getting the right diet and exercise regimen  although those things are important; its about having the right attitude in place. Without the mindset you need, youre never going to see the results you want. However, according to wellness expert Dan Trink, certain things in your lifestyle might be warping your mindset.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            <b>
             1. Bad Relationships:
            </b>
            Bad relationships lead to stress, Trink explains. And there are few things worse for your body composition than stress. This applies to much more than romantic relationships. Overbearing parents and in-laws, an abusive boss, and needy co-workers, friends, and acquaintances, can stress out your system and cause you to hold onto fat, especially in the abdominal region. Cutting bad relationships can be difficult  sometimes impossible. Youre pretty much stuck with the parents and in-laws, and unless you switch jobs, the boss and co-workers arent leaving either. But make an effort to cut as many toxic people out of your life as possible and you will be happier and healthier for it.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            <b>
             2. Intolerance:
            </b>
            Trink asserts, This one is a real kick in the pants. You eat everything youre supposed to  eggs, fish, lean meat, gluten-free whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables  and yet, you can't shake those last five pounds of fat. You could have a more stealth version of a food allergy: a food intolerance. Such an intolerance causes inflammation in the body. Not a full-blown, swollen-faced allergic reaction, but low-level inflammation that keeps your system from running smoothlyThings such as
            <a href="http://greatist.com/grow/easy-elimination-diet-for-food-intolerance" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="The Easy Elimination Diet Plan for Food Intolerance - Greatist">
             food intolerance
            </a>
            tests (performed through blood work) and elimination diets can identify the culprits. Eliminating these foods might be all you need to jump start your training programme.
           </span>
           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            <b>
             3. Pollution:
            </b>
            Remember Britney Spears? asks Trink. She wasnt exactly a rocket scientist, but she might have been on to something when she sang, Youre toxic! Environmental toxins -pollution, cigarette smoke, cosmetics, metal tooth fillings, prescription drugs, and mercury in fish  are stored in fat cells, and have the potential to wreak havoc on your body. Since your body is smart, and prioritizes survival over ripped abs, it refuses to use these fat cells for fuel. Doing so would release these toxins into general circulation. Essentially, you are holding onto these fat cells so the toxins don't make you ill. So how do we get rid of these unwanted guests, become less toxic, and drop that last chunk of stubborn body fat? You could take measures ranging from infrared saunas, detoxifying foot baths, chelation therapy, all the way to liver and GI tract detoxifying diets. These methods can help you remove metals and toxins from your system. Such measures can be fairly dramatic depending on the source of the toxicity. Consult a specialist before taking on any type of intervention, to determine what, if anything, is appropriate.

           <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">
            <b>
             4. Not Working Hard Enough:
            </b>
            Trink points out, Just because youve been working out consistently doesnt mean you are getting the most out of your training. If showing up is half the battle, the other 50% is the effort you bring to the gym. Most people do not realise what their bodies are capable of enduring. Are you leisurely working on a cardio machine while reading a magazine or talking on the phone? Do you continue to do the same workouts long after your body has adapted to them? If so, take a look at the folks in your gym who appear to be getting results. Chances are, theyre pushing themselves, working at a furious pace, and continually undertaking new regimes. Theres a reason those people have better body compositions than you do. Its not by accident or genetics; theyre busting their asses  and you can too. Youve already done the hard part by dedicating the time and showing up. Now just commit to working harder.

           How Can Hypnosis Help You Lose Weight and Kee...
          </strong>
          <p>
           To lose weight, you need to eat less and move more  you dont need a wellness expert to tell you that! So why, then, are we Brits not in amazingly good shape? Often, it may be a sign that you mental wellbeing is plagued by subconscious baggage thats weighing you down. Clinical hypnotherapist Belinda Hulstrom explains, There are a couple of things that need to happen for us to make changes: we have to want the benefits of that change, and we have to want them enough that we're prepared to do whatever it takes to get them. We also have to believe that change is possible and that often involves overcoming the obstacles that our mind has set up for us.



This is where hypnosis comes in. You spend your life surrounded by negativity, be it from the media, or even your family and friends. According to

           Mark Stephens, creator of the Think Slim programme, this then creates a self-fulfilling prophecy which prevents you from losing weight on a permanent basis. People use a lot of negative self-talk, says Stephens. They'll say, I'm a yo-yo dieter, or Diets don't work. But hypnosis can take away the mental prison bars they've made for themselves. You often eat for the wrong reasons because of your negative emotions. Stephens points out, People will eat when they're sad, lonely, bored or angry  and then they'll feel guilty and beat themselves up afterwards, creating a downward spiral.



In order to lose weight, then, you need to make a change to the way you think. No amount of

            emotional eating
           </a>
           will help repair yourself, Stephens warns. We need to get on top of the negative emotions and learn how to feel happy. With the help of a hypnotherapist, you can break the negative cycle and replace these thoughts with positive ones. Stephens comments, With hypnosis you're bypassing the analytical and reasonable part of the mind and going straight to your subconscious, where all your memories are, and feeding it with positive suggestions. Hypnosis can help by changing people's mindsets. The mindset you need to adopt is one of a long-term goal, rather than a short-term obsession.



Its easy to lose weight on a short-term basis; whats tricky is keeping it off  and thats how hypnotherapy can help. In 1995, a study published in the
           <i>
            Journal Of Consulting And Clinical Psychology
           </i>
           showed that the addition of hypnosis substantially enhanced treatment outcome in six studies relating to obesity and weight loss. The patients who underwent hypnosis continued to lose weight, even after the treatment had ended. Hulstrom echoes the fact that you need to change the way you think about weight loss. She notes, It's not about losing weight but about getting rid of something we no longer need or want and about creating a whole new relationship with food and our bodies.



You also need to train your brain. Hulstrom concludes, Probably the most powerful message hypnosis can get across is that you always have the power to choose. You can have that piece of chocolate cake, but you don't have to have it. Hypnosis can help create a relationship with yourself that's more honest. This is why the Think Slim programme gives participant the following verse to memorise:



I am tomorrow what I eat today, before each meal that's what I say.



The more water I drink, the more inclined I will feel to only eat a nourishing, healthy, slim meal.



Between main meals I drink water or tea, between each meal I stay snack-free.



Excess fat I burn with every step I take, I have no desire for chocolate, ice-cream or cake.



Whether it's a walk, a swim or a sport I play, I aim to be active twice every day.



I stay focused on my goal and the body I deserve, and it all boils down to each meal that I serve.

           Pooch Pounds: How to Help Your Dog Get to a H...
          </strong>
          <p>
           Obesity isnt a just a people problem; dogs are getting fatter too. While shocking statistics reveal that 53% of dogs in the United States suffer from obesity  according to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention  whats more concerning is that 22% of dog owners characterized their pet as normal weight when they were actually obese. Your furry little friend is counting on you to take care of his weight wellness. Otherwise, you could be putting his wellbeing at risk for other illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis. So how can you help keep your dogs weight in check?
           <b>
            1. Be realistic:
           </b>
           Setting a reasonable goal is the primary step in helping your pup shed a few pounds. You dont want to overwork your dog or overdo his diet. Therefore, you need to consult a vet about the most compassionate and caring when plan for your canine, determining how much weight your pet needs to lose to achieve a healthy weight and a moderate, patient way in which to get there. These things take time, so dont rush it.
           <b>
            2. Try to squeeze in a little exercise every day:
           </b>
           Exercising is one of the most effective ways to lose weight, whether youre person or pooch, so try to get your dog moving every day. Taking him for a daily
           <a href="http://www.bhaskar.tv/amanda-bynes-greets-the-new-year-with-a-brisk-walk/" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="Amanda Bynes Greets the New Year with a Brisk Walk">
            brisk walk
           </a>
           will work wonders for the both of you. The PPET (People and Pets Exercising Together) Study showed that working out with your dog enables you to stick with your diet plan better than non-

            dog owners
           </a>
           . Just remember to gradually build up the routine. Once your dog is comfortable with a brisk walk, go for a quick jog or play a game of fetch in the park.
           <b>
            3. Get him to eat little and often:
           </b>
           Portion control is vital to helping dogs lose weight, but how do you know how much your dog should actually be eating? Its easy to overfeed your pet, so take pains to check your dog's food package for the proper amount suggested, and feed him on the lower end of that suggested amount. In 2002, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine found that a calorie-restricted diet helped canines to live nearly two years longer than dogs consuming additional calories. The best thing to do is divvy up your dogs daily calorie needs into smaller portions  just like eating little and often is recommended for humans who want to lose weight. Feeding your dog at least every 12 hours improves his digestion, and also makes him less likely to binge during one big meal.
           <b>
            4. Choose the right foods:
           </b>
           Its not just how much you give your dog and when, but the kinds of foods that are the solution to your canine's weight loss journey. Again, look on the label of your dog
           <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/better-fast-food-packaging-2013-10" rel="wpi" target="_blank" title="Better Fast Food Packaging - Business Insider">
            food package
           </a>
            what order are the ingredients in? The earlier the ingredient is listed, the more of it there is in the dog's food, and so you should be seeing high-quality ingredients at the top of the list. Dehydrated dry foods are often bad examples of this, and your pet will find fresh proteins, carbohydrates and fat sources to be more energetically useful to. To dilute your pets calories and add more fibre, add steamed or pureed vegetables such as broccoli or carrots to his packaged meal.
           <b>
            5. Give him fewer treats:
           </b>
           You love your dog and want to show him how much, but giving him treats is a bad way to do it. Those tiny snacks can really add up in the calorie department, and so youre doing your pooch no favours. Dont let treats equal more than 10% of your dog's daily calories, unless youre dishing out healthful treats such as fresh fruits or vegetables. Carrots, cucumbers, green beans and apples are all good choices.

           Many are surprised to learn that household pets often have as great a weight problem as people. Animals tend to overeat and under exercise which leads to excess body fat. This is especially common in dogs and cats. Some breeds gain weight and overeat worse than other breeds.

           If you have an animal with a weight problem, it is important to quickly get their weight under control. Household pets are susceptible to many of the same health problems as humans when they are overweight. Some common health problems that your pet may encounter if they are overweight are respiratory issues, heart troubles, diabetes, bone and joint pain, arthritis and more.

           One of the best ways to help your animal lose weight is to control their diet. Many pet owners leave a bowl of food out at all times. This makes feeding easier but also allows your animal to overeat. It is best to feed your pet a couple of times each day. The amount of food needed at each feeding varies based on the size of the animal and the food that is used. Most pet food will offer feeding guidelines based on animal weight.

           When feeding your pets a specific amount of food, it is important to make sure your pet gets the food it needs. This can become a concern if there are multiple animals. If you have more than one pet, and one tends to eat more than the other, consider separating the animals during feeding time. This will ensure that each pet gets the food they need.

           Exercise is also important. Exercise will help your pet stay healthy and lose weight. Dogs are one of the easiest pets to exercise. Take them for a walk or spend some time playing catch. Cats can be a little more difficult to exercise. Many owners find that their cat enjoys playing with toys. Find an exercise method that your pet enjoys.

           Monitoring your animal's weight is an important part of keeping your pet healthy. Just like humans, pets need to limit their diet and get proper exercise to maintain their health and avoid debilitating disease.

           Obesity is on the rise for canines. The reasons for this influx are similar to those that humans experience, too much food and too little exercise. The results of obesity are similar for your canine friends too. Studies reveal that 25% of overweight dogs experience severe joint problems. This effects their daily activities such as walking, standing and sitting. It also increases pain and makes jumping up or down off the bed difficult. If a dog is overweight its lungs cannot function properly- the extra fat pushes against the lungs and diaphragm and makes breathing more difficult. Carrying extra weight decrease ability to preform daily activities. It takes more work to do everything. Body systems have to do more than they were designed for because extra weight places strain on the heart, muscles and respiratory system. Because being overweight causes daily tasks to be more difficult and causes more pain, dogs can become more irritable. Dogs who are overweight have a shorter life span and a lower quality of life. However, there are several things that a pet owner can do to help their animals shed the pounds and live a longer, happier life.

           One way to get an idea if your dog is overweight is by checking their ribs. The ribs should not be visible as they stand, but still detectable when you touch them or when they move (such as jumping in the air to catch a Frisbee). If you cannot feel your dogs ribs, they are probably overweight. The first and for most important measure though, is to take your dog to their veterinarian. Your dog should be seen on a yearly basis for a routine check up. One reason why visiting your veterinarian is so important is that some dogs do not look overweight. Large dogs can especially hide weight well. Your veterinarian will be able to decide if your dog is overweight and why. To help your veterinarian keep a record of what you are doing with your dog before you go. Record your dogs patterns such as sleeping, eating and exercise. In some cases weight issues might be due to medical conditions, such a thyroid problems, verses overeating and under exercising.

           Dog's have a strong need for affection. One reason dogs overeat is that pet owners use food as an easy way to show their affection. It is not recommended to do this. Using food as a means of reward trains your dog to seek food for affection. This adds to their weight gain and all the other associated problems. Instead, fill their need for attention with games, petting and playing or get a new toy or go for a walk. Habits are hard to break, so here are few tips to help you. Do not leave food out all day. Set a schedule and a location to eat. One meal per day (or two small ones) is all that a dog needs. Also, one day each week with no food will help burn excess fat which they have stored in their bodies. Dogs are trained in behavior. If they beg at the table and someone gives them food, they learn that begging results in getting what they want. To help change this pattern feed your dog before you eat and keep them in another room while you have dinner. After, take them out for a walk or to play a game so they feel loved and get the attention they need. Once new patterns have been decided upon make sure everyone in the family is on board. Otherwise someone might feel "sorry" for the begging dog and give them "just a little something" and this will slow down or prevent your dog's weight loss, especially if that "little something" is every day. Meet as a family to discuss the need for changes in your dog's diet and how your animal will be effected if you don't. This will help everyone understand why and help them keep the new rules.

           The enthusiasm for new changes might cause over doing exercise at first, but it is important not to do this. Start slowly, for just a few minutes a couple times a day. This will be sufficient at first and then you can slowly increase their activity. Encourage your dog to move around the house with you. Movement frequently and throughout the day is essential. If you take your dog out for a hard run to get him "in shape" it might do more harm than good. Especially when no exercise has been implemented in his routine before. A nice, leisurely walk is sufficient each day and then a couple of times a day as directed by your veterinarian. Another way to get movement is by playing games with your dog. As your dog increases in strength and endurance playing fetch is fun for the dog and helps them get in more activity. Follow your veterinarian's plan and keep appointments. This is especially important if the weight loss is significant.

           Loving your pet is doing what is best for them. Increasing their activity and reducing their treats and table scraps will help them become their ideal weight. Your dog will move easier and breath lighter and you can sleep better knowing their health is on the right track.
