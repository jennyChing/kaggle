             </h3>
             <p>
              Turn Watcher(tm) is an easy to use Initiative and Effect
      Tracker for table-top RPG dungeon masters. It tracks spells
      and other effects, alerting you when those effects expire,
      automates temporary hit points and hit point boosts, tracks
      PCs, NPCs and monsters easily during combat rounds, and
      handles delayed and readied actions in a snap. Use it to
      perform secret Spot and Listen checks and even Will saves on
      your players without them being the wiser. Download your
      copy today!

            <p>
             Helix: The Post Apocalypse, High-Tech, Fantasy, Western Role
    Playing Game is a big name for a game. In it, you take the
    role of a Wastelands denizen. You play Cyber Mystics, Code
    Slingers, Gun Jacks and Gun Jills, Average Joes and Plain
    Janes in an age of cowboys, high noon duels, saloons, and
    magic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately, I have several reviews to do in my queue
    already, and I don't have the time to read and play this RPG
    to share my thoughts with Roleplaying Tips subscribers.
    However, HelixRPG staff Adam, Gloria, and William have
    generously offered a free PDF of the game to a Tips reader
    who would like to write a review for the e-zine.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you have the time and are interested, drop me a note and
    I'll hook you up. This sounds like a fun game, and you can
    find more about it at:

             Word of Caution on Gun Props from Kevin B.
            </h4>
            <p>
             I received this excellent and wise cautionary note from a
    Tips reader this week. Please heed his advice.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Just about all of the advice contained in the Roleplaying
    Tips email is harmless and adds flavor to gameplay. However,
    I feel it necessary to bring to your attention some advice
    that I read in the recent weekly tip email, Roleplaying Tips
    Weekly #425: More Props:
            </p>
            <p>
             "If you're running a modern game and don't have any guns
    around the house, there are still plenty of prop options.
    Even if you don't participate in shooting sports, you can
    usually go to a local range and ask for a handful of spent
    shell casings."
            </p>
            <p>
             Being someone who has been around guns all of my life, in
    addition to teaching gun safety courses, these words alarmed
    me. The majority of gun accidents happen with people who
    thought the guns they had in their hands were unloaded. You
    should never use a real firearm as any kind of prop for a
    game or anything else! This is extremely dangerous and could
    result in injury or even death.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you need a prop that looks like a gun, use a plastic toy
    gun. Even then, make sure it really is a toy, as some
    plastic gun replicas can resemble the real thing. Nowadays,
    it's harder to find toy guns that resemble the real thing
    for the very reason that they don't want children and adults
    to equate a harmless toy gun with the real thing as well as
    eliminate the instances of using plastic guns to commit
    crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the spent shell casings, those are perfectly ok as
    long as they _are_ spent and not live rounds. Even if a
    round is live the likelihood of it going off if you drop it
    or ding it is next to nothing, but why take the chance?
            </p>
            <p>
             Have a great week.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cheers,
            </p>

            <p>
             It's weird. I like to live a simple life of relatively few
    possessions, but I find myself with an alarmingly large
    number of DM accessories. Besides all the books, I have
    miniatures, red beads, rusted keys, laminated maps, 3-ring
    binders, name tags, an egg timer, and all sorts of little
    pieces of paper.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I use all of them in my games, and my games are more fun
    and memorable because of them. Here's how:
            </p>
            <p align="right">

            <h3>
             1. Battle Maps
             <a id="T1" name="T1">
             </a>
            </h3>
            <p>
             I carry three battle maps in my Big DM Bag (more on that
    later). Two maps are on card stock, and the third is a
    flexible, roll-up battle map with 1" squares on one side and
    hexes on the other.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also - and this is important - bought a pack of six
    differently-colored wet erase markers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I use the maps for combat, for non-combat encounters in
    which location is important (such as a room full of traps),
    and to quickly sketch out larger areas for the players.
  "Okay, the city is here, and the mountains are over here,
    with the woods between them here, and you're going along
    this road...". They make great public scratch paper, and are
    the first things I roll out, in the center of the table.
    They are our signal an adventure will soon begin.
            </p>
            <p>
             What's important about the marker colors? My players
    respond strongly to a map where the walls are drawn in
    black, the pool of water is blue, and the three sarcophagi
    are brown. Color brings the map to life.
            </p>
            <p>
             And why do I keep three maps? For large dungeon exploration,
    I quickly run out of space on one map. But I don't
    necessarily want to erase it; the players may well come back
    to this area of the dungeon. So I'll pull out another map
    and start drawing on it.

            <p>
             My groups don't play at my house. As such, I keep all my
    DMing materials in a big duffel bag. This has been a great
    blessing. I'd still use my Big DM Bag even if everyone
    played at my house. All my DMing materials are in one
    (relatively) small place, easy to access and update.

             I use small, semi-clear, red plastic "stones" as tokens.
    When playing a game that uses any sort of action points or
    tokens, they're great - they fit into any era of gaming. I
    keep them in the small plastic tube they came in, and hand
    them out at the beginning of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
             I made sure they look nothing like anybody else's gaming
    materials. My players know to give them back at the end of
    the night.

            </p>
            <p>
             My players love to get physical representations of their in-
    game loot and special objects. Why wouldn't they? So I keep
    my eyes peeled for neat objects, especially at second-hand
    antique shops, county fairs, and odd little stores. I have
    old keys, little carved statues, gems, shells, pewter rings,
    and a pendant, among others. Most of them cost a few dollars
    at most, and I gradually build a collection.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since I'm always writing new adventures and campaigns, I can
    easily find ways to work those into the game. But you can do
    it in a published adventure, too. The shells - all circular
    coral - might be tokens of a cult, always kept on their
    person. That's easy to work in; just include it as part of
    the next civilized human the players kill. The pewter rings
    might be used only by certain nobles to verify their
    identity; very useful, if you can get one. One statue might
    be a magical artifact, kept deep in the next temple the
    players explore, that glows whenever dragons' blood is
    nearby and steadies the blade of whoever holds it.

            <p>
             As with most DMs, I keep a 3-ring DM binder. However, I also

            <p>
             I've also learned the knack of printing double-sided, and I
    use thick printer paper. As a result, I need very little
    table space, and I'm not constantly shuffling papers around.

            <p>
             I printed out my own D&amp;D initiative cards, which contain a
    few very basic fields: Character Name, Initiative, Total HP,
    Current HP, Bloodied HP, AC, and attack (to-roll and
    damage). These take up the top half of each card; the bottom
    half contains any extra, important information (such as
    useful spells or items carried).
            </p>
            <p>
             I've filled out cards for each player-character, and before
    each session I fill out cards for each creature in the fight
    (including pre-rolled initiative!). I also keep a bunch of
    blank ones on hand if I want to add an extra creature or
    three while playing.
            </p>
            <p>
             When combat begins and players announce their initiative, I
    write that down on each initiative card, then put all the
    cards in initiative order. I then flip through the cards and
    announce each player's turn as it comes up. Boom!
            </p>
            <p>
             I also keep track of HP on these cards. As a result, I
    usually only have two things behind my DM binder: initiative
    cards and dice.

    been a big hit. Each card names an effect ("Slowed,"
  "Grabbed," "Deaf," etc.) in big letters, then lists the
    specific rule effects that occur as a result. Each effect
    card is folded in half and placed in front of the affected
    player, as a placard.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, when a character is marked or slowed, I just put the
    appropriate effect card in front of him or her. No more "Oh,
    I forgot she's slowed" or "Now what does 'marked' mean
    again?" moments.

             At the beginning of every session, I toss out a few name
    tags, and everyone's encouraged to write the name of their
    *character* on a name tag and wear it. This helps us to
    remember the characters' names, especially in a larger,
    rambunctious group like mine.

            <p>
             We've had a few players spend many minutes trying to decide
    what to do when their turn came up in combat. So, I
    instituted a light-hearted One Minute Rule. If a player's
    turn comes up in combat, and they're not ready, I put out a
    small, one-minute egg timer. If they haven't decided on
    their action when the sand runs out, we move on to the next
    player. Once the first player has decided on his or her
    action, they can do it once the current player's done.
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't permanently change the player's initiative order.
    I've found that just implementing the one minute rule keeps
    players on the ball.

             Johnn,
            </p>
            <p>
             In going through some old, long forgotten files, I just
    found this one from the
             <a href="http://www.judgesguild.com/archives.html" target="_blank">
              Judges Guild
             </a>
             :
            </p>
            <p>
             Quoted from the website:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <h4>
              Cook Your Own Rat on a Stick
             </h4>
             <p>
              While sorting through the Judges Guild archives I, your
      humble Webmaster, unearthed the following recipe. After a
      bit of research and some help from a reader I found out that
      the author was Pixie Bledsaw, who also drew some of the
      first art in the early days of Judges Guild. Clearly a very
      creative lady!
             </p>
             <p>
              I should warn you that I haven't actually tried this recipe
      yet. It looks very tasty, however. It is basically cheese-
      stuffed meatloaf, and the mere thought of that is making me
      want to abandon my computer and head for the nearest
      kitchen. I'll report further when I have a chance to cook up
      some.

              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
               Cut cheese into half-inch cubes. Impale cheese cubes on

              <li>
               In large bowl, mix beef, egg, cracker crumbs, and pepper.

               Press each section flat until 1/2 inch thick.
              </li>
              <li>
               Wrap each stick of cheese in a section of meat. Make sure
        there are no holes or cracks in the meat that would let the
        cheese leak out while baking.

                </li>
                <li>
                 When spaghetti has softened and turned pink, remove from
            water.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Using unsoftened end, insert 1 piece of spaghetti into
            round end of "rat."

            <p>
             I have a suggestion to all GMs who play extensively with PCs
    who take up too much game time searching. Do not give extra
    description. When a PC looks into a room, only say what he
    sees in a glance.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, a PC enters a room with a three-drawer desk in
    the north corner, a bed on a frame on the west wall, and a
    window above the bed. Telling the PC there are three drawers
    in the desk will make him want to search everything in them
    to an extreme extent. Instead, inform the player there is a
    desk, a bed, and a window. He will search the desk, but he
    won't over-search and eat up precious game time.

              Roleplaying Tips Issue #418
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             In Issue #418 you gave tips about creating city districts to
    give cities better structure and divide them into more
    manageable chunks. This is an idea I've been using for
    awhile and I thought you might like to have a wider view of
    the concept.
            </p>
            <p>
             First, do not limit yourself with districts and the like.
    Here are a few other larger concepts adding to those you
    suggested:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Layers
             </li>
             <li>
              Floors
             </li>
             <li>
              Levels
             </li>
             <li>
              Branches
             </li>
             <li>
              Clouds
             </li>
             <li>
              Building types
             </li>
             <li>
              Departments
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             For example, my campaign has a huge, elven tree city where
    layers of branches act just like districts. Layers of a
    branch go like this, from top to bottom:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The King, castle, and his direct family
             </li>
             <li>
              Nobles, highest ranking military officers, highly wealthy
      merchants
             </li>
             <li>
              High priest and temple along with druids
             </li>
             <li>
              Giant eagle trainers with nests (trainers are well
      respected among elven people)
             </li>
             <li>
              Low rank military officers and soldiers
             </li>
             <li>
              Commoners, shops, inns, fletchers, etc.
             </li>
             <li>
              Grounds below the tree: non-elven residents and
      blacksmiths
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             In my campaign there are two trees: one ruled by a King (the
    one described above) and the other by druids where you have
    a druid circle at the top instead of the King.
            </p>
            <p>
             Districts can be used to define clearly the social class.
    When my players discovered that giant eagles and their
    trainers where living higher up in the huge tree, they
    immediately understood that the elven people valued and
    respected this group more than their own soldiers. That
    powerful realization set the table for the whole elven
    culture in my world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other ideas that work pretty well:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Hill Dwarves
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The deepest are the richest or more important for the
      society. The King is at the bottom. Farmers are just below
      the ground in hillside houses. Diggers, miners, soldiers,
      blacksmiths, etc. are important, so they live down below at
    different depths.
             </li>
             <li>
              Mountainside (Birdman City)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The birdmen have a mountainside city with stairs dug inside
      for ground dwellers to walk up to the top levels. Again, at
      the top, you have the King, but at the mountain top there are
      shrines and temple for their gods. (They believe the King is
      no greater than the gods.) At a certain floor you have the
      hatcheries for the youngest and eggs. Shop are at the ground
    level.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This idea can be stretched to any kind of setting. In a
      ShadowRun game I used this concept for the big bad
    Corporation main building.
              <br/>

              Accountants had levels 1 to 5. Levels 6 to 10 were dealers.
      The villain and his guards where at the top. Below the
      ground were secret research quarters, military labs, etc.
    that again acted as districts.

              Another futuristic example is the famous Midgard in Final
      Fantasy VII where city districts are in numbers that
    correspond to Mako Reactors.

             Erin Smale, designer of the Chimera RPG, sent me a data file
    for TableSmith to generate random NPC monikers and
    nicknames. TableSimth is free software for Windows, and it's
    one of my all time favourite DMing aides. If you haven't
    tried it and you run Windows, be sure to check it out.

             Hi Johnn,
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is a drop and use calendar for GMs. It does not contain
    holidays, so people can fill in their needs. The year has 16
    months and 480 days. Weeks are divided up into five days for
    two reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              480 is divisible by 5, so there will be no staggering of
      days from year to year. Just print out a new calendar and
      go.
             </li>
             <li>
              In some settings, this calendar means a lot of the work
      required doesn't take a break every 6 or 7 days. All work
      and no play is a problem, so the solution is to add plenty
      of holidays and festivals. Some can run multiple days at a
      time. You can also place equinoxes and solstices wherever
      you want.
             </li>
            </ol>
