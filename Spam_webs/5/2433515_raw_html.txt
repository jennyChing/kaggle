       This study suggests ways to maximize the psychological impact of U.S.
airpower in future conflicts. It draws on enemy prisoner of war (POW)
interrogations and other data from the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars
to analyze the psychological effects of past U.S. air operations against both
enemy strategic targets and deployed forces. Among other objectives, the study
aims to identify

       <b>
       </b>
       The psychological effects of air operations can significantly shorten
wars and reduce their costs, particularly in American lives. In some
conflicts, the psychological effects of air operations may exceed the physical
effects in importance.
       <p>
        This report suggests ways to maximize the psychological impact of U.S. airpower
in future conflicts. To do so, it draws on interrogations of enemy deserters
and POWs and other data to examine, compare, and draw lessons from the
psychological effects of air operations in the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian
Gulf wars and to a lesser extent, in World War II. Two types of air operations
in particular have the potential to produce psychological effects that may
significantly reduce the duration and intensity of an enemy's resistance:
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <ul>

         air operations against enemy strategic targets, the destruction or
threatened
destruction of which might help to coerce an enemy government to end a conflict
on terms acceptable to the United States
        </li>
        <li>
         air operations against enemy deployed forces, the demoralization of which
might cause enemy cohesion to disintegrate and battlefield resistance to
collapse.

        Psychological Effects of Air Operations Against Strategic Targets
       </h3>
       <h3>
        <i>
         Experience in Past Wars
        </i>
       </h3>
       <b>
       </b>
       In all major conflicts from World War II on, the United States has
attacked what have been termed
       <i>
        strategic
       </i>
       targets, including targets near
or within the enemy's capital city, to reduce the enemy's physical capacity to
wage war. At the same time, these and other strategic attacks have also aimed
to produce psychological effects. Among other objectives, the strategic air
operations have sought to force enemy governments to halt their aggression and
withdraw their forces from friendly territory, negotiate a truce or peace
agreement, or capitulate. Air operations have also endeavored to generate
internal opposition to the enemy government's war effort and, in at least one
instance, to precipitate the enemy government's overthrow.
       <p>
        The experiences of past conflicts suggest that, while U.S. air attacks on
strategic targets can provide important coercive leverage on an enemy, such
attacks by themselves are unlikely to secure U.S. war aims. To force an
opponent to capitulate or negotiate an end to a conflict, the United States and
its allies also must be able to convince the enemy leadership that its deployed
forces will face defeat or, at best, stalemate if the fighting continues.
Because the enemy's decisions about war termination will depend heavily on his
perception of the likely battlefield outcome, U.S. air planners should consider
enemy deployed forces a strategic target.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         World War II, 1941-1945.
        </b>
        Air attacks on strategic targets in World War
II generally fell short of producing the psychological results their planners
hoped for. This was particularly true of Germany, where the Allied bombing of
cities failed to deny labor to German industry. The psychological effects of
the Allied bombing did speed Japan's decision to surrender and helped shape
Italy's decision to seek a peace accord. However, in neither instance was the
Allied bombing the sole cause for the enemy decision to terminate hostilities,
as the deployed forces of both Axis powers had experienced repeated defeats.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Korea, 1950-1953, and Vietnam, 1965-1972.
        </b>
        Throughout the Korean
conflict and during much of the U.S. combat involvement in Vietnam, the United
States conducted air attacks against military and military-related strategic
targets partly for psychological effect. The principal psychological objective
of these attacks was to persuade enemy leaders to negotiate an early end to the
conflicts on terms acceptable to the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        These air attacks failed to deter the communists from protracting the fighting
for three years in Korea and for over eight years in Vietnam. In addition to
the humanitarian and other constraints the United States imposed on its air
operations, various conditions and attitudes in the enemy camp diluted the
coercive effects of the U.S. strategic attacks. These included the enemy
government's
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         access to support and sanctuary from external powers, which allowed the
enemy
to continue fighting even when its indigenous war-related production facilities
had been destroyed
        </li>
        <li>
         strong commitment to the objectives or cause that gave rise to the conflict
with the United States
        </li>
        <li>
         readiness to absorb enormous human and materiel losses
        </li>
        <li>
         ability to maintain domestic support for the war effort and/or
sufficient internal security to suppress any potential opposition
        </li>
        <li>
         perception that the likely benefits from continued conflict would exceed the
costs resulting from the U.S. bombing.
        </li>
       </ul>
       After having already made what it considered to be its maximum feasible
concessions in both the Korea and Vietnam peace talks, the United States
resorted to escalation or threatened escalation to bring the negotiations to
closure.
       <p>
        Severe U.S. escalation or threatened escalation was required to extract
comparatively modest concessions from both enemies. In Korea, the dual threat
of a widened war with China and the U.S. use of nuclear weapons was needed to
break the deadlock over the U.S. demand for the voluntary repatriation of
prisoners of war. In Vietnam, Washington had to employ massive B-52 and
fighter-bomber strikes on Hanoi and Haiphong to force the communists to
complete a peace agreement, the key provisions of which they had already
accepted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The communists agreed to terms only after their military forces on the
battlefield had been stalemated. Prior to the settlements, the communist
forces in both Korea and Vietnam had mounted major offensives, the defeat of
which left them no prospects for immediate further military gains.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Persian Gulf, 1991.
        </b>
        The principal psychological objective of attacks
against strategic targets in the Persian Gulf conflict was to effect a change
in Iraq's policy on Kuwait. Coalition air campaign planners envisioned the
bombing as possibly effecting such a change by (1) causing the replacement of
the Saddam Hussein regime, which, in turn, would result in a reversal of Iraqi
policy toward the occupation of Kuwait, or (2) persuading Saddam to withdraw
from Kuwait and to comply with the various other United Nations (UN)
resolutions relating to Kuwait.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coalition planners apparently hoped that air attacks might bring an end to
Saddam's regime by (1) incapacitating and isolating Saddam and his senior
aides, (2) encouraging Iraqi military and other regime elements to remove
Saddam, or (3) inciting the Iraqi population to rise up and overthrow the Iraqi
leader. To achieve this outcome, the Coalition focused its air attacks on the
leadership and telecommunications and command, control, and communications
target sets that were thought to constitute the "central nervous system" of the
Baghdad regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of these objectives was realized. Saddam and his senior aides survived
the bombing and retained the capacity to control Iraqi forces. Apparently, the
Coalition lacked the precise and near-real-time intelligence required to
neutralize the cautious and elusive Iraqi leadership. Coalition attacks also
apparently failed to prompt a coup or civilian uprising against Saddam, at
least prior to the cease-fire. Nor is it clear that an attempted coup or
popular uprising would have succeeded. The large numbers of security troops
and police forces protecting Saddam in Baghdad apparently were not sufficiently
reduced by the bombing. Indeed, the Iraqi leader's extensive palace guard,
intelligence, and internal security apparatus seem to have survived the war
essentially intact.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Coalition air campaign directly influenced the Shia and Kurd uprisings that
occurred after the war by encouraging the antigovernment sentiments of the
regular army forces in the Kuwait Theater of Operations (KTO) and contributing
importantly to their catastrophic route. However, the United States declined
to aid these postwar uprisings in part because it wanted to preserve a unified
Iraq as a buffer against Iran. The uprisings were ruthlessly suppressed,
partly by the Republican Guard forces that had been a priority target of
Coalition air and ground attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Saddam moved a significant way toward accepting the Coalition's demands
for an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, in the end he proved unwilling to
agree to withdrawal terms that obligated Iraq to pay reparations and subjected
Iraq to a continued UN embargo. Saddam refused the Coalition demands despite
the pressures exerted by the continued Coalition bombing, including the
devastating attacks on the Iraqi ground forces deployed in the KTO, and the
impending Coalition ground offensive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saddam had staked his prestige on retaining Kuwait to the extent that he dared
not submit to a premature defeat, which might have led to his humiliation and
fall from power. He apparently calculated that a ground battle would be more
conducive to his personal survival than an unconditional acceptance of
Coalition terms. Moreover, Saddam probably hoped that, even if his forces were
expelled from Kuwait, they might still be able to give the Coalition enough of
a "bloody nose" to salvage his international and domestic prestige.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saddam also apparently believed that he could control the risks of a ground
battle by safely extracting the Republican Guard and other high-value military
forces that were important to his regime's survival in the event the fighting
went badly for his side.
       </p>

       <h3>
        <i>
         Lessons for U.S. Commanders
        </i>
       </h3>
       <b>
       </b>
       In possible future conflicts, U.S. enemies are likely to seek to prolong
the combat and increase the human costs of the fighting to the United States in
the expectation that the American public will refuse to accept the casualties,
turn against the involvement, and force the U.S. government to make otherwise
unwarranted concessions to end the conflict. To disabuse adversaries of the
continued efficacy and wisdom of such a protracted warfare strategy, the United
States is likely to turn again to strategic attacks or the threat of such
attacks as a means of creating pressure on enemies for early war termination.
       <p>
        This analysis of the psychological effects of air operations against strategic
targets in past wars has implications for how U.S. theater, air component, and
other commanders might prepare for, plan, and conduct strategic attacks in
future conflicts.
        <b>
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Expect Limits on the Coercive Effects of Strategic Attacks.
        </b>
        Experience
suggests that the bombing of strategic targets alone is unlikely to secure U.S.
war aims. In addition to the various internal factors that may make enemy
governments resistant to such pressure, U.S. self-imposed constraints are
likely to limit the potential coercive leverage that can be achieved through
future air operations against strategic targets. The U.S. concern to minimize
civilian casualties and other collateral damage has increased over time and
will probably constrain severely both the methods and targets of air attacks in
future conflicts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commanders should expect future adversaries to attempt to promote a further
tightening of the constraints on U.S. strategic attacks by (1) stimulating
intense international television and other media coverage of any errant U.S.
bombing that causes civilian casualties or collateral damage and (2)
manufacturing false evidence of errant bombing. Enemies will also exploit U.S.
humanitarian concerns by repositioning war materiel and key personnel in
civilian areas that are expected to be off limits to U.S. air attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        To limit the adverse political effects of U.S.-caused civilian casualties or
collateral damage, U.S. officials in Washington and commanders in the field
must be ready to explain and justify U.S. air attacks to domestic and foreign
audiences promptly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Needless to say, commanders must also exercise care to avoid sanctioning
attacks on targets that carry significant risks of producing civilian
casualties or collateral damage. The negative political fallout from such
errant attacks, including the incitement of anti-American sentiment within the
enemy population, is likely to outweigh the value of the targets destroyed and
may limit the commander's freedom of action in future bombing.
        <b>
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Plan on Multiple Pressures to Secure War Aims.
        </b>
        In the past, a
combination of military pressures and other conditions has been required to
compel enemy leaders to capitulate or agree to a negotiated settlement
acceptable to the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         <i>
          Conditions Producing Enemy Concessions
         </i>
        </b>
        . Attacks or
threatened attacks against enemy strategic targets have helped to persuade
enemy leaders to terminate wars on terms acceptable to the United States only
when the enemy leaders have perceived
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         that they faced defeat or stalemate on the battlefield
        </li>
        <li>
         that they were unlikely to get better peace terms from the United States if
they prolonged the fighting
        </li>
        <li>
         that the cost of the damage from the strategic attacks or threatened attacks
was likely to outweigh significantly the cost of the concessions the United
States was demanding
        </li>
        <li>
         that they had no prospect of mounting an effective defense against the
strategic attacks and saw no possibility of launching a counterattack that
would cause the United States to terminate its coercive operations.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <i>
        <b>
         Conditions Producing Enemy Capitulation.
        </b>
       </i>
       The above four conditions have
also been required to force enemy capitulation. However, the experience to
date suggests that capitulation will probably also necessitate an additional
condition: the removal from power of the leader or leaders who started the
war.
       <p>
        When weighing the possible advantages and disadvantages of demanding total
capitulation from enemy leaders responsible for the initiation of a war, U.S.
decisionmakers and commanders should bear in mind the probable intractability
of such leaders, even when they confront a seemingly hopeless military
situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Consider Enemy Deployed Forces a Strategic Target.
        </b>
        Because battlefield
prospects are likely to weigh so heavily in the enemy decisionmaker's
calculations about war termination, U.S. commanders should consider the enemy's
deployed forces to be a strategic target. Experience shows that air and other
attacks on enemy deployed forces can constitute an important source of pressure
on an enemy government to terminate a conflict. In every major conflict from
World War II on, enemies have capitulated or acceded to peace terms demanded by
the United States only after their deployed forces have suffered serious
battlefield defeats.
       </p>
       <p>
        In future conflicts, enemy leaders are likely to prove equally reluctant to
make concessions or terminate conflicts as long as they see a chance to prevail
on the battlefield. To cause future enemy leaders to abandon the strategy of
protracted warfare, the United States and its allies must be able to
demonstrate that the balance of forces on the battlefield will progressively
shift to the enemy's disadvantage as long as the fighting continues.
        <b>
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Improve U.S. Capabilities to Attack High-Value Targets.
        </b>
        To be maximally
effective, coercive air attacks should focus on targets that the enemy
leadership values highly. It is difficult to divine in the abstract the target
sets that enemy leaders are likely to value the most. However, almost all
enemy leaders are likely to attach high value to their retention of power and
personal survival.
       </p>
       <p>
        To create negotiating leverage from these fundamental enemy interests, a future
U.S. air campaign might aim to persuade enemy leaders that they are likely to
(1) die, (2) be overthrown by internal forces, or (3) be removed by external
forces if they refused to end a conflict rapidly on terms acceptable to the
United States. The credibility that enemy leaders will attach to such risks
will depend in large part on their perception of the U.S. will, capability, and
freedom of action to turn such threats into reality.

       <p>
        To effectively attack or credibly demonstrate a capability to attack senior
enemy leaders, air campaign planners will require near-real-time intelligence
on the whereabouts of such leadership targets--information that will probably
be difficult to acquire in the types of closed, security-conscious regimes that
the United States is most likely to confront. The comprehensive and timely
intelligence required to use air attacks to incite and/or facilitate the
internal overthrow of an enemy regime by other elites is also likely to be
difficult to obtain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Air operations to foment a popular uprising against a well-defended and as yet
undefeated enemy government will rarely succeed. Experience shows that enemy
populations have failed to move against authoritarian governments even when
those populations have been subjected to massive bombing. In future conflicts,
humanitarian considerations are likely to prohibit even limited direct attacks
on civilian populations.
       </p>
       <p>
        A more promising approach may be to threaten the enemy leaders with external
overthrow. Enemy leaders are likely to give credence to the threat of a
possible external overthrow of their regime if the following apply:
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Statements of U.S. war aims allow for the possible total defeat of the enemy
in the event a negotiated settlement cannot be achieved rapidly.
        </li>
        <li>
         American air, ground, and naval deployments and military operations against
enemy deployed forces are consistent with an ultimate objective of achieving a
total military victory and occupying the enemy's homeland.
        </li>
        <li>
         The pattern of air operations against strategic targets in the enemy's rear
areas is also consistent with a possible march on the enemy's capital and a
subsequent military occupation.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <b>
        Integrate Psychological Operations (PSYOP) with Strategic Air Attacks.
       </b>
       To maximize the psychological effects of air operations against strategic
targets, such operations must be closely integrated with a supporting PSYOP
campaign. The thematic content of the PSYOP leaflets and broadcasts should
directly or indirectly reinforce the psychological message or messages that the
bombing is attempting to convey. This will require close coordination between
the Air Force officers planning and conducting the air campaign, and the Army
personnel who will be mostly responsible for the design and dissemination of
the PSYOP messages.
       <p>
        In past conflicts, such close integration has sometimes been lacking, in that
both the content and the dissemination of PSYOP messages have failed to support
adequately the psychological objectives of the strategic bombing operations.

         Experience in Past Wars
        </i>
       </h3>
       History demonstrates that air operations can produce significant, even
decisive, psychological effects on the morale and battlefield behavior of
deployed forces. Air attacks can severely reduce an enemy's capability to
prosecute a war by (1) causing enemy troops to desert, defect, surrender, or
flee the battlefield and (2) dissuading troops from manning their weapons and
otherwise carrying out their military duties.
       <p>
        Large-scale desertions and surrenders may be difficult to achieve because of
the effective morale-building and control mechanisms that sometimes exist
within military units and because of the individual soldier's attitudes and
fears, including the soldier's

be captured by his own forces or killed by one side or the other in the process
        </li>
        <li>
         fear of execution, torture, or other mistreatment by his captors
        </li>

         confidence in his combat leaders and loyalty to his immediate comrades and

       This study analyzed five periods during the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf conflicts
in which the testimony of former enemy personnel provides insights about the
battlefield conditions that seem to produce or fail to produce the collapse of
resistance and large-scale surrenders and desertions among enemy deployed
forces:

occurred and when few North Korean and Chinese troops surrendered or deserted

        <li>
         1963-1972 in Vietnam, when communist resistance never faltered decisively
and
when only a small number of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and Viet Cong (VC) main
force troops defected or surrendered
        </li>
        <li>
         January 17-February 28, 1991, in the KTO, when the morale of the Iraqi
deployed forces collapsed and vast numbers of Iraqi troops deserted home or
surrendered.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <b>
        Conditions That Did Not Necessarily Lead to Large-Scale Surrender and
Desertion.
       </b>
       Some conditions clearly contributed to poor enemy morale but
not necessarily to large-scale surrenders and desertions.
       <p>
        <i>
         <b>
          Initial Morale.
         </b>
        </i>
        While the status of enemy morale at the beginning of a
conflict can importantly determine the pace and scale of enemy demoralization
once the fighting begins, initial morale is not a sufficient explanation for
why troops surrender or desert in large numbers in some conflict situations,
while in others they do not.
       </p>
       <p>
        Differences in starting morale help to explain why the Iraqi forces collapsed
so completely and why the cohesion of the VC main force and NVA units fighting
in South Vietnam held up for so long. Starting morale, however, does not
explain the collapse of North Korean forces in fall 1950 or the collapse of
Chinese communist units in spring 1951. Both the North Korean and the Chinese
troops possessed high morale when they first entered the fighting.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         <b>
          Casualties.
         </b>
        </i>
        While high casualties undoubtedly demoralize enemy troops,
the number of enemy forces killed does not necessarily correlate with the
number of enemy surrenders and deserters. The Gulf conflict, which produced
the smallest number of enemy killed both in absolute terms and as a proportion
of the number of forces deployed, produced the largest number of deserters and
prisoners. In contrast, the Vietnam War, which saw the largest number of enemy
killed, produced only a small number of NVA and VC main force prisoners and
defectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though North Korean and Chinese communist units--when on the
attack--continued to take significant casualties during the last year and
one-half of the Korean War, very few Chinese or North Koreans surrendered or
deserted to UN forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         <b>
          Intensity and Quality of PSYOP.
         </b>
        </i>
        The intensity of the PSYOP in the
various conflicts also does not explain the difference in the number of
surrenders and deserters. Allied PSYOP in Vietnam, which involved the
dissemination of an estimated 50 billion leaflets, were more intensive than
those in Korea and Iraq. Yet no decisive erosion in enemy resistance occurred
in Vietnam. The PSYOP effort was least intensive in the Gulf War, yet massive
numbers of Iraqi troops deserted and surrendered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither does the quality of the PSYOP seem to explain the difference. While
the Coalition's PSYOP campaign against the Iraqi forces deployed in the KTO
appears to have been particularly well designed and executed, the allied PSYOP
in Korea and Vietnam were also competent operations, particularly with respect
to offering assurances of good treatment to prisoners and deserters.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Conditions That Consistently Produced Large-Scale Surrender and Desertion.
        </b>
        This examination of the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf wars suggests three
conditions that have consistently produced a catastrophic disintegration of
enemy resistance and large numbers of enemy surrenders and deserters.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         <b>
          Sustained, Effective Air and Other Attacks.
         </b>
        </i>
        The Gulf and Korean cases
demonstrate that sustained air attacks on deployed forces can prompt and
facilitate large-scale enemy surrenders and desertions by (1) demoralizing
enemy soldiers and giving them a reason to surrender or desert, (2) degrading
the enemy combat leader's capability to reconstitute troop morale, and (3)
providing the troops with the opportunity to surrender or desert. The
communist forces that were routed in Korea in fall 1950 and spring 1951 and the
Iraqi units that disintegrated in the KTO in February 1991 all had been
subjected to sustained allied military attacks prior to their collapse.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the conflict situations in which enemy troops were not subjected to
sustained, effective attacks, their resistance did not collapse, and they did
not surrender and desert
        <i>
         en masse
        </i>
        . The last 20 months of the Korean War
produced few North Korean and Chinese surrenders or desertions, largely because
the communist troops, except for the brief periods when they were on the
offensive, were usually well protected by an elaborate system of bunkers,
trenches, and tunnels that was largely impregnable to air and artillery attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        Communist forces in Vietnam were rarely subjected to sustained air, artillery,
or other military attack. Communist commanders largely retained the initiative
about where and when their units would fight, and as a consequence the
communist forces were able, for the most part, to control their own combat
exposure and casualties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most communist units fought only a few times a year, perhaps once or twice
every six months, and then only briefly. After engagements with allied forces,
communist troops withdrew to rear areas, where they could evade further air
attacks by frequently changing locations and remaining under the protective
cover of the triple-canopied rain forest.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         <b>
          Resulting Food Shortage.
         </b>
        </i>
        A second condition that seems to have prompted
the collapse of enemy resistance and large-scale surrenders is the food
shortage resulting from sustained and effective bombing of enemy lines of
communication (LOCs) and supply vehicles. Many of the enemy forces that
collapsed in Korea in fall 1950 and spring 1951 and in the Gulf in early 1991
suffered from severe shortages of food. Prisoners and deserters in both
conflicts cited food shortages as a leading reason for low morale in their
units.
       </p>
       <p>
        In combat situations in which food was adequate, unit cohesion did not
disintegrate and few troops surrendered. Once the battle lines in Korea had
stabilized in late 1951, communist troops began to get adequate food. While
some VC and NVA units experienced temporary food shortages, the abundance of
food sources throughout South Vietnam enabled communist troops to enjoy
adequate food rations in most areas nearly all the time.

         <b>
          Timely Ground Attacks to Exploit Collapsing Morale.
         </b>
        </i>
        Ground offensives
to exploit the deterioration of enemy morale have proved to be the final
condition common to the situations in which collapsing enemy resistance has led
to large-scale surrenders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The erosion of North Korean morale that occurred as a result of sustained UN
air and other attacks in summer 1950 was exploited in September 1950 by the
Inchon landing and the UN breakout from the Pusan perimeter. Similarly, the
serious deterioration in Chinese fighting will that existed prior to the defeat
of the Chinese offensive in May 1951 was exploited by a major UN
counterattack.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of the Iraqi forces in the KTO, the Coalition's 100-hour ground
offensive in February 1991 exploited the widespread demoralization of Iraqi
ground troops that had resulted from the Coalition air campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vietnam War saw little, if any, battlefield exploitation of enemy defeats
or losses of morale. Once U.S. forces had found and fixed the enemy, they
usually relied on air and artillery rather than ground forces to finish him.
Even when U.S. troops attempted to close with the enemy, the jungle terrain
usually made it extremely difficult to prevent his escape. Army of the
Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units rarely closed with enemy forces and virtually
never attempted to pursue retreating enemy troops.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, communist units mauled by friendly air attacks and defeated in
battle were invariably able to withdraw to rear areas where they could rest,
refit, and rebuild their morale.

         Lessons for U.S. Commanders
        </i>
       </h3>
       <b>
       </b>
       This analysis of the psychological effects of air and other military
operations against deployed forces in the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf wars
suggests the following implications for U.S. theater, air component and other
commanders:
       <p>
        <b>
         Emphasize Psychological Aspects in Training, Planning, and Operations.
        </b>
        To exploit fully the potential of U.S. military operations against deployed
enemy forces, U.S. commanders will need to devote increased attention to the
psychological dimensions of warfare in the planning and conduct of their
operations. Commanders should avoid the bifurcated approach often evident in
the past, when combat operations were used mainly to produce physical effects
on the enemy and PSYOP messages were used to produce any desired psychological
effects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commanders should understand that military operations rather than PSYOP
messages produce the most important psychological effects. Commanders should
also realize that combat operations can inflict psychological damage to an
enemy deployed force that equals or even exceeds the physical damage suffered
by that force. The psychological effect of combat operations applies
especially to sustained air and artillery attacks, which have proved capable of
decisively undermining the cohesion and fighting will of enemy ground forces.
As the Korean and Gulf wars have demonstrated, enemy demoralization opens the
way for rapid and low-cost battlefield victories.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recognition that military operations produce the decisive psychological
effects does not lessen the importance of PSYOP, which exploit and reinforce
the psychological effects created by military pressure. PSYOP cost little and
can be a significant force multiplier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commanders must also seek to minimize the potential adverse psychological
effects of their military operations. In rural and urban guerrilla conflicts,
for example, air commanders must restrict and carefully control air attacks to
avoid causing civilian casualties that would create additional recruits and
popular support for the enemy side.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that future combat leaders and planners understand the psychological
dimensions of warfare, the psychological effects of military operations and
PSYOP should receive increased coverage in military training and in the
curricula of the service war colleges and command and staff schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Adopt an Overall Campaign Strategy That Promotes Psychologically Effective
Attack.
        </b>
        The war-fighting commander should adopt an overall campaign
strategy that will force enemy ground units to react in a manner that will
expose them to prolonged and psychologically effective aerial and other attack.
To erode decisively an enemy's will to fight, friendly aircraft may have to
attack over a period of several weeks or more. The air operations and ground
fighting that preceded the collapse of enemy forces in Korea in 1950 and 1951
lasted several months; the air campaign that so demoralized Iraqi troops in the
KTO lasted 38 days.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Make Demoralization an Air Campaign Objective.
        </b>
        In past conflicts, the
psychological effects of air operations have been largely unplanned and
unanticipated. Air campaigns should be designed to maximize the psychological,
as well as the physical, effects of airpower. To ensure that adequate
attention will be given to psychological effects,
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The air component commander should make the destruction of enemy morale a
priority air campaign objective.
        </li>
        <li>
         Personnel expert in psychological effects should be included on air campaign
planning staffs.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <b>
        Employ Concepts of Operations That Maximize Psychological Effects.
       </b>
       The
air component commander should adopt concepts of operations that will maximize
the psychological effects of airpower. To this end, he should
       <p>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <i>
          Keep enemy forces under attack or at least under the threat of
attack, around the clock, for a protracted period
         </i>
         .
         <b>
         </b>
         Maintaining
attack aircraft day and night over all sectors of the battlefield may require a
large force. Because the ubiquity of the friendly air presence is likely to
have a demoralizing effect on enemy forces, flights to and from deeper targets
should be vectored over enemy troop concentrations whenever possible. To deny
the enemy leaders an opportunity to reconstitute the morale of their troops,
commanders should oppose suggestions for temporary cease-fires or other
respites in the air campaign.
        </li>
        <li>
         <i>
          Deny food to enemy forces by attacking supply depots, interdicting
LOCs, and destroying thin-skinned supply vehicles.
         </i>
         Experience also shows
that round-the-clock armed reconnaissance flights along enemy supply routes can
prove sufficiently intimidating to enemy drivers that they will refuse to drive
resupply missions.
        </li>
        <li>
         <i>
          Use heavy bombers for surprise and shock effect.
         </i>
         <b>
         </b>
         In
the
Vietnam and Gulf wars, the B-52s were often the aircraft most feared by enemy
troops, even though they frequently failed to hit their intended targets. The
advent of Global Positioning System targeting should make heavy bomber attacks
with general-purpose bombs more accurate and allow heavy bombers to be employed
in closer proximity to friendly lines. Attacks by heavy bombers equipped with
precision weapons could have devastating psychological effects in that they
would permit the sudden devastation of bunkers and other hardened emplacements
immune to destruction except by direct hit.
        </li>
        <li>
         <i>
          Make the enemy believe his air defenses are impotent.
         </i>
         <b>
         </b>
         Experience shows that enemy forces are demoralized when aircraft can attack
them with virtual impunity. Thus, in addition to the obvious traditional
reasons the air commander has for holding down his combat losses, there is a
psychological reason as well. To convince the enemy that his resistance is
futile, U.S. aircraft should strive to attack him with near zero losses. The
advent of new sensor, stealth, standoff, and precision-strike capabilities
should make it possible for U.S. forces to approach the achievement of this
demanding objective more closely.
        </li>
        <li>
         <i>
          Condition enemy personnel not to operate their weapons and other
equipment.
         </i>
         <b>
         </b>
         Enemy personnel should be taught by PSYOP messages and
military actions that it is dangerous for them to operate or remain with their
equipment. Friendly aircraft should strive to react promptly to any enemy
vehicular movement, artillery or antiaircraft firing, or the use of radios,
radars, and other emitters. The objective of these air conditioning operations
would be to convince enemy forces of the following:
         <p>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           If you fly, you die.

        </li>
       </ul>
       <b>
        Develop Weapons That Increase Airpower's Psychological Impact.
       </b>
       The Air
Force should seek to develop and acquire sensors and weapon systems that will
magnify the potential enemy's perception of American air prowess. Among the
capabilities that might have particularly strong psychological effects would be
sensors and weapons that would allow U.S. aircraft to detect and attack
effectively enemy (1) artillery and mortars immediately upon their firing and
(2) personnel and equipment positioned in camouflaged, hardened emplacements or
under heavy foliage.
       <p>
        <b>
         Exploit Psychological Effects of Air with Timely Ground Operations.
        </b>
        Experience shows that weaknesses in the cohesion and morale of enemy ground
forces are likely to be temporary and subject to repair. After air attacks and
other sustained military pressures have eroded the cohesion and fighting will
of an enemy force, a ground offensive should be mounted promptly to exploit the
psychological vulnerabilities that have been created. Timely ground attacks
enable U.S. forces to reap the maximum battlefield benefits of the cumulative
psychological softening. Effective follow-up by ground forces must be
particularly rapid when one is attempting to exploit the shock effects of a
particular, massive bombing attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Integrate PSYOP with Air Attacks Against Deployed Forces.
        </b>
        Air planners
should work closely with their PSYOP counterparts to integrate and coordinate
military operations and PSYOP messages. Such close coordination was sometimes
lacking in the Gulf War. Air attacks can enhance the credibility and
receptivity of PSYOP messages. PSYOP can be used to solidify and exploit
perceptions created by air attacks. PSYOP messages help to break down two key
barriers to surrender and desertion: (1) enemy concerns about how to surrender
or desert safely and (2) enemy fears about treatment after capture.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Know Enemy Psychological Strengths and Vulnerabilities.
        </b>
        Because
information from former enemy personnel is so vital to the assessment of the
effects of military operations on enemy morale and to the design and evaluation
of PSYOP messages, war-fighting commanders must ensure that enemy motivation
and morale receive high priority in prisoner and deserter interrogations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Air Force should develop a cohort of PSYOP specialists and psychologically
oriented intelligence specialists, including trained interrogators, to work
with Army personnel in conducting and evaluating prisoner and deserter
interrogations, in designing PSYOP messages, and in assessing the psychological
impact of air and other military operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Begin Psychological Conditioning in Peacetime.
        </b>
        The Air Force and other
U.S. military services have two principal reasons for advertising their
capabilities to potential adversaries during peacetime: to deter the would-be
aggressors from attacking U.S. interests and to begin the psychological
softening of the potential adversaries in the event war does occur. For the
Air Force, much of this advertising will be a natural by-product of air shows
and peacetime training and deployment exercises. These and other opportunities
should be used where appropriate to demonstrate the superior capabilities of
technologically advanced U.S. aircraft and weapon systems.
