         Starch thickeners give food a transparent, glistening sheen, which looks nice in a pie filling,

         Starch thickeners don't add much flavor to a dish,

       This starch thickener has
      several advantages over cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor, so
      it's a good thickener for delicately flavored sauces. It also works
      at a lower temperature, and tolerates acidic ingredients and prolonged
      cooking better. And while sauces thickened with cornstarch turn into
      a spongy mess if they're frozen, those made with arrowroot can be frozen
      and thawed with impunity. The downside is that arrowroot is
      pricier than cornstarch, and it's not a good thickener for dairy-based
      sauces, since it turns them slimy.

       Arrowroot also imparts a
      shiny gloss to foods, and while it can make a dessert sauce glow
      spectacularly, it can make a meat sauce look eerie and fake. To
      thicken with arrowroot, mix it with an equal amount of cold water, then
      whisk the slurry into a hot liquid for about 30 seconds. Look
      for it in Asian markets and health food stores.

     ClearJel = ClearJel starch = Clear-jel
     <i>
      Notes:
     </i>
    </b>
    This modified cornstarch is the secret ingredient that many commercial bakers use in
their fruit pie fillings. Unlike ordinary cornstarch, ClearJel works well
with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, and doesn't cause pie
fillings to "weep" during storage. ClearJel is an especially good
choice if you're canning homemade pie fillings, since it doesn't begin
thickening until the liquid begins to cool. This allows the heat the be
more evenly distributed within the jar during processing. This is such an
important safety advantage that ClearJel is the only thickener the USDA
recommends for home canning. You can also use ClearJel to thicken sauces, stews, and the like, though it's a rather expensive
all-purpose thickener. One downside is that products thickened with
ClearJel tend to break down if they're frozen and thawed. If you plan to
freeze what you're making, use Instant ClearJel, arrowroot, or tapioca
starch. ClearJel is available either as pearls or powder from
mail-order suppliers, but it's not yet available in grocery stores.

      This silky powder is used to thicken sauces, gravies, and
      puddings. Like other starch thickeners, cornstarch should be mixed
      into a slurry with an equal amount of cold waterbefore it's added to
      the hot liquid you're trying to thicken. You then need to simmer the
      liquid, stirring constantly, for a minute or so until it
      thickens. Cornstarch doesn't stand up to freezing or
  prolonged cooking, and it doesn't thicken well when mixed with acidic liquids.Cornstarch is called cornflour or maize cornflour in
      Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. Don't confuse cornstarch with
      the finely ground cornmeal that Americans call corn flour.

       These small, starchy granules are used to make tapioca pudding and to thicken
  pie fillings. The grains don't dissolve completely when cooked, so
  puddings and pies thickened with them end up studded with tiny gelatinous
  balls. If you don't mind the balls, you can also use instant tapioca to
  thicken soups, gravies, and stews. If the balls are a problem, just
  pulverize the instant tapioca in a coffee grinder or blender, or buy tapioca
  starch, which is already finely ground. Instant tapioca tolerates
  prolonged cooking and freezing, and gives the fillings an attractive glossy
  sheen. To use it in a pie filling, mix it with the other
  ingredients, then let it sit for at least five minutes so that the tapioca can
  absorb some of the liquid. Don't confuse instant tapioca with regular
  tapioca, which has larger beads, or with the even larger tapioca pearls sold
  in Asian markets.

       This thickener is made from the tuber
of the kudzu, the obnoxious vine that was imported from Japan a number of years
ago and is now growing out of control all over the South. It's very
  expensive, and the main reason to buy it is for its reputed medicinal
  benefits. It comes in small chunks. To thicken a liquid, crush the
  chunks into a powder, mix them with an equal amount of cold water, then stir
  the mixture into the hot liquid and simmer for a few minutes until the sauce
  is thickened. Look for kudzu in
health food stores.

       This gluten-free
starch is used to thicken soups and gravies. Its main advantage over
other starch thickeners is
that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other
grain-based foods.Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be
boiled. Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher
products.

    These are small beads of tapioca that are used to make tapioca pudding.
  The beads don't dissolve completely, so they end up as small, squishy,
  gelatinous balls that are suspended in the pudding. Don't confuse this
  with instant tapioca, which is granulated and often used to thicken fruit pie
  fillings, or with pearl tapioca, which has much larger balls.

      These

      puddings and a beverage called bubble tea. You can also use them to
      make tapioca pudding, though it's faster and easier to use instant or
      regular tapioca. The pearls are normally soaked for at least a few
      hours before they're added to a recipe.

      Tapioca
      is a good choice for thickening pie fillings, since it
  thickens at a lower temperature than cornstarch, remains stable when frozen,
      and imparts a glossy sheen. Many pie recipes call for instant
      tapioca instead of tapioca starch, but instant tapioca doesn't dissolve completely and leaves small gelatinous
      blobs suspended in the liquid. This isn't a problem in a two-crust
      pies, but the blobs are more noticeable in single-crust pies.
      Tapioca starch is finely ground so that it dissolves completely,
      eliminating the gelatinous blob problem. The starch is also
      sometimes used to thicken soups, stews, and sauces, but the glossy finish
      looks a bit unnatural in these kinds of dishes. It works quickly,
      though, so it's a good choice if you want to
  correct a sauce just before serving it. Some recipes for baked goods
      also call for tapioca flour because it imparts a chewier texture.

       Asian cooks often dredge foods in this
before frying them, because it gives fried foods a crisp, nutty coating.
It can also be used as a thickener. Look
for it in Asian markets and health food stores. Don't confuse this with chestnut
flour.
