  <meta content="Most people assume that when a serial killer is sent to jail, they'll be there for the rest of their lives. However, sometimes serial killers dont spend the rest of their days behind bars. Despite contrary belief, they have actually been set free to live amongst everyday people like you and your friends. Many of the killers on this list served a short amount of time behind bars before being set free, while other unknown sociopaths are still on the run and being futilely chased by the authorities. Regardless, you'll want to lock your door at night." property="og:description"/>

             Most people assume that when a serial killer is sent to jail, they'll be there for the rest of their lives. However, sometimes serial killers dont spend the rest of their days behind bars. Despite contrary belief, they have actually been set free to live amongst everyday people like you and your friends. Many of the killers on this list served a short amount of time behind bars before being set free, while other unknown sociopaths are still on the run and being futilely chased by the authorities. Regardless, you'll want to lock your door at night.

               <p class="caption" data-caption="South African Killer" style="display:none;">
                Nine gay men have been murdered in South Africa between 2010 and 2012. Similar to a Craigslist killer, the serial killer meets the men online, gains their trust, and murders them after being invited into their homes. The police only recently confirmed that the killings form part of a serial killer investigation. Although a few suspects have been reprimanded, the killings have continued unabated in the African country.

                In Edgecombe County, North Carolina, ten black women have disappeared in the past ten years  nine have since been found murdered. All of the victims were involved in sex trades and had issues with substance abuse. The killer is widely believed to still be at-large. A man named Antwan Maurice Pittman was convicted of one of these murders in 2011, but with inconclusive evidence, the majority consensus is that he is not the Edgecombe County serial killer, and the real evil-doer is still out there.

               <p class="caption" data-caption="The Jeff Davis 8" style="display:none;">
                Jennings, Louisiana has been terrorized by an unknown serial killer since 2005. Eight women have been found murdered and dumped close to the small towns back roads. All the women had two things in common: they all hung out at the same bar and they all struggled with drug addiction. The local residents firmly believe one of the towns police officials is involved in the murders, but only 4 arrests have ever been made, none of which amounted to anything. The case is one of the most pressing unsolved serial murder mysteries in the United States. It's believed the popular show "True Detective" was based on the Jeff Davis 8.
