        In late 1997 Cathy Scott published "The Killing of Tupac Shakur", which
contained an autopsy photo of Shakur that had been leaked by a source within
the Las Vegas police department.

       </p>
       <p>
        Tabloid offers as high as $100K were turned down for the photo, which we
reproduce above. LVMPD was not happy about the photo being leaked, but being 
property of the people of the United States, it is in the public domain.
We reproduce it here.
