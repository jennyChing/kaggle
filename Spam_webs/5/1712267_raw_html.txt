    "O

   ne Art" not only effects such poetic
reversals but exposes them as affected. Bishop's choice of a villanelle, a
traditional form of repetition that promises to make "art" out of
"losing," seems to support the opening assertion, but the negatives
cast doubt on the project at the outset:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    The art of losing isn't hard to master;
    <br/>
    so many things seem filled with the intent
    <br/>
    to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Yet the title tells us that the art of writing and the art of losing are one,
and the requirements of the form serve to render loss certain from the start.
The third line already gives us the last word of the poem-the word she means to
deny but is fated to write:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
    <br/>
    I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident
    <br/>
    the art of losing's not too hard to master
    <br/>
    though it may look like
    <i>
     (Write
    </i>
    it!) like disaster.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Writing and losing are one art because the formal repetition of loss, which
promises mastery, simultaneously finalizes disaster: "(
   <i>
    Write
   </i>
   it!)
like disaster." Repetition duplicates and divides, both masters and loses,
and thus makes for "disaster." The division-by-duplication of the
"aster"
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   the ill star that governs poets.

   The loss of love here is not over and thereby mastered, but threatened: a
possibility brooded upon, or an act being endured. How Bishop dramatizes the threatened
loss is uncanny. "I shant have lied," she claims. Under such intense
emotional pressure she shifts to the decorous "shant," as if the better to
distance and control her response to this loss, the newest and last. And again, my
minds ear often substitutes "died" for "lied." In self-defense,
lying makes a moral issue out of the hearts existential dilemma; a way of speaking
is a habit of being. The real moral force of her stanza comes  and this is true in
many other Bishop poems  from her adverbs:
   <i>
    even
   </i>
   losing you; not
   <i>
    too
   </i>
   hard to master. These shades of emphasis are so carefully composed, so lightly sketched
in, that their true dramatic power is missed by some readers.
  </p>
  <p>
   And then that theatrical last line  how severely, how knowingly and helplessly
qualified! It reminds me of that extraordinary line in "At the Fishhouses," at
three removes from itself: "It is like what we imagine knowledge to be." The
line her begins with a qualification ("though"), goes on to a suggestion rather
than the assertion we might expect of a last line ("it may look"), then to a
comparison thats doubled, stuttering ("like  like"), interrupted by
a parenthetical injunction that is at once confession and compulsion, so that when
"disaster" finally comes it sounds with a shocking finality.
  </p>
  <p>
   The whole stanza is in danger of breaking apart, and breaking down. In this last line
the poets voice literally cracks. The villanelle  that strictest and most
intractable of verse forms  can barely control the grief, yet helps the poet keep
her balance.

   Bishop's late poem, "One Art' (whose title conveys the implicit suggestion that
mastery sought over loss in love is closely related to poetic control), articulates the
tension between discipline in life and the force of circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>
   The poem speaks in the tones of the survivor:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    the art of losing isn't hard to master;
    <br/>
    so many things seem filled with the intent
    <br/>
    to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The opening fine, with its echo of a folk prescription such as "an apple a
day," leads into the specifics of daily lossof keys, of timesyntactic
parallelism suggesting an evaluative equation of what we immediately recognize as hardly
equal realities. Such parallelism, by providing a temporary distraction that draws the
reader away from the force building in the poem, functions as a disarming form of humor
that undercuts the potential self-pity otherwise latent in the poem's subject.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
    <br/>
    of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
    <br/>
    The art of losing isn't hard to master.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   "One Art" presents a series of losses as if to reassure both its author and
its reader that control is possibleironic gesture that forces upon us the tallying
of experience cast in the guise of reassurance. By embracing loss as Emerson had Fate (the
Beautiful Necessity), Bishop casts the illusion of authority over the inexorable series of
losses she seeks to master.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
    <br/>
    places, and names, and where it was you meant
    <br/>
    to travel. None of these will bring disaster.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The race continues between "disaster" and "master" as the losses
include her mother's watch, houses, cities, two rivers, a continent, and, perhaps, in the
future, an intimate friend whom, breaking out of the pattern of inanimate objects, the
poem directly addresses:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
    <br/>
    I love) I shan't have lied. Its evident
    <br/>
    The art of losing's not too hard to master
    <br/>
    though it may look like
    <i>
     (Write
    </i>
    it!) like disaster.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Here conflict explodes as the verbal deviations from previously established word
patterns reflect the price of the speaker's remaining true to her initial claim that
experience of loss can yield to mastery. With a directness that comes to predominate in
Bishop's later work, "One Art" delineates the relationship between the will and
the world. Note the split of "a gesture / I love" across two lines; the
profession stands by itself as it turns back toward the beloved gesture. Syntax reveals
the pain "One Art" has been fighting, since its beginnings, to suppress as the
thought of losing "you" awakens an anxiety the poem must wrestle with down to
its close. This last time, the refrain varies its form, assuming an evidentiary structure
that challenges as it expresses what has hitherto been taken as a fact recognized from
within the poet's consciousness. Coupled with the addition of "it's evident" is
the adverbial "too" (Its evident / the art of losing's not too hard to
master"), which increases the growing tension within the desire to repeat the poem's
refrain while admitting growing doubts as to its accuracy. In the end, the pressure to
recapitulate the by-now-threatened refrain betrays itself in the sudden interruption of
the closing line by an italicized hand that enforces the completion of the
"master" / "disaster" couplet that the poem itself has made, through
its formal demands, an inevitable resolution: "the art of losing's not too hard to
master / though it may look like
   <i>
    (Write
   </i>
   it!) like disaster." The repetition of
"like" postpones, ever so fleetingly, the final word that hurts all the more.
The inevitability of "disaster" ironically recalls the fatalism of such
childhood rituals as "he loves me; he loves me not" - in which the child's first
words, "he loves me," and the number of petals on the flower determine the
game's outcome. In its earlier evocation of folk ritual and in the villanelle's rhyme
scheme, "One Art" reveals an ironic playfulness that works in collusion with
high seriousness, a strategy that proliferates throughout Bishop's work.

   "One Art" is Bishop's one example of a villanelle, a form she admired and
tried to work with for years. It is widely considered a splendid achievement of the
villanelle. . . . Loss is its subject, but the poem begins almost trivially. The first
line, casual and disarming, returns throughout the poem. The natural-sounding contraction
helps to create the semblance of real speech even within this complex form, and the
details and examples that follow immediately do not, indeed, seem like great losses. Door
keys, a wasted hour, even forgotten names certainly do not warrant the term consistently
invoked by the rhyme: "disaster." But the poem builds, until "cities"
and "realms" -- of great import to this geographically inclined poet implied by
this and all her books -- have been lost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not until the final quatrain, bringing the villanelle to the completion of its required
form, does the real occasion of the poem appear. Here the loss is very personal, a person,
"you." Yet the details and attributes here too are muted. Only parenthetically
does Bishop reveal the importance of the you: "(the joking voice, a gesture / I
love)," yet love is evident through the speaker's difficulty in revealing herself.
There is a slight change, too, in the refrain line: "the art of losing's not too hard
to master," qualifying that original assertion that loss "isn't hard to
master." And in the final line the speaker must even exhort herself to complete the
rhyme  (
   <i>
    Write it!) --
   </i>
   since disaster looms very large indeed. Yes, says the
poem, this is a great loss, which I am still working to master. After the suicide of
Macedo Soares, Bishop returned to the United States, and so the loss of lands and love
compound one another. At least in part, "One Art" is a deeply felt elegy, but
Bishop uses both a strict and difficult form and a casual, conversational tone to hush the
emotional intensity. In this fine poem, her attempt to mute serves also to heighten the
poignancy.

   The simple sentence of the opening stanza seems to subvert the title, declaring that
this poem is
   <i>
    not
   </i>
   about art; rather, it is concerned with an acquired skill, the
"art of losing." Critics anxious to commiserate with poets will find this
reading psychologically appealing. Not only does it guarantee numerous opportunities to
rehearse this art, but (Bishop suggests through the acceleration of enjambment) supplies
materials branded "with the intent / to be lost." This perishable quality
simultaneously allows for repeated practice and diminishment, if not extinction, of the
pain. The poet offers a primer for the mastery of disaster, couched in the Puritan form of
the sermon to others for their moral improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mindful always of the common auditor, Bishop forces the second stanza to visualize with
the philosophical ruminations of the first. Readers learn precisely how to master this
art, and are urged to practice, to make it into a virtuous habit: "Lose something
every day." A further injunction counsels the reception and approval of that
resulting disorderthe "fluster"produced by haste, undue agitation.
Loss, art, master, disasterthe lofty conceptual diction of the first stanza crumbles
in the mockery of this near rhyme. The "lost door keys, the hour badly spent"
become concrete entities and lost time. The refrain vulgarly collides with
"fluster"to master fluster?in an uneasy rhyme casting the very tone
of the poem into doubt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bishop enforces a progressively dynamic, almost uncontrollable, schedule of loss in the
third stanza.
   <i>
    Then
   </i>
   simply shifts the focus to the next lesson. No longer does the
homilist tally manageable, sympathetic incidents; the poem has moved beyond them to over-
whelming concerns: places, names, and destinations. Each reader must supply concrete
examples. The "intent" of the first stanza blossoms into the broader intentions
of "where it was you meant / to travel" of the third stanza. Bishop continues to
induce specific details from the reader as the pace and range grow. Soon drained of
places, names, and travel plans, the reader must struggle to fill the lists. The muted
refrain rings hollow as these clustered categories of loss and faster/disaster
cacophonize.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the impersonal professorial tone, the abrupt introduction of the lyric
   <i>
    I
   </i>
   requires
immediate reappraisal of all that comes before this stanza. The homilist's experiential
knowledge, suppressed in the first half of the poem, surfaces as the teacher has obviously
experienced frustration in the auditor's ability to comprehend these lessons of loss.
Bishop draws to the heart of the matter and summons the ultimate parting gift, her
mother's watchan artifact that links the living and dead, recalling a time,
expressing a generationmaking tangible the feeling of irretrievable loss. Bishop
literally lost her mother's time, as the stories "In the Village" and
"Gwendolyn," and the poems "Sestina" and "Manners" all
demonstrate. Looking beyond autobiography to the truth of this loss, however, Bishop
exploits what is, after all, only one more "minor family relic."
  </p>
  <p>
   The exemplum confounds conventional ideas of the subjective and objective, and
demonstrates that loss is grave and universal, but too conventional to be deeply personal.
She defers the threat of sentiment by the sweeping rhetorical gesture of "And
look!" Her life, no longer a chaos of events, seems orderly and safe as Bishop
inventories and schedules her losses: "my last, or / next-to-last, of three loved
houses went." Her autobiography assumes an oddly reassuring linearity and
predictability as the poem hurtles toward its closure. In spite of approximate
knowledge"my last, or next- to-last"the end is palpable by its very
proximity.
  </p>
  <p>
   This registry of loss proceeds to the missing "three loved houses." Even that
great modifier
   <i>
    loved
   </i>
   cannot convert these houses into homes. In spite of the wisdom
of Bishop's crusade"Home-made, home-made! But aren't we all?" (see
"Crusoe in England")the expatriot narrating this poem remains homeless.
  </p>
  <p>
   The narrator, further emboldened by self-knowledge, begins again with "I
lost." The scale has tipped; forsaking the personal for "two cities, lovely
ones" the poet supplies lineaments and character to these scenic vagaries. Like the
child-artist of "Sestina," the speaker approaches the unspecified, the
unembraceable, yet concrete, type of loss: "two rivers, a continent," the loss
of which suggest the impermanence, the unpossessable nature of the earth itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though there remains a tension between the public and private exempla, that tension is
ill-defined and ill-conceived. Bishop has adhered to the standards and expectations of her
aesthetic; she has captured knowledge within the language and form of the villanelle. Yet
with the displaced utterance delivered sotto voce, Bishop conveys a struggle between
growing self-knowledge and her poetic of reticence in this dialogue between the self and
the lost. "Even" moors this hierarchy of loss to that always poorly articulated
world of extremitywithout you, I can't go on, I can't live without youthose
contracted conditionals meant to express the inexpressible love between two people. What
threatens to emerge is that very thing her rhetoric strives to cloak: the self, naked to
the vagaries of language. This ultimate series of I-You dependencies is the final protest
against human perishability. Herein lies the true lesson of loss: "Even losing
you." Turning from her common audience, Bishop allows the parenthetically ensnared
qualities to create a caesura: "(the joking voice, a gesture / I love)." Readers
participate in the auditory and visual recall of pleasure (not pain) reduced to this
synecdoche for the severed other. The positive qualities of this ultimate sacrifice
displace the irritations and categorizations that came before in the poem. The situation
challenges not the pupils but the master herself. In the almost processional resignation
of "I shant have lied. It's evident" rests the captive wisdom of the poem.
In the extended refrain
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    the art of losings not too hard to master
    <br/>
    though it may look like (
    <i>
     Write
    </i>
    it!) like disaster.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   readers see that parenthetical cure for the only true disaster. This encapsulated
lesson is for the master alone; unlike the free, gestural "And look!" designed
to deflect attention from the self, the parenthetical injunction maps a course for only
one. The poet knows that only knowledge, not wisdom, can be shared. Like the child in
"Sestina," the adult must also make some
   <i>
    thing
   </i>
   of absence. Her reward is
the knowledge with which to write. In this rare command"(
   <i>
    Write
   </i>
   it!)"Bishop
distinguishes herself from even Stevenss "Snow Man," who is "nothing
himself," emerging as she does in this dramatic echo of William Carlos
Williamss "Say It!"
  </p>
  <p>
   The formal constraints of the sestina and villanelle freed Bishop to work with personal
material without inducing the maudlin self-despairing tone she despised. The most
forbidding and private sorrows, monumentalized in art, oddly affirm human dignity,
emotion, and care.

    as distinctively Bishopian in its restraint, formality, classicism. Yet
this poem deals openly with loss and has been rightly called by J. D. McClatchy
"painfully autobiographical." The formal demands of the villanelle
keep "squads of undisciplined emotion" from overwhelming the poem,
while James Merrill has spoken of "One Art" as resuscitating the
villanelle in that its "key lines seem merely to approximate themselves,
and the form, awakened by a kiss, simply toddles off to a new stage in its life,
under the proud eye of Mother, or the Muse." Personal expression makes the
form looser, more pliant and intimate. In fact, Bishop uses form frequently, and
especially here, to show its arbitrariness, its attractive flimsiness. Bishop
claims that she had not been able to write a villanelle before but that
"One Art," possessing a somewhat diaristic dating through its metrics
and tone, "was like writing a letter." It is a form tellingly
imitative of the obsessional behavior of mourners with their need for repetition
and ritual as resistance to "moving on" and their inevitable search
for substitutions.

"disaster." From the beginning, Bishop presents "the art of

alternating rhyme of "master" with "disaster," disaster has
the last word. "The art of losing isn't hard to master" is true
because losing is all we do. The poem reveals a struggle for mastery that will
never be gained. We can only make loss into therapeutic play. One does try to
master loss, but Bishop recommends that we recognize our powerlessness and play
with the conditions of loss: the blurring and splitting of presence and absence,
being and nonbeing.

    At the outset he was in a passive situation--he was
overpowered by the experience; but, by repeating it, unpleasurable though it
was, as a game, he took on an active part. These efforts might be put down to an
instinct for mastery acting independently of whether the (repeated) memory were
in itself pleasurable or not. But still another interpretation may be attempted.
Throwing away the object so that it was "gone" might satisfy an
impulse of the child's, which was suppressed in his actual life, to revenge
himself on his mother for going away from him. In that case it would have a
defiant meaning: "All right, then, go away! I don't need you. I'm sending

    Freud
finally hands over to a "system of aesthetics" (17) the consideration
of how pleasure can come from repeating traumatic moments of dissatisfaction.
The child's rendering of loss in symbolic terms with the accompanying
verbalization "fort-da" suggests that loss marks entry into language,
as language marks entry into the awareness of the presence of absence. The
shifting between such appearance and disappearance. as we have seen, becomes
quite vivid through abruptly sequential sentences of "In the Village":

    In
a sense, Bishop practices the "instinctual renunciation" Freud points
to in her poem not only by making loss an intention and active practice (as she
does by swallowing the coins and burying the needles in the story) but by losing
and recuperating words in rhyme. Poetry can imitate through refrain the
experience of "fort-da."

poet's "one art" handles plural loss; but the expansion of this phrase

control, abandon, renunciation. Bishop instructs us: "Lose something every
day," and in the third stanza, "Then practice losing farther, losing
faster." The tercets logically build up from small (keys) to big
(continent) with demonic precision and momentum. We are reassured by the second
stanza that mastery will come to the novice in time, that we will develop the
ability to "[a]ccept the fluster." Yet the items lost become
increasingly personal with her "mother's watch" at the center,
deliberately at the beginning of a line as if to skip over it with a distracting
exclamation, one that further heightens the way the poem presents a

continually refigured, the child of "Sestina" drawing yet
"another inscrutable house." As we move forward, we also step
backwards. The watch stands in for her mother's absence and lossa timekeeper
that reflects its inability to "keep" time. Embedded in the loss of
the watch is also the loss of her mother's caretaking and vigilance, as well as
her father's position as timekeeper.

and acceptance of losing. We no longer have an object such as the timepiece
standing ill for a person but an evanescent voice and gesture, silhouette and

"The art of losing isnt hard to master" by the addition of

to the recognition of displacement and loss. Rhyming, dashing, parenthesizing,
jokingall these are activities meant to contain but in emphatic practice
remind only how such strategies finally fail. They can lead to renunciation not
by making "disaster" into reified form but by accepting it as process
and reenactment.

    The
"work of mourning," explains Freud, involves a gradual withdrawal of
investment from a loved and lost object but against such a necessity "a
struggle of course arisesas maybe universally observed that man never
willingly abandons a libido position, not even when a substitute is already
beckoning to him." Bishop's art is one that gives up fixed positions. We
can now understand, perhaps, how "One Art" is only seemingly far
removed from
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

     The Diary
    </i>
    or "In the Village": these texts demonstrate as
well, as we have seen, Bishop's concern with absence as it participates in
writing. Language insists upon presence but always keeps loss in sight through
its movement; ultimately it cannot hold back the fluid self and reminds us of
the space left between us and our words.

    Elaborating
upon Freud's "fort-da," which brings language and loss together,
Jacques Lacan asserts that the experience of primal loss and the emergence of
identity coincide in language. An originary unrelocatable moment, removing us
from a state of undifferentiated wholeness with our mothers, commits us to
continuous desire and translates us into the symbolic order of language and law.
We become bound up in the paradoxical condition that "is neither the
appetite for satisfaction, nor the demand for love, but the difference that
results from the subtraction of the first from the second, the phenomenon of
their splitting"; our "demand for love," the articulation of it,
then, puts us forever out of love's reach. Coming to see and say ourselves
outside of the maternal body, we call ourselves others and feel the loss that
this entails.

  <p class="MsoNormal">
   <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
    Since
our identity, our assertion of "I," can only be constituted through
language, according to Lacan, we see ourselves as whole or unified
subjectivities only through the "function of meconnaissance" most
notable in the mirror stage when the child sees its fragmented drives and motor
impulses duplicated as a whole-but a whole that rests on the split or chasm
necessitated by mirroring; the "meconnaissance" occurs as "form
situates the agency of the ego, before its social determination, in a fictional
direction" and offers a gestalt, or "an exteriority in which this form
. . . is certainly more constituent than constituted" and that
"symbolizes the mental permanence of the I, at the same time as it
prefigures its alienating destination." Language, thus, aids us in
believing the false vision of wholeness even as it shows such a vision to be an
oversight. Consciousness attempts to veil over the power of the signifier over
the signified, "the incessant sliding of the signified under the
signifier" that represents the operation of the unconscious. Poems that
reflect such ontological uneasiness will appear from Bishop's first volume on,
with its "Gentleman of Shalott" presenting a character divided by a
shifting, unstable mirror, living within the breach "of constant
re-adjustment, " within perpetual yet "exhilarating" uncertainty
and halfness (
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">

almost literalizes the Lacanian fracturing of the self.

    Lacan,
as does Bishop, always points us back to our language. Dreams rely upon the
functions in language of metonymy and metaphor, covered over in waking
consciousness to conceal fissure. Both metaphor and metonymy reveal that we
cannot escape an endless chain of signifiers. Metaphor corresponds to
"condensation," the superimposition of one signifier upon another:
"
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">
     One word for another,
    </i>
    that is the formula for metaphor";
metonymy, on the other hand, reflects "displacement," the continual
"veering off of signification," the "eternally stretching forth
towards the
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
     desire for something
else"
    </i>
    ("Agency," 156), much like the tireless and timely
parataxis another early poem "Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete
Concordance" discovers in its own text and the childhood book it describes
with "Everything only connected by 'and' and 'and"' (58).

   <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
    According
to Lacan's psycholinguistic model, we are constituted by a language that
deconstitutes us, where "no signification can be sustained other than by
reference to another signification" (150): subjectivity is always then, at
risk, so precarious that it becomes appropriate to say: "I think where I am
not, therefore I am where I do not think" (166). The entry into the
symbolic through the Oedipal event inaugurates a gendered subject while the
desire for wholeness exists in excess of possible satisfaction: this desire for
completion will be thwarted by the subject's fragmentation within language. The
phallus comes to stand for that moment of rupture from the imaginary dyadic
relation with the mother, where one does not feel desire for the Other, because
the Other is yet the self, or not other, without limit or demarcation. Lacan's
definition of demand is relevant in showing the gap that persists between the
subject's need and demand; this gap constitutes desire, so that "[d]emand
constitutes the Other as already possessing the
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">
     privilege
    </i>
    of satisfying needs, that is to say, the power of
depriving them of that alone by which they are satisfied"; this explains
the "unconditional element of the demand," which must look beyond
itself to some fictive "'absolute' condition," and it is from such an
absence, "the residue of an obliteration" that "the power of pure
loss emerges," which cannot, in any last analysis, be singularized or
pinpointed ("Signification," 287).

    Such
an understanding of language and identity as grounded in loss is central to
Bishop's feminist attempt to undo fixed or unitary identity. Jacqueline Rose's
introduction to Lacan's essays makes clear his acknowledgment that the phallus
is made only to
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
     figure
    </i>
    by anatomy and
signals its own "pretence to meaning," and the impossibility of
satisfying desire; sexual identity is only "enjoined" upon the
individual through entrance into language. Because of the arbitrary element in
gender division, Rose sees implicit in Lacan's argument the possibility that
"anyone can cross over and inscribe themselves on the opposite side from
that which they are anatomically destined" (49). Lacan's project, in this
light, encourages boundary transgression, especially if we consider his belief
that analysis should not allow an individual to mask over the precariousness of
her or his identity.

    In
the Lacanian economy, woman becomes, however, "other. "As Rose
exposes, the phallus is by no means unproblematically privileged, for it is:
"from the Other that the phallus seeks authority and is refused," but
even as woman is subversive Other, Rose does not think females have "access
to a different strata of language" (as does Yaeger, for example, in her
discussion of "In the Village"): there is no escape from the Law of
the Father (55). However, as Lacan does not differentiate enough the breakage of
mother-child dyad in terms of the child's gender, he
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
     misses
    </i>
    the distinct relationship that persists between mother and daughter. The
female may indeed, come to the symbolic via an alternate routeher language a
different relation to loss. For the girl child, the ruptured primordial
relationship may appear less final, and her gender role less reified than the
boy's in his identification with his father, as Chodorow has described. Rose
objects to Chodorow's apparent assumption of a unified identity (37), yet
Chodorow acknowledges gender position as social construction that makes
intrasubjective shifting more available to women; in his emphasis on lack and
loss, Lacan does not acknowledge
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
     relation
    </i>
    (as
do both Chodorow and Bishop), primarily because his androcentric perspective
posits woman as the eternal Other.

    If
language is joined inseparably with the recognition of loss, females come to
that language doubly exiled from the dominant sign system. Nevertheless,
identification with the mother makes for a potentially more pluralistic and
multiple self. Julia Kristeva, for instance, rereads Lacan and posits a
"questionable subject in process" that exists through the fluctuation
between the poles of the semiotic (associated with the unconscious, the
maternal, the disruptive) and the symbolic (responsible for the rational, the
paternal, the systematic). She considers such movement "poetic
language," which through its "signifying operations, is an unsettling
processwhen not an outright destructionof the identity of meaning and the
speaking subject," and links the feminine with poetry, or more precisely,
with the disruption it produces. While she does not explicitly catalogue her
writing as feminist or, for the most part, treat women writers, Kristeva
tellingly concedes: "It is probably necessary to be a woman . . . not to
renounce theoretical reason but to compel it to increase its power by giving it
an object beyond its limits" (146).

    Bishop's
poems subvert the very formsnot in themselves radical or
"avant-garde"they employ. "One Art," specifically, casts
itself either forward or backward: testing the limits of rational control,
revealing the subject unsettled within flux; it literalizes displacement through
its calling up of and discarding of objects. While "One Art" appears
almost hyperrational, it remains consistent with Bishop's earlier more explicit
surrealismthe Paris poems "Sleeping on the Ceiling," "Sleeping
Standing Up," and "Paris, A.M.," to name the most
strikingwhich openly affronts reason and logic, manipulating dream symbols in
incongruously neat stanzas, to disorient and to trouble. We come upon form, yet
cannot locate or settle into a "subject." Bishop wrote at least
seventeen drafts of "One Art" before she considered it written.
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>
    Not surprisingly, the act of writing is a focal concern of the poem, as
becoming an artist is in the story "In the Village." Earlier drafts of
the poem show her struggling with the crucial final stanza where phrases such as
"Say it," "Oh, go on, write it!" recur as she tries to allow
herself to articulate "disaster." Draft 2 even has the tentative
entitlement: "(Why not just write 'disaster'?)," protected within a
parenthesis. The stilted archaism of "shan't" reveals the essential
feebleness involved in the final version's assertion "I shan't have
lied." In some of the telling drafts, she simply admits "all that I
write is false. I'm writing lies now. It's quite evident"with false
crossed off. Writing may tempt us into lies, but it also shows us up. It is only
in the process of "writing it" that Bishop can face the catastrophic
losing of a love, though the drafts do not foresee surviving such an event: the
first one trails off with the impossible maxim, "He who loseth his life,
etc.but he who /
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">

death had upon Bishop or without appreciating the topographical loss Bishop felt
in repatriating to the States from Brazil: loss of person, home, family, country
can hardly be disengaged (126). The seventeen drafts Bishop wrote present a
series of "mislayings," a word Bishop uses in her first version, and
the published poem continues to confess its inevitable lying. "I really /
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">

    want to introduce
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
    </i>
    identity
is predicated upon mislaying, so that like the more lavishly described loved one
who disappears into a flickering "you," the "I" completely
goes under. The "you" is at first an "average-sized"
"dazzlingly intelligent person" with blue eyes that "
    <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
     were
    </i>
    exceptionally beautiful" (draft 1), and does not, by the way, seem
necessarily identifiable with Lota, but with all those whom she has lost or
could lose. What becomes "eyes of the small wild aster" in draft 2
evaporates in the remaining trials. "One Art," with all its drafts,
represents an archaeology of the struggle with losing. a process that is always
with us, so that every loss comes to be all losses, retrogressive and
prospective, shuttling through villanelle. As a love poem, "One Art,"
as Goldensohn points out, does not necessarily signpost a same-sex relationship.
Yet it must; for we know what we know. It is stitched together through a lineage
of female loss, with the mother's watch in the centrifugal position, with all
other love relationships with women timed by it.

    Throughout
her work, Bishop will test and question the boundaries imposed by
"theoretical reason" with the awareness that we must resort to them;
if we continue to use Kristeva's model, language and sense emerge only in the
spaces created through severance from the semiotic. Retrieval through rhyme in
"One Art" again serves as a way of pointing up the passage of language
from the semiotic through the symbolic; form becomes a net through, which
identity and all its belongings slip. In spite of Bishop's reliance on form, her
poem disturbs through its attention to arbitrary and frangible boundaries.
Ultimately, Bishop practices forfeiture, a recognition of human limits and
imperfection, and therefore, also a potentially freeing activity. When Adrienne
Rich writes "It's true, these last few years I've lived /

    in desire and attachment. Bishop's poem suggests that she would like to
write off artfully what she realizes always eludes inscriptionthose spaces
marking the losses of a "questionable subject"; the form of poems
becomes, again and again, expressive of the unruly processes of consciousness
they denote.

   [B]y embodying uncontrollable emotion in a form meant to control it, and in an
utterance meant to deny it, Bishop can create tension, ambivalence, and a poignant
recognition of the pathos of human attempts to control the uncontrollable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the earlier drafts of this stanza, Bishop struggled with the desire to say and
unsay, to say two things at once, both admitting to the truth of the argument that the
villanelle has established and admitting to the evasion of the truth that the tone has
insisted on. To accomplish this she tried lines such as "of course, Im
lying" and "its evident Im telling the truth"; one draft of one
verse completely explodes the villanelle form:
  </p>
  <p>
   All that I write is false, its evident
   <br/>
   The art of losing isnt hard to master
   <br/>
   oh no
   <br/>
   anything at all anything but ones love. (Say it: disaster).
  </p>
  <p>
   This duality that Bishop works so hard to achieve in draft after draft (there are
seventeen drafts of "One Art" in vassars manuscript collection) she
finally finds in one word, "shant." This word, with its overformal
stiffness, its anachronistic sound, its school-marmish precision, says both "Im
lying" and "Im not lying." Using the future perfect tense allows an
ambiguity that no other grammatical structure can provide. Bishop accomplished the feat of
expressing her ambivalence about her own endeavor; in the word "shant" she
combined opposite meanings in one utterance.
