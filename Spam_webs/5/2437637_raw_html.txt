     Once you get the hang of making jewelry, you will probably be like me and make SO much jewelry you won't possibly be able to wear  
            it all! Then, your friends will see your amazing handmade jewelry creations and they will be begging you to make that gorgeous jewelry  
            design for them. It won't be long until you are selling your own jewelry, either at home jewelry parties, jewelry shops and gift  
            boutiques, or on-line by selling jewelry on eBay, or even creating your own on-line jewelry store and website. Here are my own personal tips for your jewelry 
            hobby and jewelry business, and I will share  
            links to even more helpful resources to get you started on your way.

     Home Jewelry Parties
    </h3>
    <p>
     I have had many successful home jewelry  
            parties, and not only are they profitable, but a lot of fun. What  
            could be better than having a bunch of friends over, some good food  
            and drinks--and a whole table of all your wonderful jewelry for  
            sale? You can also make jewelry "while they wait",  
            allowing people to select their beads from your stash and you can  
            make up custom jewelry right then and there--people LOVE this! The  
            only downside is you are so busy making jewelry that you won't have  
            much time to enjoy the party.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, you can have your friends set up their own parties and act        
            as hostess, while you (the designer) just show up with your goods,        
            allowing your friend to keep some percentage of the sales for the        
            party.These parties are a great way to earn some        
            extra income. Can you see the possibilities?Some tips for a        
            great jewelry party:
    </p>
    <p>
     Send invitations at least two weeks in advance so people can make        
            plans. I like to use www.evite.com to create my own email        
            invitations. They have lots of fun templates to choose from, or if        
            you prefer paper invitations, make your own using stick on crystals        
            or find some jewelry themed cards.
    </p>
    <p>
     IDEA - To really grab people's attention and interest, attach a        
            pair of earrings to the invitation. It might cost you a few bucks,        
            but people love getting something for free and it is a good teaser        
            for your sale of more expensive items.
    </p>
    <p>
     Make sure you have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and a 
            nice selection of snacks available. You don't want to break the bank 
            on food and drink as it will cut into your profit margin (unless of 
            course you are doing the party just for fun, which is fine), but you 
            do want the party to be enjoyable by all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Decorate with tablecloths and candles. Allow yourself an hour to        
            set up before guests arrive...in addition to any food prep time. I        
            use a black velvet scrap of fabric I picked up at the fabric store        
            as jewelry looks great on it. Some jewelry looks better on a light        
            background, however, so pick up a few tablecloths or fabric and give        
            yourself some options. Decide ahead of time which table or tables        
            will be used for displaying your work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Try to decorate in a way that will enhance the style of your own        
            jewelry (fun, sophisticated, etc.). Use jewelry displays (which you        
            can purchase on eBay) such as necklace busts, earring holders, and        
            jewelry displays, or use whatever you have--a wicker tray filled        
            with glass marbles makes a good backdrop for bracelets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Always make sure you have good lighting so people can see the        
            jewelry. Play some music softly in the background to complete the        
            ambiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, candles are a really nice romantic        
            touch.Have measuring tape, jewelry pliers and some basic        
            findings, table or hand mirrors, gift wrap and cards, and business        
            cards ready.People may ask you to customize the length        
            of jewelry, so a measuring tape and basic findings comes in very        
            handy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pliers are invaluable for making customizations on the        
            spot.Gift wrap is always a great way to close the sale        
            on a special gift for someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone will want to see the jewelry in a mirror, so make sure        
            you have some around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, give everyone in sight at least a few business cards so        
            they can pass them out for you, or find your website and contact        
            info later when they want more jewelry!
    </p>

     Finally, check out this website, www-craft-selling-parties.com as

     Selling Jewelry on eBay
    </h3>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     I did very well selling my jewelry on eBay, and I am sure you can, too.      
            eBay makes it simple for anyone to get started selling on-line.      
            There are entire books on techniques you can use to make selling easier, and to maximize your profits.      
            I will boil it all down for you in my       
            Ten Simple Steps to Selling Jewelry on eBay, and if you would like to learn more, refer to the       
            Books section for some recommended additional reading.
    </p>
    <p>
     Follow these steps and you will be on your way to listing and selling your own jewelry.
    </p>
    <h3>
     <strong>
      Ten Simple Steps to Selling Jewelry on eBay
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      1) Get an eBay Account
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     First, you will need an eBay account. This is simply your eBay nickname with a password so that eBay can recognize you and track your sales.   
            If you don't have an eBay account, just go to ebay.com and sign up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Decide how you want to receive payment for merchandise. For example, will you accept checks or money orders?      
Do you want to accept payment instantly into your bank account, or do you want people to be able to pay with credit cards?      
If so, I recommend you set up a Paypal account. It's quick and easy, used by a majority of people on eBay, and I have used it personallyfor years.   
To set yourself up with Paypal, just visit paypal.com.
    </p>
    <!-- Begin PayPal Logo -->
    <!-- End PayPal Logo -->
    <p>
     <strong>
      2) Take Photos ofyour Jewelry
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Next, you will need to take photos, and write a description of your jewelry.      
I recommend a digital camera because you can immediately upload photos to your PC, but if you don't have one, when you get your film developed, make sure you get the option to get your digital             
image files burned on a CD, or available to you on-line. Take a close-up picture of your jewelry using bright lighting.      
TIP - If you're going to be selling a lot on eBay, you might want to consider purchasing special lighting reflectors known as a Cloud Dome.      
You might want to take a few photos at different positions and perspectives to best display your piece.Once youhave taken all your pictures, crop, edit or re-size them as necessary.TIP: Computer monitors can only display 72dpi resolution             
images, so to save disk space and time in loading the image on a computer, save your files so they are only at 72dpi             
(dots per inch) resolution. You can upload your pictures directly to eBay or to a photo hosting provider.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      3) Write a Great Headline and Description
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Take the time to write a good headline and description, so people will be tempted to click on your auction listing and bid.      
"Necklace" will not catch anyone's eye, but "Sterling silver handmadedesigner necklace with garnets" might do the trick.      
Then, in your listing description, give all the details of your jewelry. In my auctions, I always listed the colors, materials and stones, type of metal, and length of the piece.      
Get creative and use plenty of adjectives like "eye-catching", "stunning", "one-of-a-kind".
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      4) Determine Packaging and Shipping Costs
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Figure out what it will cost you to ship the jewelry, or offer "calculated shipping" which will calculate shipping based on zip code.      
Don't gouge people on shipping! No one will be happy to buy jewelry only to find out you charged them $10 to ship a 1oz package (unless you are shipping Express overnight).      
As a tip, offering free shipping is a nice way to get bids (just build shipping into your minimum auction price).      
Also, build something into your price for packaging. I always carefully package jewelry in a nice organza pouch or gift box.      
Presentation is everything!

     <strong>
      5) Decide your Starting Auction Price orBuy it Now
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     It's no secret that the lower your auction starting price, the better your chances of creating excitement leading to a "bidding frenzy" and lots more bids on your item.      
However, you don't want to lose money either, so this will likely take some trial and error.      
If you know the absolute minimum you need to make on a piece, start your auction at that price or set a reserve minimum at that price.      
If you are going to be selling a lot of jewelry on eBay, you might offer just a few pieces at a very             
special low price just to build your customer base and get bidding going. You can also allow people to buy your jewelry directly at a fixed price with "buy it now".

     <strong>
      6) Use eBay's Listing Tools to Create your Listing
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have never sold anything on eBay, don't worry. They have made it easy.      
Just follow the
     <a href="http://sell.ebay.com/sell" onclick="window.open('http://www.making-jewelry.com/cgi-bin/counter.pl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsell.ebay.com%2Fsell&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.making-jewelry.com%2FJewelry-Business.html'); return false;" target="_new" title="Selling on eBay">
      step-by-step selling instructions
     </a>
     they have on their website and in no time you will be a pro at listing auctions.      
Here are the steps you will need to fill in to create your auction listing.      
In the last step, you will have a chance to review your whole auction listing and make changes before you launch your auction.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Category (I always list my jewelry under the "Jewelry &amp; Watches", "Handcrafted Artisan Jewelry" category. )
     </li>
     <li>
      Title &amp; Description
     </li>
     <li>
      Pictures &amp; Details
     </li>
     <li>
      Payment &amp; Shipping
     </li>
     <li>
      Review and Submit
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      7) Bidding - Watch the Fun Begin
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     After your auction has launched, watch to see how the bidding goes. As you become more well-known and popular as a jewelry designer on eBay, your customers will come back for me and you can expect repeat sales and higher bids.      
Don't be too discouraged if your auctions don't get bids at first, just experiment with your photos, details, and pricing and eventually you will learn what makes your jewelry sell!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      8) Close the Deal
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once someone wins your auction (congratulations, wasn't that exciting?), you need to get payment.      
Most people deal with Paypal these days, and will pay you immediately. If you have not set yourself up with      
Paypal, I strongly encourage that you do as it makes it so much easier for people to buy from you.      
If you have decided to accept checks as payment, you might want to stipulate             
that jewelry won't ship until payment has cleared, or unless the buyer has a             
positive feedback rating. You want to protect yourself from potential bad             
checks (yes, unfortunately there are some people out there who might take             
advantage) while also establishing reasonable expectations and making it easy             
for customers to buy fr
     <font size="3">
      om you.
     </font>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      9) Shipping &amp; Customer Service
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Customer service will make or break any business, but             
especially on eBay because people have the ability to leave feedback regarding             
every single transaction they have with you. Your positive feedback rating             
is worth its weight in gold on eBay so do everything in your power to keep yours             
up. So, make sure you ship promptly and that you carefully wrap items to             
prevent damage. If desired, you can offer optional shipping insurance to             
customers.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      10) Feedback Time
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the transaction is all completed, be sure to leave             
positive feedback for your customer...but only AFTER they have left feedback for             
you. This way if there are issues or problems you can work with the             
customer to address them. Don't ever leave negative feedback for someone             
until you have tried to address and resolve the issue first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wasn't that fun and rewarding? Now it's time to start all over!
