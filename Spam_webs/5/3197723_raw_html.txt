          With the president's lackluster campaign and miserable four-year record nearly behind them and the media safely ignoring the Benghazi coverup, Democrats are stepping up the voter intimidation phase of the Obama re-election effort.

          King Obama, fresh off a harrowing series of Hurricane Sandy photo ops, returned to his usual ways, calling for supporters to seek "revenge" against Mitt Romney.
         </p>
         <p>
          At a campaign stop in Ohio on Friday, the sparse crowd began booing at the mention of Romney's name. The Man Who Would Be King told audience members, "Vote! Voting's the best revenge!"
         </p>
         <p>
          "Revenge" for what, exactly? If anyone should be the target of voters' desire for vengeance, it should be the current officeholder, but logic is the last thing to expect from a campaign that has spent its time focusing on Big Bird, tax returns and

          . (See a funny parody

          .)
         </p>
         <p>
          Obama and his followers feed each other. They pick up on his hate-mongering vibe and he perpetuates the cycle by encouraging their blood lust. Like yin and yang, it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends.
         </p>
         <p>
          True to form for Democrats, Obama supporters have been burning up Twitter and other social media with

          if the Anointed One does not win on Tuesday.
         </p>
         <p>
          "I'ma start riot if Obama don't win," Vanna Jamie James tweeted in one of the less vulgar posts in the past few days. Along with threats to start riots, there have also been threats to shoot Romney if he wins. (Here's hoping the Secret Service is on that.)

          HBO host Bill Maher, naturally, had to pile on: "If you're thinking about voting for Mitt Romney, I would like to make this one plea: black people know who you are and they will come after you."
         </p>
         <p>
          Maher said that in the context of a joke, but considering that he is a million-dollar contributor to Obama's campaign, it's an open question whether there was a serious statement behind the intended humor.
         </p>
         <p>
          There have been plenty of reports of

           violence by liberals against conservatives
          </a>
          in the past year, but I haven't heard of many cases of conservative violence on liberals during the campaign, though there have been instances of liberals staging "attacks" that they tried to pin on conservatives.
         </p>
         <p>
          The juvenile campaign run by Obama has a lot to do with this sort of behavior, but support of what passes for modern liberalism is very often just the result of an alchemical combination of immaturity and ignorance, with a proclivity toward violence being the inevitable byproduct.
         </p>
         <p>
          Remember, this is the Administration that benefited from ACORN's voter fraud and let the Black Panthers walk away from a slam-dunk voter intimidation case because they were Obama supporters.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just like with the infamous big red "reset" button, bowing to the Saudi king and giving the Queen of England a set of DVDs, Obama's childish instincts have led his campaign down a sophomoric path, one which his lemming-like followers unquestioningly follow.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the president calls for "revenge," will it surprise anyone if the day after losing the election the country's cities are on fire?

                No true Christian would keep someone who is kills with impunity - and I'm talking about stinky old BO watching Stevens and CIA being murdered in Benghazi.  Of course, this certainly isn't the extent of the evil for which Zero is responsible.  It's just the lastest batch of lies.  Oh - and Debra, check out the folks in Long Island and see how much help Obumbler has been to them.

                That's the biggest load of bull hockey I've ever heard. In 2008 the New Black Panther Party stood outside of polling places in Philadelphia with billy clubs in their hands intimidating voters. Charges were filed against the Panthers and Eric Holder informed his staff that he would not prosecute cases against blacks, no matter what evidence was presented. Now that's a serious miscarriage of justice! We may call you an idiot for voting for this disaster of a president, but we would never threaten you with bodily harm. And just what are you informing Christians about??? That your candidate actively promoted killing babies who survived partial birth abortions while in the Illinois legislature. Oh yes, he voted for that at least 3 times and actively promoted it. Or are you informing Christians about Obama's mentor the communist Frank Marshall Davis? Or how about how Obama started his political career in the home of Bill Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dorn Ayers? Ayers and his wife are domestic terrorists responsible for the killings of 7 people at the World Trade Center. Somehow they escaped serving time for their crimes. Seriously, have you ever even researched Obama's past?

                I don't think so, I haven't ever heard anything on the bias media about Republican intimidation. And how about the NAACP calling on the United Nations to come watch our voting to insure Republicans don't interfere?? What's that all about? The UN is the most bias group of thieves and thugs outside the United States. They have no right to be here or oversee squat in our country or at least until King Obama lets them. Even our Constitution says our states have the right to arrest or kick them out yet Obama says know. Sorry I don't want him in there again. I like my freedom and intend on keeping it. If you don't value yours that's your problem but don't try to make it mine. I can't help it if you are blind to the failure he has been for the past 4 years and what an even bigger mess he and Biden will make of our country. God help us all. God Bless America and her people because NO ONE ELSE WILL...Amen

                    YES... he has a plan already... unless no one has noticed that he can allow UN troops to act within our borders without FBI oversight now. ANOTHER "CHANGE" that no one seems to have caught in to yet.! "Inspectors from 3rd world countries monitoring OUR elections" would be the "writing on the wall."

                    And over the last couple of years Obama has had many departments buying millions of rounds of hollow point bullets. This man has to go. I believe he will put our country in the hands of the UN and they will come in also.

                    Upaces,Your right it will get nasty in America,on the 6th,7th!That's what I'm concerned about I have family in the states!
                    <br/>
                    Which ever side comes out the victor!I'm afraid that the other side will riot if G-d forbid Obama,wins enough.Americans are extremely angry that they will riot on the other,hand if Romney/Ryan win!
                    <br/>
                    Then Obama supporters will riot because there hero lost,they will feel.That they will not be getting what they deserve!Only one problem with that thinking when the government runs out,of money what then!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So either way on the night of November 6th,day of November 7th!I do not see it being real good for America!

                  The military has the American peoples back and will not let Obama become a dictator. They take an oath to defend our constitution I think. Obama is the lowest creature, I try to feel sorry for him but can't even muster that after what he has done to my beloved country. He is a dangerous man and will be even more so after he loses and knows he has nothing to lose. May God help us all!

                    I haven't made it clear what side I'm on? Are you kidding me? Nice to see that you've seen me around, I've posted over 300 posts on this site. Ask anyone on this site and they'll tell you what side I'm on.

                    Read your post that prompted Jaclyn to call you an uneducated fool and you will see just how she misinterpreted what you were bringing out. All I was trying to do is explain to her what you really were trying to get across. I know you are a conservative !! My posts are scattered all over the place on different comments.

                  You need to actually read the article. If you did, you'd have known what I meant. BTW I have yet to take a "government dollar" for ANYTHING. Can you say the same? I doubt it, because if you did read my post post and couldn't understand it like the 60+ people that have liked it, you're the one that is the uneducated fool.

              I like how quickly Romney took obummers revenge comment and used it against obummer. obummer is getting as bad as biden with his remarks. I just hope that Romney and Ryan have good secret service protection. Somehow I don't trust these dummicrats out there making threats. I hope the Romney team has secret service watching every move at the WH too. What's going on there? Sorry, after the last four years, I don't trust any of them.

                  Jaclyn, there are many of us that know how to dish out punishment in a sever way that the ones doing the threatning  can't imagine.and we are conservatives that believe in  our great nation so don't worry about "if" obama loses, just make sure you vote to make him lose !!

                  And Obama is inciting this violence.  Let's see if he leaves the WH if he loses. The Dems will file lawsuits over fraud in voting, though it is theirs, and he will say he won't leave until it has all run its course. Then his Supremen Court will back him.

                    And it's the dummicrats that say we don't need photo ID to vote. Maybe the reason is so they CAN file lawsuits of voter fraud. I wonder what they say about Ms. Stevens who had to vote three times to get her vote for Romney to register. And, like I said before, I wonder if the final count on that voting situation was 2 for obummer and 1 for Romney. Somehow I don't trust obummer and his Chicago machine. I wonder why! Go Romney ~Ryan!!

                    Totally agree.  If she did not hit for it to register then it would  not have counted three and if she had she could not have voted again, at least not in most places. Go Romney and Ryan is right!!!

                A report came out today saying the secret service is simply ignoring the threats against Romney and Ryan.  Wonder who gave that directive?  Mitt is smart and I believe he has hired a personal security detail.  He loves his family too much to leave it in the hands of a two bit government.

                  I certainly won't. No pun intended, folks. The Progressive academics who write the history books will whitewash his record more than they did Bill Clinton's.

                Sorry, but history books up to now are showing the following as some sort of heroes.
                <br/>
                Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Roman Armies......they were nothing but aggressive murderous bullies. History books still show Columbus as the discoverer of America, when we all know, that the Norsemen were here a thousand years ahead.
                <br/>
                Obama will probably be shown as a really nice guy, with beautiful teeth , a black who made good. Mark my words.

                  The Commie Teachers Union will make him out to be some kind of JFK &amp; want a statue of him next to Martin Luther King who deserved one! Obama already is a murderous bully, just look at the US Embassy in Libya! 4 Americans dead, it should have been 35 or so except for some heroic Navy Seals that saved 30+ lives! Also they call him AfricanAmerican, his father is NOT of slave heritage no matter how much they lie! And that has nothing to do with birth certicate.

                    Well, the African part IS correct.....his father was from Kenya, and technically, his mother was American. This STILL doesn't make him a citizen, automatically. Especially, since the matter of his actual birth place still is cloudy! There are stories of him claiming Indonesian citizenship, and stating so on educational waivers to get free education assistance from the U.S. government!

                    With an American mom, he's pretty easily a citizen, but with a non-American Dad he's definitely NOT a Natural Born Citizen as required by the Constitution.  He's not the President, but rather the pResident.

                    I agree with you about the Commie Teachers Union, but why do you say King deserved a statue?  He was a stinking communist himself and had the likes of Jesse Jackson as one of his main lieutenants.  I don't know why people believe this b.s. about King being some sort of hero.  Maybe in Moscow, Beijing or Havana they, or at least the communist govt. would consider him a "hero".

                    We need another national holiday.  Let;s call it "James Earl Ray" day.  Ray did a great public service.  King was a rabble rousing, womanizer, communist, progressive SOB! We need that holiday.

                    I couldn't agree more.  King was the scum of the earth.  He was supported by black militant trash.  Even Jackie Kennedy had no use for him and strongly suspected him to be a rabble rousing con artist, which surprised me considering the way the Kennedys and their spouses have always been left wing Democrats.  I guess Jackie had more sense than most of them.  Nowadays the feds and the academics teach that King was this big hero in the left wing propaganda public schools and universities.  Of course this is nothing but another liberal lie.  Anybody who cares enough to find out the truth about King realizes that he was little more than a trouble making communist who used racial strife to help in the long range plan to destroy this country.

                    Just to bring you toads up to date, Communism died in Moscow on Christmas Day in 1991. It had been tested over many decades and utterly discredited as a viable method of organizing a nation's economy. You guys are just poking at its ghost.

                    You're a fool if you believe that Murphy.  Communism is alive and well.  It goes by the alias "Democrat Party" nowadays in the U.S.  Different name, but the same thing Lenin, Stalin, Mao and the rest of the tinpot dictators forced or fooled their countrys into falling for.

                    I've come to the realization that the only ones who think like you are either the useful idiots who will be done away with sooner or later by the communist feds or the scum who will have something to gain once the communist feds have destroyed the economy to the point where martial law is enacted due to the worthless dollar and chaos reigning in the Godless, moralless society they've had a large hand in creating.  Which group are you a member of?

                    Not only the media is to blame.  Hollywood and the rest of the so called entertainment industry along with what passes for the public education school system and the govt. supported universities are to blame for the propaganda too.

                    If who is supposed tp be his father is actually his father then he is not eligible to hold the office Of POTUS. I wonder if we will ever know for sure anything about him.  Maybe if enough of us Americans raise enough noise about him they will be forced into finding out.  Oops I forgot we are put numbered by his minions

                    @GW1775, I agree with you on your Columbus remark.  Army of 69 was technically correct that the Vikings/ Norsemen were here long before Columbus, but there was no specific individual or written record to credit those who first came to our shores.
                    <br/>
                    I also agree that the truth needs to come out about Oblamao,but it may be a long time coming.
                    <br/>
                    The use of voter intimidationa and fraud shows how desperate he is to stay in power and finish destroying our country.

                    Amerigo Vespucci was the chief navigator of Spain who claimed a vast continent existed. He made 2 confirmed trips to "The New World" after the voyage of Columbus. In 1507 a cosmographer making a map including the American continent gave it the name America, the feminized form of Amerigo because he felt it should be named after a woman like Europa and Asia. America had numerous occupants (apparently even some who carved Hebrew inscriptions on rocks of the 10 commandments found in a dry creek bed in New Mexico possibly dating to 1000 BC) before it was "discovered" by Europeans and was given a Europeanized  history.

                    Columbus was actually searching for a shorter route to the Far East. When he landed, Columbus believed he had found it: he thought he was in the Far East. Vespucci was the person who determined that what Columbus found was not the Far East, but a new continent. America was named after Amerigo in honor of this discovery.

                    The things history books don't tell anymore, would fill mainframe computers to the brim. (Since the computer was discovered by our friend in DC, the Honorable Mr. Gore.) The horror stories the history books never tell is because the indians found here died from our diseases brought here that they had no immunity to, and the rest were victims of "MANIFEST DESTINY." Slavery was another victim of the victor writing history. Hate to say it, but the white man's history if written correctly is very hard to swallow in any form.! We HAVE come a long ways since then, and until 2008, I really felt bad about it. Guess it's our turn to have our history written after this next term if Obama wins. This will truly be dark if this happens, and I for one truly hope I don't have to bear witness to it happening. America has grown to be truly a world ICON, but is in progress of being reduced to rubble by those with hidden agendas and hatred for it. (Oby, Nancy, Harry, Michelle)...
                    <br/>
                    Cherish this country, and vote for those who would protect and defend her, the alternative is an outcome that historians will have one hell of a time writing correctly.

                    Yeah, these clowns said the Holocaust didn't happen. That's why General Dwight D. Eisenhower  said he wanted it intensly photographed, so we wouldn't forget, and people like BHO clowns couldn't erase it.

                    Slavery was brought here with the early settlers from Europe. Remember King George was in favor of slavery. In 1776 after the revelutionary war several states abolished slavery this lead to the Civil War. Of course in 1960 our history books were rewritten and most early history is mistaught.

                    One fact that is almost NEVER mentioned is that it was Arabic slave traders in Africa that sold the slaves to the slave ship owners from the US and England. Today, Arabic slave traders STILL buy and sell black slaves in some African states at large public auctions...

                    Please reread your pre 1960 History books it was the Dutch that mainly brought slaves to Americas shores.  Many oif the slaves sold into slavery were by their own people, tribe or by whatever waring tribe captured them

                    On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, which declared "that all persons held as slaves" within the rebel states "are, and henceforward shall be free." The proclamation also called for the recruitment and establishment of black military units among the Union forces. An estimated 180,000 African Americans went on to serve in the army, while another 18,000 served in the navy.States rights and slavery.

                    Slavery was not an "american invention. Slavery had and still does exist in the middle east since before Christ and was rampantly used by the Egyptians as a means of forced labor. The history of the 'dark continent' is rift with slavery and it was black's selling other black's to dutch traders that started bringing them here. Get your history of slavery right

                    Yep. That's the way it works on web sites like this. Independently verifiable facts don't count for much... but you can simply declare anything to be true, and it is, no matter how farfetched.

                    Exactly. Now that the election is over, I think the lesson is that LIES can't be used to win. Too many people figure them out, and turn on you. Think of them all... "Muslim"... "Marxist"... "Communist"... born in Kenya... not eligible... "sealed" his records... massive conspiracy with the UN...

                    It's all laughable. And what a bunch of buffoons. It did nothing for their so-called "cause." Absolutely nothing. What a pity.

                    Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of North America range from 2 million to a high of 18 million, with around 7 million seeming fairly well-supported. Estimates of native population decrease after contact range from 40 to a high of 80 percent. Again, somewhere in the middle is likely. This decrease occurred over a range of almost four centuries. Modern populations of surviving native groups are at or above estimated pre-European populations. To try to lump everyone living on the continent before Columbus into one group called "Native Americans" is fallacious, as there were many distinct peoples, ranging from the Aztec Empire to the Chumash. Every group had its own history of relations with governments of European settlers which cannot be reduced to "white people came and killed everybody." The results of exposure to new diseases is merely a fact of biology. Europeans died from them first, and the native peoples gave Europeans syphilis and possibly some other diseases as well. There is only one known instance of anyone deliberately using smallpox-infected blankets to make Indians sick.

                    That's only one THEORY about syphilis. To buy it completely disregards evidence to the contrary.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Most scholars believe its symptoms were described by Hippocrates in Classical Greece in its venereal/tertiary form. There are other suspected syphilis findings for pre-contact Europe, including at a 1314th century Augustinian friary in the northeastern English port of Kingston upon Hull.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This city's maritime history, with its continual arrival of sailors from distant places, is thought to have been a key factor in the transmission of syphilis.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Carbon-dated skeletons of monks who lived in the friary showed bone lesions that are typical of venereal syphilis, although this is disputed by critics of this theory.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Skeletons in pre-Columbus Pompeii and Metaponto in Italy with damage similar to that caused by congenital syphilis have also been found.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, and other supporters of this idea say that many medieval European cases of leprosy, colloquially called ''lepra'', were actually cases of syphilis.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Syphilis probably cannot be "blamed"as it often ison any geographical area or specific race. The evidence suggests that the disease existed in both hemispheres from prehistoric times.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is only coincidental with the Columbus expeditions that the syphilis previously thought of as "lepra" flared into virulence at the end of the fifteenth century.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    John Lobdell and Douglas Owsley wrote that a European writer who recorded an outbreak of "lepra" in 1303 was "clearly describing syphilis." This theory is supported by genetic studies of venereal syphilis and related bacteria, which found an intermediate disease between yaws and syphilis in Guyana, South America.

                    Actually columbus landed on on of the islands in the carrebean, not in america. The nores were here thousand yrs before as evidenced in the northern parts of America. Columbus and his clowns finally found the mainland quite bit later with other transatlantic crossings

                  The winners write the history books.  Once Obama is removed from office we need to push to have him prosecuted for his innumerable crimes against the Constitution.  Let's see them white-wash 30 years in prison.

                    Prison? Try the Alabama Country Club! That is the nickname of a federal "prison" at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. It is a prison designed for politicians BY politicians. Several years ago one network news agency did a story about Maxwell. Here's some of their findings:
                    <br/>
                    1. "Prisoners" live in large cottages, not individual cells.
                    <br/>
                    2. Each cottage has multiple telephone lines with free, unlimited long distance.
                    <br/>
                    3. Prisoners families have the option of living with them.
                    <br/>
                    4. Prisoners perform know duties such as KP, trash collection, etc.
                    <br/>
                    5. Prisoners have complete access to prison grounds at all times.
                    <br/>
                    6. Meals are prepared by gourmet chefs, not standard cafeteria cooks.
                    <br/>
                    7. Library and recreational facilities for the prison are better than for the law abiding members of the military and their dependents on the other side of the base.
                    <br/>
                    Time in one of these facilities is not a prison sentence: It is a free pass to Club Med.
                    <br/>
                    .
                    <br/>

                    Not true anymore.  Communists write the history books and parents give their kids to them just to get rid of them.  The Communists brainwash the kids... and then Communism wins.   Public school is Hell's toilet on earth.

                    30 yrs does not come close to fitting his crimes. To me it is more like 4 consecutive life sentences with no possibility of parole. may his bones rot in hell along side his commie mentors and saul alinsky rules for radicals plans.

                  This is why impeachment procedings should be started as soon as the election is over.  Boehner doesn't have the guts for it because he doesn't want to be demonized, but he should remember that it isn't about him.  It is right to make this historical correction and paint the colors true!

                    Just like every other "invasion" in human history, the European settlement of the Americas was inspired by pressure exerted on the "invaders'" home. In this case, the expansionist Muslims invaded and captured Christian and Jewish lands in the Mideast, finally ending up with the fall of Constantinople, which blocked off European land-trade routes to Asia, inspiring the search for new sea routes to Asia -- hence, Columbus' voyages. America just happened to be in the way.

                    Actually it was the Inuets of Alaska that wee here before the better known Native Americans.  However, it was the Chinese who were actually the first to "discover" America as is indicated by artifacts found along the California coast.

                  I hear you. The Muslims are working hard to make good on Obama's claim that America is not historically Christian, but rather Muslim, by claiming that Muslim jihadis took time off from ravaging North Africa and Europe in order to discover the Mississippi River during the Dark Ages.

                  The Chinese were here before the Norsmen.  Artifacts along the California coast have been dated to at least 600 years before the earliest Norse artifacts.

                  Columbus was a great man, and the modern history books hate him.  It's true the Norsemen were here before him (and probably also Saint Brendan) but frankly the Norsemen didn't know where they were, and were certainly not trying to cross an ocean as Columbus knew he was.

                    God will bless America again- only if we repent as a nation and turn back to God. Even though over 60 % of the population is against the slaughter of innocent babies, we are still allowing it to happen,that means the blood of those innocent babies is on our hands.We need to become as vocal as the tree huggers who have stopped the exploration of oil and gas in our country just to save a titmouse.The same holds true with same gender marriage.

                <br/>
                away from public view.    the Republicas did not press the issue nor bring it up and
                <br/>
                there is no excuse allowed.     Out only hope in all parties is vote out all who were
                <br/>
                incumbent the first time aroudn and contiue to remove them from office till they realize

                    There have been cases reported here in Houston of voter intimidation, In OHIO and Nevada there have been cases reported of voting machines
                    <br/>
                    switching votes.   But like most of the Liberal mindset like yourself these
                    <br/>
                    will never be reported nor will they be invetigated.  In the last election
                    <br/>
                    there was voter intimidatio by the black pussecats in Chi town but
                    <br/>
                    not investigated.  There are numerous reportings that are ignored all
                    <br/>
                    to try and sway the vote to regain the fool in the White House.   Even
                    <br/>
                    mental giantgs like yourself will eventually have to wake up and face
                    <br/>
                    reality but by then it will  be to late and you along with others will face
                    <br/>

                Only if WE make sure they do!! This is one of the things that "We the People" need to look at. The education system in our country was quietly taken over by liberals and they are raising your children to be "Good little liberals"! If you would read a current 8th grade history book on WWII today, you would be in shock! They spend more time on the internment of the Japanese people in America, than they do on the entire war in Europe! They spend more time on the Atomic bombs and their effect on the Japanese people, than they do on the entire Pacific War &amp; the battles faught! We have alot of work to do people, I am talking about AFTER we remove obama from office. Our children should be taught the whole truth of our history, not only the things that many think are "Bad about America"!!

                  Gator ,   You are right on brother. It is a masive task for us to undertake but look at the alternative.It will be well worth it.We need to become the Tea Party to the 100th power.Just a massive wave of conservatism,so that we can take back our country and restore it to what the founding fathers meant it to be.

                Cindykat, start practicing with your protection, just in case you have to use it to save your life.  You want to shoot the real threat and not some bystander by accident.

                  #3 or #4 buck - pellets are still big enough to do some damage and small enough that there are a bunch more of them than with 00 buck.

                  My favorite "in-home" defense weapon is a Mossberg 20ga pump, full magazine, loaded with as many 2-3/4" #3s as I can get in her - then the 1911 w/ 5 mags comes out.

                    Actually 7 1/2 shot works really well at the close range inside a home and does max damage close up because of all the little holes !! Also it is less likely to do collateral damage in other rooms because of wall penetration. I still like the #4 buck chased by some 00 since i have a 9 shot 870 Remington (my doing on this one !!) I love the 1911 A1 overall but opted for an Israeli made .41 AE Jericho (actually called a 941 and you can switch barrel and spring and shoot 9MM also  because of the way the shell base is made on the .41AE. The .41AE is hard to find ammo but I have neat 1000 rds of it split between 200 gr. FMJ and 180 gr, Gold Dot Hollow point) That's just the right at hand stuff. If I reach back a little, out comes the Ruger Mini-30 with several 30 rd mags plus some 20 rd mags.

                A year and a half ago I moved to a very secluded location where I can almost spit across the Canadian border.  A little cold in the winter, but firewood is cheap.  I hope all of you living close the nations tallest buildings stay safe.  I fear there will be riots either way..."punishing" us for not re-electing the Mesiah...of celebrating and knowing Holder will make sure there are no prosecutions.  God help the USA!!!

                  Near the Canadian border is a safe place to be.  I'm not far from there myself.  I've been here almost 10 years now and I'm sure glad I got out of California.  I can handle the cold weather but not those crazy people in CA!

              Obama and his Cronies in his campaign know this is the only way they can possibly win, so they cheat at every opportunity and intimidate at every turn.  Liberals haven't changed their behaviour in years.  If they don't like what's going on, they take their toys and leave!  Exceptin this case they have nowhere to go, so behaving like idiots suit them.

              In my few decades of exposure to Intimadation and veiled Threats, I have learned to 'seemingly' ignore them although they are readily recorded in memory and responsive measures designed. And yes, sometimes the best response is strategic withdrawal.
              <br/>
              Although I have already voted based upon what has been proven to me in the past 4 years, I and mine do intend on visiting my local polling site to determine if innocents &amp;/or docile require any assist or defense in performing their Right and Duty. Afterward those who think they can take or destroy that which is not theirs will be initially delivered the message "Come and Take It" supported with strong defensive measures. But then again, I am not locally surrounded and outnumbered by such animals.

              If you want to riot then riot. You only burn down your own infrasture. It's your stores,cars, homes etc. When it is all said and done it doesn't change a thing. Only hurting yourselves. However, if you come after me and my family prepare for the worst. You may want to make your final arragements

                  Let them tear up everything they have &amp; DON'T REBUILD IT under ANY circumstances!  Let them spend their own "O'Dumbo money" to try to fix it themselves &amp; see how that goes.  MAYBE they won't be as quick to tear it up the next time they have one of their juvenile delinquent entitlement spoiled brat temper tantrums!  If they HAD to WORK for everything THEY have, maybe they wouldn't be so eager to tear up OTHER people's stuff or at least wouldn't have TIME to do so!  Never mind!  They'd probably just move to a place they hadn't torn up yet!

                  Boy!  Did you ever hit THAT nail right on the head..."stupid Americans"!  I've just about had a stroke listening to all the brain dead morons &amp; trying to rationalize how 50% of this country could be ignorant enough to buy O'Dumbo's bald faced lies &amp; even THINK about re-electing the imposter!  All the states that are going down the toilet keep voting for the same idiots expecting different results!  That's the definition of INSANITY!

              If they choose to burn it down, they can rebuild it themselves.    Places like NYC, Philly, Boston, Newark, Jersey City are some of the most corrupt in the history of this country.  If they were burnt down, greater cities without the welfare kings and queens would rise.  The police are coopted in these towns, so they will just "stand down", not unlike the "Heroes" of Bengazi who could have saved 4 Americans.in Libya.  If this happens, and these people wind up displacing themselves, I guess we can blame it on .......Global Warming.

              whether this fool gets back in or not immediately after the election he and his wife need to go to jail for fraud, their fate should be that of the rosenburgs, they are traitors to America. shame on us for letting this happen but it isnt to late to rectify the situation. either way!

              Ahh the pretender in chief strikes again. God willing he wont declare martial law after he loses the election. I have already voted by mail ( WA.) but unfortunatley was cancelled out by my Obama loving daughter. One can only hope for a Romney win.

              If the law enforcement has any "brass" they will take every one of those threats and arrest them for conspiracy to harm a Presidential candidate or to riot. Both are against the law.

              I don't care how you look at it the out come is dire., If he wins America as we know will be no more, if he loses he still has 2 months to do us in. He can declare martial law and if not that he will do all in his power to destroy us before he is finished. If JESUS CHRIST does not act very soon there will be much suffering in this country.There lies our only hope.

              They want to riot? That's fine. We have at least some police who still believe in the law and equal rights. They want to come after me, and others like me ? That's fine too.They had better be ready for a citizen who will be prepared to assert his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

              what bill maher said is definitely a violation of the voters intimidation act, whether he said it in the context of a joke or not. can you imagine what would happen if any white person said, "jokingly", if you're thinking about voting for obama, i would like to make this one plea: white people know who you are and they will come after you.  the secret service, homeland security anf the f.b.i. would storm your house and throw you in jail.
             </p>
             <p>
              there certainly is a great deal of racism in america, but most of this racism comes from the racist liberals like maher and the racist blacks who hate white americans.

              He has been asking for backup if he is elected and well he should.  Someone might want to take a poke at his fanny with real intent in mind to pay for all he has cost the country and the citizens in the last four year.  His own may disown him for failing them with the great give away program.  You gotta go MR. Obama, You have never been a real president so I for one have always refused to call you by that name.  I may be no good with the sword but I can still speak my mind and YUO, Obama, seek revenge against a man who is honest, truthful, law abiding, kind husband and father, YOU, a man who tells few truths, don't know the word honest, have not abided by any laws that we can find yet, and husband, that is still under investigation. I call that sour grapes from someone who is lazy, jealous because you have not learned how to work, really work, anti-american by your own words in your books and talks before taking office and some after.  You gotta to, MR, Obama.  You have welded the racist theme too long and people now realize, that is fake, just like you.  You gotta go, Obama!!

              Using the word "revenge" was "CODE" for "take your places"!  He is sending the message to the thugs, criminals, radicals, rebels, Foreign and Domestic Factions who HATE America and all we stand for!  And they are standing by!  A Country functioning on "revenge" instead of "repair" is destined to crash!   We, as Conservatives, are at fault for being complacent, accepting, over-looking, and allowing Washington to "function" (?) behind our backs!  We assume that because the "carcass" looks intact, the "vital organs" in our Nations body is safe!  We have been dooped in, pooped on, and it is OUR fault!  Tuesday is our last chance to begin to recover!  Do we really want the venomous, vitriolic, rhetoric, divisive, and anti-American, usurper to finish what he started four years ago?

              Recently I talked with various people that suggested that bush during his 8 years raised the debt to nearly 8 trillion dollars...no I said that is since 1776 our debt had raised to 8 trillion dollars..since then in 2008-2012 Obama by his own hand raised the Debt as much in his 4 years as all of those than ran before him!! Obama by his own hand raised the debt by $8 trillion dollars...and took all other Presidents 300 (three hundred) plus years to spend the first 8 trillion! So in Obama's own words..."Let's Be Clear"...Are We Clear About This??
             </p>
             <p>
              But hey it was Bush who caused all of this..Obama was in the Senate and He alone was the Force behind ACORN!! So again, "Let's Be Clear About This"...are we Clear or am I going to fast for anyone to keep up? So now that he has clearly stated..he didn't care about the Economy for the first two years during 2008-2010...because 2010 Americans Replaced Several Democrats for what they Failed to do and pushing Obama care on All Americans and their laws to force every American to buy Health Insurance...leaving Unions to opt out if they are willing to pay a fine...so the Unions will Drop their people in The Auto Industry...since the UAW took Over the Health Care Program in Exchange for a small increase in pay!! So GMC turned over all of the money it had put into a Health Care Fund for Employee retirement, and for GMC general employment Health Care Fund for GMC employees...and the Unions used that Money to get Obama in Office...and now they can spend all that money ion pay increases for themselves!!
             </p>
             <p>
              So we can clearly see how the Unions and the Democrats don't look out for the Low Income and Middle Class people of America...Are We Clear About This??

              He has tried to hide his record for 2 yrs. now but it was a waste of time as its as close as his shadow . Its apparent every where he goes .He hates his opponent and his slip of the tounge just gave leave of what he thought .

              if you riot you die, that would solve some of the debt issue, by lowering the welfare dole. "I am a man! a proud American man!! Can i have a food stamp so I can feed myself?? I say I am a proud American man!!! can someone support me?? cause I am a man!!! So the question is are you a proud welfare recipient, or a proud welfare sponser???  if they do not riot; well it will prove they are not men.

              The hypocrisy if this "rant" is only magnified by its distortion to fact, but also lacks objectivity. It appears to be written by a spiteful child. First, the sheer fact that the writer never mentioned the voter registration fraud the republicans perpetrated in Florida. This only one of several states that are being investigated.  If anyone is guilty of being a "lemming," it's the many readers who subscribe to this dribble. If anyone was sophomoric, it was Myth RobMe at the Olympic's and in Israel. I would also point to RobMe moronic statements about Chrysler building Jeeps in China... if anyone ran a lousy campaign, it was Romney... another Bush clone..

              I guess Obama is talking about revenge because his performance during all three debates was miserable.
              <br/>
              Furthermore he will remembered as the President of confrontation: blacks vs whites, rich vs poor, workers vs union workers, Tea Party vs OWS, Christians vs Muslims, legals vs illegals, GOP vs women, Obamacare vs Medicare, Obama vs Seals, the stupid police vs a black Professor, the latino vs a guy who would look like his son, We The People vs Obama's regime, small businesses vs government, green energy vs coal and oil, fiscal responsibility vs crazy spending, building vs regulations, truth vs lies..............

              Career criminal. That's why I fully expect Obama to steal the election through fraud - he has a history of fraud. Why would he stop being a criminal when it comes to the election?

              I completely agree with everything the author, Tad Cronn, said in this article. And if the liberal, progressive, pro-socialism, pro-Islam individuals who threatened violence if Romney wins want violence, let's give it to them: arrest everyone who voted for Obama and hang them for treason.

              Only enemies of the Constitutional Republic will vote for Obama. Voting for Obama therefore makes said voter my enemy. If there are enough of you to put this POS back in office again be prepared to face the revolution and my sights!

              This is a hoot!  Notice how WE rioted when this loser was foisted on us with the help of a compliant media.  Poor little whiners, suck their thumb &amp; moan &amp; cry if they don't get their way.  The National Guard has the answer to their threats of rioting.  It's an M-16 with a bayonet on the end, inviting the perps to a free one way trip to jail!

              So ... Let the riots begin.  80 MILLION Patriot gun owners are very willing and able to defend themselves if need be.  Consevatives are not violent people but they will defend themselves if necessary.  Liberals are violent because they have absolutely nothing else going for them and thus need to make threats and if enough of them are together, then become violent because none of them have the intestinal fortitude to be violent on their own.  Well ... unless they are drugged up that is.

              Don't try the RIOT gig people. This country is not that type. The riots of the past were done by DERANGED, AIR HEADED JUVENILE CRIMINALS! Those riots didn't solve a thing. It only put deranged things in jail. If push comes to shove, i suggest that the old military riot control methods be employed. Loaded rifles and bayonets. Worked real well.

              The pic on the front page here that lead me to read on makes Obama look crazier than Joe B on a bad day.....Seriously with unanimous support of retired veterans....would anyone really want to tick off a retired veteran? This would be a very painful suicide for some,if not all...I've heard that a mad marine could make Cujo look like a cute puppy.

              Let's not forget that Obama was diagnosed with a mental health disorder by the psychological community: specifically narcissistic personality disorder.  In a nutshell, the symptoms range from extremely elevated sense of grandiosity, inordinate need for worship and adulation, never taking responsibility for anything, every thought, deed, and action is centered on self and only self.  The downside for this aberration is that this diagnosis comes with an extraordinarily brittle ego which when threatened or more importantly when the adulation and elevated position end, then whole persona can come unglued and decline precipitously.  Whose revenge is he talking about?  Quite frankly, his own.  Any truly together and caring president would never pit one group of people against another in an obviously destructive way. It is a shame that the abandonment issues in his childhood and the coddling and absence of accountability in his adulthood have precipitated the mental depravity he suffers from, but that doesn't mean he is either qualified nor fit for the presidency.  Certainly, one can only hope that the violence that he is fomenting will not come to pass and that if Romney wins that Obama himself will get the psychological help he needs to overcome the deficiencies of his mental state before its too late.

I WISH EVERYONE OF YOU KNOW GOD WILL DEAL ALL LIARS, THIEVES, AND ALL ILLS, TRUST IN THE LORD, ETC.  I SAW THROUGH THE PRESIDENT BY THE WAY HE WAS MAKING SPEECHES WHEN HE CAMPAIGNED THE FIRST TIME.  I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE AND HEAR FROM AND ALL THOSE WHO ENTITLEMENTS.  AS GOD  SAYS, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING, PRAY FOR EVERYTHING," AND WATCH HOW HE WORKS.

              We all know what these liberals have done in 2008 and in the current campaign.  Now we have these imbeciles trying to threaten us with violence.  Are you kidding me?  There isn't a combat vet I know who feels threatened by these ignorant people, if that's what they can be called.  Bring it on fools.  You will know what real pain feels like.

              It has been reported that new gun sales are in the millions.  I would suspect that the people that are buying  these guns are the very ones that intend to use them on the people that are threatening all of the violence should Obama lose this election.  I didn't have to buy any new guns.  I already had mine and I fully intend on protecting my family and property!

              "Revenge" ........it's a funny word to bring up now. The end of slavery in 1865, the "south" way of racial behavior, Martin Luther King and HIS DREAM. Sounds like the Demon party is looking to "stir up" some kind of trouble..........."Burn Baby Burn"......"Honky".............when will the simmering end? If winning an election can't be done with honor and truth, then "turn" the voters against each other............the "whackos" will surely "pop up"........I hope it's very small in number.

              We must be fearless against the hateful left. If we want our country back, we can't bow down to their tyranny. They're losing and they know it. Don't let them win!

              He certainly looks insane in the picture accompanying this article. Looks a lot like Hitler. If I believed in reincarnation, I would believe he is Hitler..He is evil through and though and an alcoholic as well. How may presidents have brewed their own beer. Does he roll his own tobacco too. Does Michelle grow it in her garden for him and dry it in the basement?

              There are books and magazine articles written by conservatives telling the truth about Obama.  If everyone who feels the truth will be covered up by the liberals in the future would buy a book or two, and save some magazine articles, our children and grandchildren could read the truth in years to come.

              Start a riot, go ahead, make my day. Heck,...make my year,...make my decade because I'll get to use all those tools I've been buying since Obomaumau was nominated the first time. I can now reach out and touch you from a thousand yards away.

              Don't know about the rest of the country, but here in Texas, we're locked and loaded.  Liberal considering riots should tread VERY carefully here! Many people have concealed permits, especially, in the wake of the insane who have run riot and killed, such as the Waco cafeteria, and the Ft. Hood situation! And Bill Maher should think twice about visiting Texas, if ever!!

              I believe that ACORN is still receiving tax money and remember they had many, many names. I do not believe they are not alive and well.  Remember the guy in 2008 whio said he had voted 87 times?. Never in my 75 years have I seen anything like 2008 and 2012. It's just pure evil and we need to know that it is bigger then the United States that we are fighting against. It's all about the destruction of America.  Created crisises to keep us from zeroing in on the truth. Deaths abnd threats to keep everyone in line.  This is just the beginning if Obama wins again.

              The prince of fools was elected by the mass of fools who bought into the hype and hoopla cult of personality that bought the office for him. 'Hope and change' turns to Marxist and maniac.

              If you have not yet early voted and must wait until Tuesday, be advised to be ALERT as you cast your vote on the electronic machines. There have been reports in EVERY KEY STATE that the machines have been showing votes intended for Romney posting as to 0bama. Some show up right when you select Romney, others on the final verification page. PAY ATTENTION!
             </p>
             <p>
              Strangely enough, not one incident of votes for 0bama turning up in Romneys column. How 'bout that.

              Well.... IF they are coming after me for Voting against a coward for abandoning the men under his command, I guess they will let me know so I can give them my address. I may not think Romney has the best to offer since I am very conservative, But I DO believe he respects this country, will serve it respectfully (yes he loves the flag too) and will not sit and watch his men die and not lift a finger so he can cover his claims for the election. Al Quaeda IS ALIVE AND WELL, contrary to what Obama says, just ask the Ambassador and three seals who paid the high price to prove it.! Obama is DEFINITELY the bottom of the barrel for choices, and ANYONE but him is getting my vote if they are a legitimate candidate and not one who wrote themselves in on the Colorado Ballots. Anything to split the vote and steal the election again. Acorn is not dead either.!

              The fact that Dem.s resort to "strongarm tactics" only shows their true Ignorance! I hope that people will keep the video cameras handy and document any form of intimidation they see. We must not allow any threats to deter us from removing obama from our house in DC, Our children &amp; grandchildren deserve a chance in this world! Stand up, do not allow anyone to suppress your vote. Think of all those that have dies to protect your right to vote, we cannot allow their deaths to be in vain!

              The only revenge that I show Barack is by voting for Romney and Ryan.   My neighbor has a rottweiler that can protect me from any harms done by losing Obama's supporters. Obama should cry for civility from  his own donors.

              obama's followers don't know anything else but threats.  after all they are evil.    so are so many people who believe him it is a sin.    I for one believe in romney.   He is so down to earth and I feel he is telling the truth.  I do not see this in obama.  he is promising the world again, but I know he will never ever pull it off.  he just wants to win that is all.  he may have hit men burn cities and try to murder romney.  I would not put a pass to this.  the people who follow him still think they will get everything for nothing and do not want to lose that chance by voting romney in.      too bad they will be disappointed again as obama just says what he knows they want to hear, but does not mean it.    he wants to be a dictator, I want to live in free society,  I do not want anyone but God to tell me when I have to die, God forbid, I should get an illness that could kill me.  who is he to say whether our life is worth saving or not.:?  who is he to allow woman to murder unborn babies just because they don't know enough that sex if not protected can lead to a pregnancy.  instead of condoning murder, why don't they steriized these woman because their sex drive is greater than their ability to be real mothers.  we need medicare to stay solvent.  we don't need other taxes added to our burdens.   we need Romney and God back in out lives and that of the country.  all you obama lovers and followers out there, the devil has you right where he wants you.   He will not give you anything for nothing,  he will not let you keep your amnesty this is just a ploy to get your votes, don't you know this by now?   go ahead and vote for him, but do not cry on my shoulder when he disappoints you again.  it will be your own fault for believing the devil.    God Bless aMerica and may we always be free, not run under a muslim.  remember all of you should he come in again, this may be your last christmas to celebrate as he wants this country to be muslim.and we will not be able to pray to our one and only God, we will be forced to pray to allah and will be punished should we refuse. that goes for you atheists too.  mark my words.

              The only way the secret service would be trying to track down a threat is if is was againt king obama. All these people threatening riots and such just can't stand the idea that their Welfare and Food Stamps might be cut and they night have to find a job.

              This article states exactly what I was talking to my children about on the way home this evening.  It is not the behavior of a president.  It is the behavior of a petulant, hollow little man.  I thought:  Revenge?  For what???  I also think that a person who is seeking the office of the president to appeal to the masses to be calm and to act in a rational behavior.  If white people, regardless of their political party had made threats against Obama before the election in 2008, they would have been arrested.  Obama just encourages this type of behavior.  He should be put to a firing squad.  He is a traitor, a fraud and a miserable excuse for a human being.

              Anytime a group of idiots  just try to destroy the American people, the American people will always use their right to bare arms and keep America safe from being overthrown by people that DO NOT LIKE FREEDOM like OBAMA and His Marxist Socialist Progressive Liberal Democrat people that want to take every right the American people has away. That is why they HATE CONSTITUTION and will try to tell you it is out of date and needs to be done away with because bit keeps THEM AT BAY.

              It won't surprise me if there isn't a civil war regardless who wins.  I'm a conservative republican but some of the rhetoric I'm hearing on this side tells me conservatives are locked and loaded.  Honestly this is ridiculous and didn't have to go that way but for 4 years all we've heard is we're racist because we don't like Obama's socialist policies.  I for one thought those days of racism were long gone but keep poking and your bound to tick someone off because they're just tired of being poked.

              In the last debate Obama said he was raised by a single mom.  That being the case she never married Obama Sr. then she can not claim his name legally.  Saying that tells me he don't have a birth Certificate.  That is why he spent millions to hide his records.  He admited to colleges as a foriegn student.  What does that tell you folks.

                Some mom. She was an M&amp;S slut, and couldn't bring herself to mothering Obumber. She and her parents were all Commies. This would go along way to explaining Obama's deep seated physiological problems. He's a thin skinned narcissist. Everything is about him.  He's a very small, hate filled bi-sexual reject!

                He needs to tell us who his real daddy is. I don't believe it's the goat herder as he professes. No resemblance what so ever. Maybe the commie Frank Marshal Davis.
                <br/>
                Perhaps Malcolm-X. Check out pictures of Obama and Malcolm-X. Look at the pictures of Obama's daughter and Malcolm-X's daughter. Striking similarities. Looks like a strong DNA match.

              This is absolutely the worst president in our great nations history. The most unAmerican god hating, immoral, corrupt politicians to sit in the highest office of the land. I have to believe that the majority of the people in this great nation do not like him or his character and will vote accordingly on Tuesday. I pray that voter fraud on a grand scale is not used by him to stay in office. Besure when you vote that the machines are registering Romney before you cast your vote because the machines are switching to Obama before you vote. Be sure your right.

              Marxist like obama are trained in how to bring about anarchy.  It is necessary in order to shove The Boot of Marxism down on the throat of freedoms, liberties, and Constitution.  America is at the tipping point.  No doubt the regime will have Eric Holder slammimg the hammer down on any and all close polling areas.  Get ready for obama to install Marshal Law.  He is now allowing the Black Panther Party to "oversee" some polling locations.  Get ready people.  It is going to get quite bloody.  The installation of a Marxist State always is that way.

              I think the local digital annex channel for the NBC station broadcast "Wild in the Streets" last weekend. Mature voters will recall that this was a 1969 movie about a teenage president putting everyone over thirty into concentration camps.

              Hey; if they burn down their own neighborhoods lets just hope most are in northern climates.  Last time I checked winter is on the way so maybe they can be left to freeze to death.  Looks like a win/win situation to me!

              Let the damn cities burn! They are greatly populated by the ignorant and biased democrats anyway. I marvel at the Sandy responses. These New England people have voted democrat for decades on end. They've gotten EXACTLY the government they have asked for - and all of a sudden, they don't like it. I won't hold my breath on them learning anything, but maybe they'll start voting smarter.

                Come on Sandy victims. Show some backbone. Vote for Romney. Obumber blows into town and instead of rolling up his sleeves and filling some sandbags, he poses for the photo ops and off he goes to raise even more money.

                I still think a million man armed march on DC is the way to go to get their attention and remind them why we have a second amendment!

                What are they going to do? Arrest everyone? Think not. Just takes courage and steadfastness. Every once in a while the tree of freedom needs to be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants. Sorry, I forgot who originally said that. A true patriot no doubt.

              Remember we need to make some changes, Two of the most after Obummer is gone is We need out of the UN and NATO and we need them out of America. including all there NATO troops now training on our military basses, including our closed bases, We have supported the largest part of the bill on both with our Tax dollars and military. Time for that to end and both used here to protect America, a good use would be to close the southern Border and expel all illegal invaders  also make Anchor babies the citizens of the mothers country as other nations now do!
             </p>
             <p>
              I also believe after the election we need to charge, tried and let a court of law convict Obummer of his many crimes while in office including high treason in the act of giving tax dollar bought guns to the criminals in Mexico and then forcing the border open so the same guns were used to kill American Law men. Then carry out sentence for the crimes convicted in all there severity.

                Don't forget liberals only account for 20% of the population.  They can be infiltrated, disrupted, and destroyed piece by piece. REVENGE is best served cold something that tea-cup ears seems to be ignorant of.

                  Actually, I'd forgotten about him I was thinking more like William Rehnquist who later became a SCOTUS Chief Justice with such deep issues of insecurity that he felt the need to point out his "Chief-ness" with those stupid, garish yellow stripes on his robe.

                 <p>
                  Just to make it official for all those cowardly "True the Vote"rs, 18 USC  594 says, "Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose, or of causing such other person to vote for, or not to vote for, any candidate for the office of President, Vice President, Presidential elector, Member of the Senate, Member of the House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, or Resident Commissioner, at any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing such candidate, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."

              I said this before - since they want to riot if Oboob doesn't win - then we should riot if he does!  At the very least if he does win we should all go to DC and protest Congress to have him impeached and removed for voter fraud, lying to the people, treason and so on and this time we don't leave until we see that lying sob in jail, and his wife can join him for spending all our money.

                  There is a huge difference between stooping to their low level and standing up for our country, our rights and stand fo no more of this.  You stay home and watch if you like.  I am ready to stop asking for permission to have our country back.  Like the saying goes you have to think like a thief to catch a thief.  I don't think continuing in the path that we have for the last four years will work for another four years.  If he gets another 4 - we are done, so what are you staying quite for?

                    FYI: I've already cast my vote with an absentee ballot ( for Romney &amp; Ryan ), so I'm not "staying home and watching".  I'm in no way advocating cowering-yes, if you see fraud, call them out on it, but for goodness' sake, don't go to the level of MoveOn.org or the New Black Panthers. That's all I'm saying.

                    Thank you but I will use whatever term I think is fitting without being censored by you or anyone else.  It is your extreme interpretation that is the issue here not the word "riot" .  Really do you really think that my using that word is going to start a riot - really?

                We don't need to riot. Our style should be more subtle. If you in a position to hire and/or fire in the workplace, do it. Just be subtle and be sure you cover yourself.

              JUST LIKE I HAVE ALWAYS SAID, HE WAS NOT A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER,, HE WAS AND STILL IS, A COMMUNITY AGITATOR!!   HE AGITATES AND STIRS UP HATRED FOR WHITE PEOPLE,, JUST LIKE HIS REVEREND "WRIGHT" ALWAYS DID...  ANY WHITE PERSON THAT VOTES FOR OVOMIT SHOULD JUST LISTEN  TO A FEW OF THE REVEREND WRIGHTS SERMONS,,,  AND REMEMBER OVOMIT ATTENDED HIS CHURCH FOR 20 YEARS, AND DROVE IN HIS CAR LISTENING TO HIS SERMONS ON HATING WHITES...  HE IS A RACIST AND IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM YOU ARE COMMITING SUICIDE... HE WILL EXTERMINATE YOU WITH RATIONED HEALTH CARE, STARVATION WHEN THE NEXT GREAT DEPRESSION OF OVOMIT HITS,AND WHEN YOU FREEZE TO DEATH BECAUSE YOU CAN NO LONGER GET ANY OF THAT NASTY COAL AND HEATING OIL FOR YOUR FURNACE OR ELECTRICITY FROM THOSE NASTY COAL BURNING ELECTRIC GENERATOR PLANTS...

                Islam is hate. It's a gutter religion with no redeeming qualities. What have they contributed to man-kind during the last thousand years. They strap bombs on their children and send them out to blow themselves up along with the innocent. They deny their daughters an education. They ban listening to music and kite flying.etc, etc, etc.
                <br/>
                They live in the stone-age. We should pull out all aid.

               <p>
                Deny them access to our universities, etc. Let them eat their sand and dirt until they scream apologies to the rest of civilized humanity! Then  demand that they publicly execute those so called religious leaders who preach hate and death. Then allow them to eat more sand and dirt.

              OB is the first president that talked like a street person.  well I guess that's what being an activist breeds.  Vengence is one of his ways of dealing with people and situations that oppose him.  He takes all the things that belong to God as his own.  Hmmm, there's something seriously wrong with any person that thinks they are a god.  Just take a look at past history and see what has happened to those who did. ... Mussolini, Franco, Hitler and many others.....where are they, what happened to their countries after they were gone.  Study some history folks, we can't do the right thing for the U.S. if we don't know what the wrong things are.  This is how an Obama type gets into office.

              i find it extremely laughable anytime a know nothing person tries to " scare whitey" with threats of racial wars,  Whites make up 72 % of the AMerican population, blacks make 12-13%,, I say bring it on,, LOL it would be a short concise victory for whitey. LMFAO

                Racial violence will likely not be general, but more a matter of local riots with casualties. The Camp Logan Mutiny in Houston (1917) was racial and whites were murdered before it was quelled.... IIRC, 20 died in the fighting and 19 black soldiers were hanged. Many of us remember the 92 riots in LA, and the attempted murder of trucker Reginald Denny. The Watts riots (1965) claimed 34 lives. And then there was Kent State, where a riot went out of control and students were killed. I think most of us would have preferred that none of these ever happened, but there are those to actively encourage such violence, or promise to turn a blind eye to prosecuting the perpetrators.

              If violence comes, be prepared to defend yourself,your loved ones, your home and your property.  we know that there are groups just waiting for a chance to get an excuse to loot and destroy.  Having a sign ready that says "YOU LOOT, WE SHOOT" is not a bad idea. Then Do It !  Form cooperative groups to assist one another.  Be proactive and be prepared.

              Bronco bama has pretty much spent his wad. He never had any ammo to fight with so he manufactured some and now he is trying to use hate and violent threats. He doesn't realize that this country has the largest standing army of non-uniformed soldiers in the world. Only a complete imbecile would think they could scare the well trained militia that resides here. Oh, and all you anti-gun cowards, don't worry, we will keep you safe.

                He didn't 'build' that. He is simply the pawn of those who have been working, often behind the scenes for the last few decades trying to split us up, remove the 'melting pot' and pit especially people of color, but others as well against what used to be called 'ordinary Americans'. People of color were ordinary Americans when I was a kid, now they've been told for the last 20-30 years that they're oppressed victims and need to get back at whitey.

              I seem to remember back in 1968 when the Detroit riots took place that the blacks said that they were going to kill a white child in every suberb of Detroit. Needless to say every white person in the suberbs of Detroit armed themselves and the black's knew they'd get their asses shot off so that idea never developed. I say unto you Mr. Black man if you want to look me up and come to my house I'd be more than happy to great you and so will my M1911 A1 !

              Revenge?  Romney has not done anything to them to seek revenge for.  Obama on the other hand has not done anything for any of us.  H and his thugs can take a long walk off of a short pier.  We will not be intiminated!

              How did the Administration "benefit" from ACORN voter fraud? Somebody has their facts mixed up. How did we come to learn about the ACORN fraud? Look closely.

                  LOL! Who told you
                  <i>
                   that
                  </i>
                  ? Obama, along with several other attorneys, was paid as local counsel for ACORN in 1995 in a voting rights lawsuit joined by the Justice Dept. and the League of Women Voters, that's about where his connection to ACORN ends. The phony registrations were discovered and reported to election officials by ACORN itself, who had discovered that several individual canvassers had turned in "problematic" registrations. ACORN officials did as they were required: they flagged them to local election officials and turned them in. See--truth is often more interesting than fiction.

              If our inner cities are on fire, maybe we should just let them burn?  And then do not provide food stamps, medicaid, and welfare for those who did the burning!

              The only way the history books will get it right is if we first kick out all the liberl university scum teaching our children America is an evil empire. If obamnites want to loot and riot in the cities that's fine with me, i believe the rule of law should then be followed to the letter and give our police forces the right to shoot on sight anyone runing down the street with a tv or a couch etc etc. They need to learn there are consequences for these hidious actions and i think that is an appropriate consequence

              It's a bit ironic the group of people that spew coexistence and tolerance and don't believe in war are so hate filled and threatening violence against their fellow American. My guess is these passive aggressive pansies don't know how to fight. And if they had time to think on it, aren't the conservatives the ones with the guns? The left aren't so bright.

              I wonder if Obama understands that no matter how great a ride he's having right now, SOMEDAY he won't be President, and if what we all suspect (know to be true) comes out, that there really won't be a rock in this world he and Michelle can hide under? Millions of people will be looking for them...eventually finding them.
