    Summary
   </u>
   . During the 1980 Rendlesham Forest UFO event, Sgt. James
        Penniston experienced a telepathic download of binary data when he came
        in contact with what appeared to be a strange craft. He was able later
        to write down the information in a notebook. This recently revealed data
        can be decoded to show an initial short phrase of ASCII encoded words,
        with the rest being uninterpretable. However, when the data is processed
        with an image decoding algorithm found in the 2010 Wilton Windmill crop
        formation, recognizable images are obtained. One image appears to
        correspond to a description of beings offered by Larry Warren who was
        present during the event in 1980. Another appears to show two people
        engaged in some activities. The algorithm also decoded recognizable
        images from both the Wilton Windmill and 2002 Crabwood crop formations.
        The pattern of events suggests that the images given to us over the
        years were intended to be seen only after 2010 when the decoding
        algorithm was specified.
  </p>
  <p>
   A well-known encounter with UFOs occurred during two or three nights just
      after Christmas, 1980, in southern England. Mysterious lights seen in
      Rendlesham Forest were investigated by personnel from the American
      military base at Bentwaters. A good description of the reported events may
      be found in Richard Dolan's book,
   <em>
    <a href="http://keyholepublishing.com/Volume_2_Info.html">
     UFOs
          &amp; the National Security State, Vol II
    </a>
   </em>
   . Online sources
      that describe the case may be found

  </p>
  <p>
   During the first night of the event, Sgt. James Penniston was among a
      small group of people from the military base who encountered a strange
      glowing object on the ground. Penniston approached the object and touched
      it with his hand, and when he did so, the object increased in brightness.
      Almost 30 years later, he
   <a href="http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1802&amp;category=Environment">
    revealed
   </a>
   that he then experienced telepathic communication with the object. He
      learned that the object was from our future and was involved in a project
      to save future humanity from genetic degradation. He also received a
      download of information into his mind, and this information was encoded in
      a binary format. The information persisted in his mind until he wrote it
      down in his notebook after returning home.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The first image
  </h2>
  <p>
   In 2010, the first five pages of the notebook were released to the
      public via the
   <a href="http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1802&amp;category=Environment">
    Earthfiles
   </a>
   site. The information consists of a long sequence of 1's and 0's. The
      transcribed data may be seen in
   <a href="RendleshamBC/RBC.txt">
    this file
   </a>
   .
      When the sequence is treated as a continuous stream of 8-bit ASCII
      character codes, the following characters are obtained. Of course, any
      unprintable characters would not be shown.

  <p>
   Some embedded words are interpretable, but the text as a whole does not
      make much sense. Either there were errors in the transcriptions of the
      binary code, or it should be interpreted in a different way.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps the data can be interpreted as an image. An image decoding
      algorithm was discovered in the
   <a href="http://www.treurniet.ca/CropForms/WiltonPic.htm">
    Wilton
        Windmill
   </a>
   crop formation that appeared in May, 2010. As many as four
      recognizable images were successfully decoded from this formation. The
      algorithm was also applied to the 2002
   <a href="http://www.treurniet.ca/CropForms/CrabWilton.htm">
    Crabwood
   </a>
   formation which yielded a single recognizable image.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Wilton Windmill formation is best known for representing an almost
      correct form of the Euler formula, but it also contained a text string
      interpreted as the image decoding algorithm. The string was understood to
      mean "see the image decoded using 9x9 arrays of bytes with bits inverted".
      A sequence of bits from the formation that included the represention of
      the text strings was then decoded in different ways to produce four
      separate images. Two of these images were bipedal stick figures showing a
      friendly wave.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Crabwood crop formation contains a bit sequence that had already
      been decoded as a text string. The same data was decoded with the Wilton
      Windmill algorithm as a recognizable image of a bipedal figure extending a
      3-fingered hand. In each formation, the bits were arranged in such a way
      that both readable text and meaningful images were represented. Small
      errors and arbitrary case changes in the text could have been intentional
      in order to encode the images more accurately.
  </p>
  <p>
   The same decoding algorithm can be applied to the Penniston binary code
      as well. When treated as a sequence of ASCII characters, the code gave an
      initial short sequence of recognizable text, i.e.,
      "EXPLORATIONOGHUMANITY", which can be interpreted to mean "Exploration of
      humanity". The remainder of the decoded string contained parts of English
      words which are generally meaningless. Perhaps the initial text was meant
      to signal the proper beginning of image data if that were the primary
      purpose of the download.
  </p>
  <p>
   The left pane of Figure 1 shows the image decoded from Penniston's
      binary code using the algorithm given by the Wilton Windmill crop
      formation. The image was smoothed with a Gaussian filter to remove high
      frequency components introduced by the drawing method. The smoothed
      version is shown on the right.

   Like many crop formations, the interpretation of the pattern in Figure 1
      may be idiosyncratic. An obvious interpretation is the profile of
      something like a sitting cat or dog facing left with its tail curled up
      over its back on the right. For those having difficulty seeing this
      interpretation, elements of the body are labeled in Figure 2.

  <p>
   It is interesting to compare this image to the observations of Larry
      Warren, a member of the USAF Security Police present during the event some
      time after Penniston's experience. Warren (Warren and Robbins, 2005, p.
      47) saw the appearance of a bright bluish ball of light moving slowly just
      off the ground before stopping. Inside the ball were beings that looked
      initially like children. However, Warren could tell by their large heads
      and 'catlike' black eyes that these were not human beings. He could not
      make out any other facial features, but noticed their bright, almost
      silvery clothing. The beings appeared to be communicating silently with
      Wing Commander, Colonel Gordon Williams, who was also present.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warren's description is somewhat consistent with the being represented
      in the image. The image shows a large head, about half the height of the
      whole figure, with a prominent dark eye. The reference to a 'catlike' eye
      is reinforced by the presence of the catlike snout and long tail curled
      over the back of the being. These correspondences suggest that Penniston
      may have received an encoded image of the being seen later by Warren.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The second image
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the spring of 2014, a book by Nick Pope on the 1980 Rendlesham Forest
      Incident (Pope, 2014) was published, which described events surrounding
      the landing of the UFO in Rendlesham forest. It included the remainder of
      the sequence of binary codes said to have been downloaded into Penniston's
      mind when he touched the mysterious craft. This data was appended to the
      set that was published in 2010. The entire set decoded as text appears as
      follows.
  </p>
  <p>
   EXPLORATIONOGHUMANITY6lqzrINUOUSQSUTPQS"BURTHCOODINATECONTINUOTUQSHHH&amp;f&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;
   <br/>
   fFLLN'70hffldjlphjbbnb``lfdfnbb`brjdjfnddpbSORIG
      N520bhd
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the decoding algorithm, a second image should begin after 81
      bytes, or 648 bits from the beginning of the sequence. The text
      string from that point on is as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
   THCOODINATECONTINUOTUQSHHH&amp;f&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;fFLLN
   <br/>
   '70hffldjlphjbbnb``lfdfnbb`brjdjfnddpbSORIG
      N520bhd
  </p>
  <p>
   Again, the text makes little sense with the exception of the string at
      the start that might be interpreted as "The coordinate continues". Like
      the "EXPLORATION" text at the very beginning, this interpretable text
      might be a cue that image data starts at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
   This sequence of bits was decoded as a 9x9 image using the Wilton
      Windmill decoding algorithm. The resulting image is shown in the left
      panel of Figure 3, while the right panel shows the image smoothed with a
      Gaussian filter.

    Like the other low resolution images,
        it is a cartoon-like representation. It is readily interpreted as a
        person standing on the right looking left, and another person, seated in
        the upper left quadrant facing right. The seated person may be sitting
        on something with wheels, and the standing person may be pushing
        something with wheels.

   Comments on the Big Picture
  </h4>
  <p>
   There is a common thread that ties together the Rendlesham Forest UFO
      sightings, the Crabwood crop formation, and the Wilton Windmill crop
      formation. That is, one decoding algorithm extracted recognizable images
      from the three different bit streams obtained from the events. Further,
      all of the decoded images appear to represent living beings. For ease of
      comparison, the images are shown in Figure 3. The top row shows the year
      when the data sets were created, while the left to right presentation is
      the order in which they were decoded.

   Image 1 shows the cartoon form of a biped extending a three-fingered hand
      toward us, perhaps in greeting. Images 2 and 3 also show a bipedal figure
      with a hand apparently raised in greeting. Image 4 was interpreted as the
      head and shoulders of a rabbit-like figure. Image 5 was recognized as the
      front view of a helmeted or long-haired child riding a tricycle. Image 6
      is the profile of a seated animal with a long tail, and Image 7 contains
      the profiles of two people possibly engaged in some workplace activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The images appear to be representations of forms of life around us, some
      familiar and some not. Warren's account suggests that alien beings have
      been communicating directly with select people on earth, at least since
      1980. Perhaps tentative communication with a wider audience continued in
      2002 via the decoded Images 1-3 from the Crabwood and Wilton Windmill crop
      formations, respectively. All appear to offer greetings. The figure in
      Image 4 has the appearance of a rabbit from a child's book by Beatrice
      Potter. The rabbit, the child on a tricycle, the seated dog or cat, and
      the workplace scene may merely be symbols intended to promote a
      non-threatening atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some might wonder if all the images were staged as an entirely human
      project, given the controversy over who the makers of crop formations
      might be. There are several reasons why this is unlikely. In particular,
      the crop formations would have been difficult to design in that the same
      set of bits represent both a text message and one to four images. At the
      very least, this is a mathematical optimization problem requiring
      sophisticated resources to solve. Further, the construction of the complex
      Crabwood formation in a short time would have required extraordinary
      construction techniques and technology. Even if these problems could have
      been solved by human ingenuity, the Rendlesham episode could not have been
      staged by human conspirators. The displayed technology was too different
      from human capabilities, and non-human entities were observed. It follows,
      then, that the Crabwood and Wilton Windmill crop formations were not
      created solely by humans either, since all are connected by the common
      image decoding algorithm encoded in the latter formation.
