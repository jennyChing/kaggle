            My Prayer for Today
           </u>
           Dear Lord, I thank you for this day. I thank You for my being able to
see and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving
God and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You
keep on blessing me. Forgive me this day for everything I have done,
said or thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your
forgiveness.

Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to start this
day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best
of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from You.

Please broaden my mind that I can accept all things.
 
Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over. Let
me continue to see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my
wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.

And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example
to --- slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best
response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't
pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to do Your will. 
Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to others. Keep me
strong that I may help the weak. Keep me uplifted that I may have
words of encouragement for others. I pray for those who are lost and
can't find their way. I pray for those who are misjudged and 
misunderstood. I pray for those who don't know You intimately. 
I pray for those who don't believe. But I thank you that I believe.
 
I believe that God changes people and God changes things. I pray for
all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member in
their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes that
they are out of debt and all their needs are met.
 
I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem,
circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in Your
hands for You to fight. I pray that these words be received into the
hearts of every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses
them willingly.
 This is my prayer.
In Jesus' Name, Amen.
