             In spite of the drumming propaganda, every record of super-longevitybelongs to smokers. Here is the case of Zhang Shuqing, a centenarian inPixian, Sichuan, China, turned 100 on May 7, and who buried his owndaughter  probably a non smoker!  eight years ago. Jokes aside, one is tothink and really ponder on this. Record-setters of longevity are ALL smokerswith a lot of other bad habits: Zhang also eats like a pig, including adaily bowl of pork fat! A paradox" Hold on: what is a paradox" Somethingcontrary to scientifically established facts, or contrary to BELIEFS passedas scientific facts" Lets face it: if smoking were such a bad habit Zhangand so many like him would not be here to prove the opposite, would they"

The Italian daily Libero has just reportedupdates on the Tobacco Massacre of Milan last February 6th. Outof a population of 2.2 million in that city, there are 646 people whoselives will, inevitably, be cut short  shortly after they turn 100. Two ofthem are already 110, five are 109 and 12 are 106. Another 217 are only 100,167 just turned 101, and 115 are 102. But thats not over. Over 35,000Milanese are in the age range between 85 and 94, and another 92,000 arebetween 75 and 84. You can see them in the polluted Italian city with theirdogs, in the typical little bars, indulging in despicable habits such ascoffee, grease-filled
            <i>

Imagine how dirty their lungs are.According to the daily, in fact, the overwhelming majority of these peopleeither smokes, drinks, or eats fatty foods. Most even

              Smoking Kills Famous Director
             </b>
            </a>
            - Succumbing to a life time of smoking, Hollywood director Billy Wilder died Wednesday at the age of 95.The 6-time Oscar winner directed such classics as "Some Like It Hot" and "Sunset Boulevard". His 1955 movie "The Seven Year Itch" made a contemporary icon of Marilyn Monroe's pose over a New York subway vent. The premature deaths of these two well-known victims of tobacco give added urgency to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's campaign to eliminate smoking from movies. Once smoking is banished from the silver screen, the focus can be shifted to the people who make and star in the movies the movies. The carnage must be halted.

He was 104. Fuentes died of cancer Sunday at his home in Cojimar, the quiet Cuban fishing village about 10 miles east of Havana where Hemingway used to dock the Pilar.

He was 82. Another premature, tobacco-related death, no doubt. We are not kidding. Every smoker who dies is logged as a tobacco-related death to beef up mortality statistics and imply that those who don't smoke are either immortal, or live much longer lives. And when they die (sorry, IF they die) they are not logged as a tobacco-related deaths even if they died of the identical diseases of smokers.  How else do you think that the anti-tobacco cartel builds up its statistical garbage about the "smoking epidemic""
