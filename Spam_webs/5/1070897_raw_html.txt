            .
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: My wife and I have been supporters and dedicated listeners of you for over 20 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Thank you very much, sir. Really do appreciate that.
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: Well, I have a comment, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Yeah.
           </p>

            CALLER: In the run-up to 2012 election you beat up on some of the candidates so badly, especially Romney, that I think that you and some of the others affected the election. And I think you're starting to do the same thing again here for the 2016 election as well. And I think, you know, try to be a little more positive toward our candidates. You can get critical, but not too prejudicial. We need to win the election in 2016 no matter who our candidate is, Rush. Those are my comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Wait a minute, let me just take these in order. Because your memory on this may differ from mine, but what did I do to harm Romney, particularly in the general, in --
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: Not the general. The primary.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Yeah, but after that, everything's forgotten and then I ended up supporting Romney wholeheartedly against Obama, once it was decided. I know you know that four million Republicans didn't vote in 2012 that did in 2008, and I'm flattered you think they might have been influenced to stay home because of criticism of Romney they might have heard here. I don't think people need me to tell them things about Republicans to be unhappy. I think there's genuine dissatisfaction throughout the Republican base with a lot of what's going on in the Republican Party. They don't need me to tell them.
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: Well, but they responded before the election this last year, bringing in a majority of senators and a strong House. So there's something working now.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Well, see, here's the thing. You're talking about the election in November?
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: Yes.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Okay, the Republican voters that turned out and voted in that election are already being told that their votes and their desires are gonna be ignored. They're already being told in one way or another by people in Washington, the Republican Party or the consultant class, that they're not really gonna get -- we're gonna move and do what we want to do and they're not gonna stop Obama. They're not about stopping Obama and that's what this election was all about.
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: Well, but Boehner already is gonna put up a bill that is stronger than anybody expected out of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            <img class="img_right" id="eZObject_100710" src="http://www.rushimg.com/cimages//media/images/reaganshort4/1338820-1-eng-GB/ReaganShort.jpg"/>
            RUSH: Well, I have to admit, I have to admit that there is some truth to that. I'm a little bit surprised by it at the same time, but we'll see. It's one thing to propose it. We'll see how much it's supported as it starts heading through the legislative process.
           </p>
           <p>
            CALLER: I guess all I'm asking of you is be careful what you say about our candidates 'cause one of them will be running against a Democrat, and we want the Republicans to win.
           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Well, about that, let me just -- there are a lot of Republicans -- well, I shouldn't say a lot. I don't know what the number is. But there are a significant, there is a significant percentage of Republican voters who don't want those candidates to win. They're tired of it, because those candidates don't win. Those candidates don't win, and those candidates usually make no bones about the fact that they don't support the base of the party.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not doing any of this. The people that listen to this program are independent thinkers. They're not pied pipers waiting for me to tell 'em what to think, just like you. You've been listening 20 years, and if anything I may validate what you already believe, but I doubt you withhold your vote or your opinion until hearing what mine is. You act independently. But four million Republicans didn't vote. And it wasn't me telling 'em to stay home. I was as shocked as anybody when I found out they stayed home. 'Cause I, like you, I thought the imperative was to beat Obama at all costs. It was the only opportunity we really were gonna have to stop and repeal some of this stuff, and I thought that mattered more than anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there are some Republican voters who are really angry, who feel entirely betrayed. Their money has been asked for and their money has been given, and their money's been taken, and they have not been satisfied. As I said, I don't know what the percentage is, and let's not forget, these candidates themselves are out saying unflattering things about these voters. You never hear the Democrats running down their own base. You would never hear a Democrat potential nominee saying, "Yeah, my objective here is to win this without the Warren vote. My objective is to win this without the Clinton vote. My objective is to win this without the Bill Maher vote."
           </p>
           <p>
            You never hear them saying they don't want to win their base. But our candidates are out saying that. It doesn't take me reminding them. I mean, they hear it. Besides, we call it as we see it here, and if you think that I want to see Hillary Clinton elected -- and, by the way, you know, this has come up again. I forget which cable news network. Now, it's been over 25 years I've been doing this program, and I saw yet again last week somebody said -- it was Chris Matthews. It was Chris Matthews who said once again that I am happiest when the Republicans lose because if the Republicans win, I don't have a show. I got nothing to complain about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of these people have actually contorted themselves into the oddest positions of believing that I actually want the Democrats to win so that I will have something to talk about. They cannot get it through their heads that my first, second, third, fourth, only concern is the country. My program's gonna succeed no matter who wins elections. It isn't about that. But that's how they think.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            RUSH: Hey, just one more thing about that, too, folks. How many times have we heard Republican establishment people say, "The era of Reagan is over"? How many people have we heard say, "We gotta move on. We can't think about Reagan anymore. That's a trap. The days of Reagan are the old days. We gotta move on." You ever hear the Democrats say, "We gotta move on from FDR. We gotta move on from LBJ. We gotta move on from the Great Society. We gotta move on from the War on Poverty"? You never her 'em say that. They never denigrate their own like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, I'm telling you, when you say "the era of Reagan is over" and we gotta move on from Reagan, you don't need me around to get people mad about that. They're fully capable of it on their own. And then when you add to that how many Republicans in the Senate run around impugning Ted Cruz -- do you know how many people in the Republican base would love to see him elected president? And they know it, and that's why they're running around running Ted Cruz down. When's the last time you heard Democrats run down Elizabeth Warren? My only point is, it doesn't take me or anybody else on the radio or TV to get people mad at the Republican establishment. They are handling that all on their own.
           </p>

            Now, one thing, we have a story here from our buddies at NewsBusters in 2013. This is Brent Bozell's website that monitors what happens out there in the Drive-By Media and reports on it for people interested. I didn't see this, 'cause I don't watch the Sunday shows... James Carville was on This Week, and he said Ted Cruz is the most talented and fearless Republican politician he has seen in 30 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carville said, "I think Ted Cruz is the most talented and fearless Republican politician I've seen in the last 30 years. I further think that he's gonna run for president, and he's gonna create something. I'm not sitting here saying he's going to win, and I think Senator DeMint is right. I've listened to excerpts of his speech in South Carolina. Ted Cruz touches every button, and this guy has no fear. He just keeps plowing ahead and he's gonna be something to watch."
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, the bit about Cruz being fearless, do not doubt that, and do not diminish the importance of that, particularly as Carville notes it here. They will always tell us one way or the other who they are worried about. Carville wasn't finished. He said, "And a lot of Republicans feel this way, George, and you hear this a lot: 'If we only got someone who was articulate and was for what we were for, we would win elections. And we get these John McCains and these Mitt Romneys and these squishy guys that cant do anything.' Well, theres one thing this guy is not -- he aint squishy, not in the least."
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, Carville is in a polling unit with Stan Greenberg, and part of what Carville does is to try to keep his finger on the pulse, primarily to help Democrats deal with it. Now, I happen to know that everything he says here is accurate about Ted Cruz. I don't know whether he's got it in his own polling data, but what I'm assuring you of here, he's not making it up. There are a lot of Republicans who are craving leadership right now. You know how many Republican conservatives there are in this country who would just kill for a candidate who could articulate conservatism the same way they do it?
           </p>
           <p>
            I said last week, and I'm gonna repeat it here again, if such a candidate came along, a leadership, elected politician, elected office type politician, not a commentator, not a pundit, not a radio or TV person. I'm talking about somebody in elective politics who can come along and can articulate conservatism as the average American understands it, this guy could win in a landslide.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people have been waiting for years for somebody to come along and simply say what they already know to be true, somebody to simply articulate what they already think and what they already feel. And they resent being told that what they think and what they feel is extremist and dangerous and is tiny, minority, and so forth. Because they aren't. They are the backbone of America. They are the ones that make America work. They're the ones that are totally invested in saving this country as founded. And they have nobody in elected politics who talks like they believe. They have nobody saying things they believe in. And the candidates that come the closest to it always get their universal support.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what Carville's afraid of, and make no mistake about this that Carville is concerned. He said that Ted Cruz is the most fearless Republican since Reagan. You can look it up. You can see it on YouTube. He was on "This Week Needs Brinkley, and he knows. They all know, folks. They all know. All these liberal Democrats know they are a minority. They all know. That's why they work so consistently to destroy their opposition in image and perception. They have to get people voting against their opposition because they're never gonna win if all that's happening is people voting for them. There aren't enough of those.
           </p>
           <p>
            <img class="img_left" id="eZObject_100713" src="http://www.rushimg.com/cimages//media/images/james-carville-505/1338829-1-eng-GB/James-Carville-505_large.png"/>
            Liberalism is still a minority viewpoint in this country. You just don't know it because the media and pop culture is all liberal. But the Drive-By Media, the pop culture, music, TV, books, they're not writing and talking and doing TV shows about average, ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things every day. They don't make the news. They don't star in TV shows. They don't record songs. They don't write books. But everybody knows they're there, and that's why they are the constant targets of ridicule and impugn and destruction. And Ted Cruz has been the target of more of this than anybody in elective politics in a long time, and he has not wavered from it at all and that is respected.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if it's not Cruz, if it could be somebody else, somebody that comes along and can simply articulate with passion and all the usual good cheer -- and by that everybody means optimism -- of the things people already in this country believe. Obama doesn't do it. People in this country don't believe what Obama's selling. They might have in 2008. They don't anymore. The only thing the Democrats can do is destroy the people they fear. All they can do is impugn the philosophies that they fear. They can't survive a debate in the arena of ideas, and they can't survive an election where, if everybody had to be voting only for something -- this election that just happened was a total anti-Democrat Party, anti-Barack Obama vote.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's not a Republican leader out there people were voting for. Not yet. There wasn't a Republican agenda people were voting for, because the Republicans didn't have one. Now, as I say, individual Republican candidates did, running for the Senate, running against Obamacare, but once again it was against Obama. This election was clearly totally anti, of the people who showed up totally anti. Now, I know it was not a presidential turnout and, as such, the Democrat presidential turnout base didn't show up in as great a number as they always do. Doesn't matter to me. This can happen during a presidential year. I know all these people are gonna line up and tell you it can't, "Well, Rush, you look at the Electoral College, we lost New York, we lost California, we lose Texas, it's over, Rush, it doesn't matter."
           </p>
           <p>
            That's what they want you to believe, that it doesn't matter. They don't want you even worrying about voting. They want you thinking it's hopeless. They want you thinking you don't have a prayer, the Republicans don't have a prayer, the deck is too stacked against you, the media, you'll never overcome the media, Hollywood, you'll never overcome Hollywood. They want you pessimistic about this. That's why anybody that comes along who shows any promise at articulating conservatism in any way that's infectious, they set out and try to destroy and impugn, media people included in this one, not just people in elective politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have to. That's the first order of business for them. Now they've got Republicans believing that the only way they can win is to do what? Do what Obama's doing, grant amnesty to Hispanics? Really? That's not what people in this country are clamoring for. The Republicans are gonna win by siphoning off some Hispanic votes from Obama here and some African-American votes from the Democrats over there and some women votes and whoever over there. Suicide mission. Absolute suicide mission, yet that is what it appears to be the believed-in stratagem of the Republican leadership.

            RUSH: I also had somebody send me a note saying, "Hey, Rush, those four million Republicans that sat home in 2012, I don't know how many of 'em it is, but I talked to a bunch of people who thought the election was in the bag, and that's why they didn't vote. They thought Romney was gonna win in a landslide, and they didn't bother showing up to vote."
           </p>
           <p>
            I've not heard any analysis of the electorate that stayed home in terms of that, a percentage reflecting that point of view. I suppose it could be true some. But I don't know too many people who wanted to take the chance. To some people, though, you know, to some people, voting is hard. You have to get up and go there, you stand in line. If you haven't registered you have to do that. You have to deal with people like at the DMV. To some people it's just too big a hassle. Don't doubt me on this.
