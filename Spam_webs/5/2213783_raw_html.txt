     The Minnesota School shooting.

      Where does this story start, and where does it end?
     </i>
     <p>
      <font color="#ff9900" face="arial,helvetica,verdana" size="2">
       A man in Minneapolis, Minnesota, decided to take his own life one day.  The 
police arrived on the scene, including his father who was also a police 
officer, and they spent all day trying to convince him not to kill himself.  
They were unsuccessful and so on that day in July of 1997, he committed 
suicide.
       <p>
        The man was survived by his wife and his son. His wife is an alcoholic, and 
abuses her son until two years later when she ends up getting into a car 
accident after drinking with a friend.  She survives, but a head injury has 
left her trying to learn to tie her shoes again, and she is moved into a 
nursing home. Jeff, her son, moved in with his paternal grandmother on an Ojibwa 
(Chippewa) Indian Reservation in Red Lake, Minnesota.  Jeff resents the 
move, wishing he could be in the city with the friends he had there.  His 
grandfather, the policeman, is living with a younger woman approximately the 
age of Jeff's mom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff goes to school with 300 other students on the Indian reservation in 
what's definately considered to be the bad part of town. He's a bright kid, 
with a strong imagination, but the events he has been through has cut him 
deeply.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, without his parents around, he's trying to identify himself, and 
does that by looking closely at American Indians he shares the reservation 
with.  He's disappointed to note that despite the rich cultural background 
he shares with them, they seem more interested in black culture, and rap 
music. Many of his tribesmen can't even speak their native tongue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff looks at that as being an evil influence in the people around him. He 
begins to feel as though it interferes with his own attempt to identify 
with his Indian heritage.  He just wishes that he could become untainted, 
AND fit in somewhere. He's never even liked Rap music.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it's around that time that he joined a band called '6six6' but I 
can't determine anything further about the band, not even what genre it was, 
although it's been said that he liked heavy metal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Somewhere at this point, he decides to join an online Nazi organization.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a very unlikely move by a Native American, and when he introduced 
himself to the group, they were certainly surprised to see him there. He 
expressed his views to them, and asked if there was more he could do besides 
recruiting others.  He was passionate about it, and it is perhaps very 
telling about the situation that he  stopped posting on the board 
publically, and they stopped publically communicating with him.  That's pure 
speculation though.
       </p>
       <p>
        He simply doesn't fit in at school. He starts thinking along the lines of 
racial cleansing, and begins to follow Hitler's teachings.  He dresses like 
one of the shooters from the Columbine shootings.  He even made jokes with 
students saying things like: "That would be cool if I shot up the school".  A 
short time later, while learning to make Flash animations, he made one 
called "Target Practice".  It consisted of a gunman that shoots people and 
grenades a police car before shooting himself in the head. (

        ,  be sure to look at his profile and 
his comments as well as the reviews for the clip, although some of it 
contains coarse language).
       </p>
       <p>
        He did like zombie films though...more specifically, one of his favorite 
movies was "Dawn of the Dead".  He went online to a Zombie bulletin board 
forum and joined an ongoing zombie story creation series. He left with a 
post in February of last year claiming that things were getting crazy at 
home and that he might have to leave suddenly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Something interesting about his Nazi posts though.  He mentioned that there 
had been a school threat that he was blamed for, someone was supposed to 
"shoot up the school" on 4/20/04, Hitler's birthday.  He was under scrutiny 
for it because the school was aware of his National Socialist interest. He 
may have been lying about this claim though, to make himself appear more 
persecuted or something to his Nazi website friends.  His principal refused 
to comment on this issue when asked by the news media.
       </p>
       <p>
        It may have been that they were concerned because he'd written a zombie 
story online that revolved around a high school invasion.  The story 
included two characters that were dressed in all black, contained complaints 
about how security had tightened up after the Columbine incident, etc. ( 
writers coven website, Dec. 2003:
        <a href="http://p081.ezboard.com/fwriterscovenfrm8.showMessage?topicID=49.topic">
         http://p081.ezboard.com/fwriterscovenfrm8.showMessage?topicID=49.topic
        </a>
        )  By 
itself, the story doesn't mean anything, but when you take elements of 
Jeff's life and put them together, they immediately show a sense of context 
with the rest of his life.  As far as the story goes, it's interesting to 
note that his main character wasn't some kind of callous hardcore killer 
that sometimes show up in these types of stories.  I think the character 
really represented Jeff, from the clothes he wore, to a certain amount of 
body weight sensitivity, to his hair style.  It's also interesting to note 
that both of the main characters make reference to their mothers, and hint 
at their relationship with them, but there isn't even a hint that they had 
fathers.  Although there is a bit of gore in the story, it's really not 
overly so.  This story, like the many other (good) zombie stories out there 
focuses on a story of life, and survival, though tinged with a certain 
hopelessness, it doesn't focus on horrific death scenes.
       </p>
       <p>
        His schoolmates say that he seemed like a pretty good guy, and friendly, 
though he was apparently still picked on, and didn't have many friends.  
They also said he was quiet, but one went so far as to say that he was 
terrorized by those that thought he was weird. He drew pictures of skeletons 
and talked about death all of the time.  He dressed in combat boots with red 
laces, a big black trenchcoat, and wore black eyeliner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some time passes, and for some undisclosed reason, Jeff is taken out of 
school by the local school board, and put into a home school program.  
Apparently this was done for his benefit, considering that he was by this 
point 6 foot tall, 250 pounds, and had been held-back a couple of years, he 
was getting teased a bit about it.   He attempted suicide with a razor, 
unsuccessfully, and was put on anti-depression medicine (Prozac).  He also 
voluntarily entered into a mental health ward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Weise posts his last change to his MSN member directory, under the name: 
Sltd.
        <a href="http://members.msn.com/default.msnw?guids=5aXX8tO9KEjnWANMWs749Y3cD1rJr6hljzJEOsRSwhw35eWkLkp0NoeYk3WWt6I7Do">
         It reads like a final thoughts posting
        </a>
        , though unlike some of the others in 
that there were no curse words or anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then on March 21, 2005 at 16 years of age, he takes his grandfather's 
police-issue handguns, a shotgun, his grandfather's bulletproof vest and 
gunbelt.  He shoots and kills his grandfather and his grandfather's 
girlfriend in their home.  Then about 3:00PM he takes his grandfather's police 
car, and drives to his old school.
       </p>
       <p>
        He get's out in front of the school, and fires two shotgun blasts into the 
air. Weise then approached the entry doors to the school, and the school's 
metal detectors.  Two unarmed security guards are at their post. They see 
Weise approaching the four metalclad doors.  Weise tried one door and found 
it locked, he tried the next two and as one guard (a female) got up from her 
desk and urged the other to run, Weise found the unlocked door and went in. 
Weise fired another shot into the air.  The guard recognized Weise, and 
noticed two handguns at his waist only partially concealed by the billowing 
black trenchcoat. The guards are unarmed and not wearing bulletproof vests.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the guard turns to run, she notices students running towards the front of 
the school to see where the shots are coming from.  She goes to head them 
off and sees her partner still sitting at the desk, despite her yelling at 
him to run and protect the children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The female guard started yelling at the kids, "Run! there's a guy with a gun 
here! Just run!" As she ran off to protect them, she radioed in, "There's a 
guy coming in the school and he's shooting and he has a gun." As they 
hurried to get out of the back of the school, the guard turned back and saw 
her partner getting up, going right towards Weise. She and the students 
hurried down the hallway and heard two more shots.
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumably the guard had tried to talk Jeff into giving up, but no one will 
ever know for sure, though witnesses say that those two shots were the ones 
that took his life.
       </p>
       <p>
        All hell broke loose as other shots were fired and Weise was catching up to 
the guard before turning off down a side hallway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Weise chased a teacher and some students down a hallway, shooting and 
injuring the 62-year-old teacher who then reached the relative safety of a 
classroom with her students.  Weise managed to get there anyway, 
shot/killed the teacher and killed other students in that classroom before 
roaming the halls, firing seemingly at random.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teachers locked down their classrooms. Witness accounts say that Jeff was 
smiling and waving as he shot people.  Perhaps it was sarcasm, but we'll 
probably never know.
       </p>
       <p>
        He reportedly asked a student if the student believed in God before shooting 
him in the head.  Children claimed they could hear people shouting at him by 
name, "No Jeff! No!"
       </p>
       <p>
        Weise went for two girls, but a 15-year-old boy named Jeff May intervened 
and stabbed Weise in the side with a pencil. Weise shot him in the right 
cheek and the bullet lodged in his neck.  Jeff May survived the attack but 
suffered a stroke and is unable to move his left side. It isn't known if he 
will recover, though he is currently able to write notes to his family, and 
can breathe on his own, which doctors say is a good sign.
       </p>
       <p>
        One boy later claimed that Jeff had made eye contact with him.  He thought 
he was sort of friends with Jeff, and was shocked when Jeff brought up the 
gun to shoot him.  Someone else running past got in the way, and the boy 
escaped.
       </p>
       <p>
        He shot and killed 5 students, 1 teacher and 1 security guard. He injured 7 
students. Two of the wounded had been shot in the chest, one had a hip 
injury, and three (including Jeff May) were shot in head.  One of the 
students with head injuries died in the hospital, another had undisclosed 
injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Weise opened fire at four policemen that had entered the school to take him 
down, and one of the officers returned fire, though it's believed he missed 
his mark. Weise ran back into the classroom he'd been in earlier, and shot 
himself in the head. As he'd indicated in one of his posts on the Nazi 
website, he didn't like the prospect of jail.
       </p>
       <p>
        When all was said and done, from the time he shot the guard to the time he 
shot himself, 10 minutes had elapsed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now families are mourning, and the families of the victims from Columbine 
feel as though their wounds have all been reopened.  Several of the people 
from Columbine, including the mayor, intend to go up to Red Rock to help 
families up there begin the healing process.
       </p>
       <p>
        A lot of people are clamoring that there were warning signs that shouldn't 
have been missed, but the reality is that a lot of what I've gleaned has 
been through internet research on his various postings around the internet. 
To those around him, he perhaps seemed a little strange, and a bit morbid, 
but it's not until you encounter his internet life that you get a feel for a 
boy calling for help.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my count, I've found 5 different email addresses that he used, including 
two MSN accounts and 3 Hotmail accounts, I've found him to be using several 
different aliases too, each one led me to the next.  It's relatively easy 
tracking something like that. His posts in general were honest, and fit the 
other information coming out, suggesting that he really did want someone to 
catch up with him. He had a couple of "about me" type homepages, and a 
weblog, in addition to several member pages that he filled out fairly 
thoroughly at some of the forums he visited.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FBI is saying that it's hard to create a profile for a person who causes 
events like these because any descriptions of any signs they submit would 
represent a sizable chunk of the population.  Not only that, but it might 
make people blind to other warning signs that someone might exhibit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of my sources were Jeff Weise's various internet postings, aside from 
all of the details of the shooting itself, those were gleaned from several 
news sources, including MSNBC, CNN, The Smoking Gun, and the New York Times. 
  The New York Times has the most complete article to date, though it seemed 
to contain some discrepancies with other known  facts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The timeline for this information (except for the shootings themselves) are 
blotchy at best.  It's not known for sure what the absolute order of things 
were.  There is also information that the FBI is currently withholding until 
their investigation is complete.

       <p>
        While looking at the things he posted, I was drawn to the fact that it 
didn't appear that he had any idea he'd be a killer one day.  Yes, there was 
quite a bit of racial prosecution resentment, but the following quote is 
about as bad as he got in dealings with others (his member pages are 
different).  This is from a review on an anti-gun Flash video he viewed, in 
his own words:
--
"A country founded on the deaths of millions of Native Americans, a country 
built on the deaths of innocents. A country forged from a holocaust greater 
than that of the Jews. Adolf Hitler supposedly killed 6 million innocent 
Jews in its death camps and ghettos, Christopher Columbus is responsible 
for the deaths of over 8 million Native Americans. Which one has his own 
holiday? On the subject of guns, one day I'll gladly buy my sons (once I 
have them) assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, rifles, whatever. It's my 
right as an "American." God bless America, for killing billions of people 
world wide. Love it or leave it, you've got no choice. :)"
--
       </p>
       <p>
        It appears that (according to his weblog) that somewhere in December of 
2004, he was dealt a large blow that he was having difficulty coping with.  
At the beginning of the weblog, there's a sense of a fresh start and new 
beginnings, but by the second post, he's angry about life in general, and 
belittling himself for trying to make a new start for himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        On some of the forums he was quite friendly and polite to the other folks 
there.  So at what point did that change to TRUE murderous intent?
       </p>
       <p>
        Was he plotting and planning since the middle of last year? Or was he merely 
on a path that took him to that point perhaps a month prior to carrying it 
out?  In September, according to the post I quoted above, he still intended 
to have children of his own one day.  Notice he didn't say "if" he had 
kids..
       </p>
       <p>
        Did he know he was becoming a monster?  Was that the plan?
       </p>
       <p>
        Will we ever know?

        In any event, I found it quite interesting to hop around to his various 
posts around the internet and submit these links for you to look at, if you 
wish, to get a peek into the mind of a very troubled young man who turned 
into a murderer.  Some of these links will go bad quickly, I initially had 
more, but upon rechecking them, I've found that a lot of his posts have been 
removed.

        There is a webblog where a lot of the information and links are being copied 
and added to the site, if you're interested, it's certainly a good resource 
for these events.  He apparently started a little late to catch some of the 
earlier stuff, but I think folks are feeding him the missing stuff from 
their own downloads:

        I'd be remiss if I didn't also add this site too, where more info can be 
found (I'm Deadguy on there):

        Finally, the Zombie forums he used to frequent have removed his membership 
data and removed the posts he made, but have added a thread of conversation 
which includes several thought-provoking mature views on what their concerns 
are as having "rubbed elbows" with someone that snapped like this:
