         Dear Home Studio Owner:
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Youre reading this because you have a sneaky suspicion.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You know that your mixes could be better. You also suspect that the answer to better mixes isnt simply to buy better plugins! Sure, it sounds nice. Sure it helps plugin manufacturers sell their products. But it doesnt address your core problem.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Heres what it looks like to buy a shiny new plugin:
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You hear so many pro engineers talk about how they use this plugin on all their mixes. So you think to yourself, If they use it, and they make good mixes, then if I use it, I will make good mixes! Thats like me saying I could hit the ball like Tiger Woods if only I had the same clubs he uses. Theres a disconnect. A problem with the logic.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <strong>
          It aint true.
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The next thought that pops into your head is something like this: Are you saying that a $900 EQ plugin isnt any better than my stock EQ that came free with my recording software? Nope. Not saying that at all. Just like I wouldnt argue that a Toyota Corolla is better than a Bentley Continental. But if theyre both a stick-shift, and I dont know how to drive stick, neither one of them is any good to me.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In the same way, if you dont know how to effectively use EQ to get the most out of your tracks, it wont matter if youre using stock EQs or EQs yanked directly out of Abbey Road Studios, the result will be the same. Youll be grinding the gears, messing things up, and probably screaming at the tools.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Oh, and your mixes wont sound any better.
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You may not like what Im telling you, but deep down you know Im right. I know because Ive been there.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Ive had those late nights. Way too many cups of coffee. Eyes burning. Teeth grinding. Almost to the point of tears from the sheer frustration of wrestling with a mix that refuses to come together. The more you tweak, the worse it sounds.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Then you make a horrible decision. You open up iTunes and listen to your favorite album, and it sounds amazing. Full and rich. You switch back to your mix, and it sounds something has gone horribly wrong with your speakers. You check the cables and settings. Nope, thats just the way my mix sounds.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You start to wonder if youre getting brain damage from all the times you bang your head on your desk.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         This was supposed to be fun.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         This was supposed to be a creative outlet.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         It feels more like a prison
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Now for some good newsfollowed by some bad news.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The good news is this: You absolutely CAN create amazing, jaw-dropping, friend-impressing mixes in a home recording studio.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The bad news? It takes a lot of time to get there.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Very few people set up their home studio on Sunday and have a chart-topping hit mix by the following weekend.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Just like learning to play guitar, it takes time and practice.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         But theres another variable you can add to the equation that can (in many cases) speed up the results considerably. What is it? Having a mentor.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         No, Im not talking about weekly cups of coffee and long walks.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Im simply referring to following someone whos gone before you. Someone who has figured a lot of this stuff out. Someone who can shorten your journey from frustrated and embarrassed to holy smokes, did that mix come out of my studio?!.
         <br/>
         What Goes Into a Good Mix?
         <br/>
         Obviously there is no magic pill I could give you that would cure all your recording and mixing woes. Theres no single technique or trick that will save the day.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Knowing how to use EQ well wont solve every problem youll ever face in your studio.
         <br/>

          "Your Understanding EQwas the first series I bought. And the quality of my work jumped up instantly (after YEARS of plateauing, and listening back to hear all my earlier work sound like I recorded it in a cave). So I recognize (and have experienced) the potential growth that taking action can bring!!

          I just wanted to say thanks for your training help in the past and for the push to join HMM now. I'm excited to keep moving and progressing."

          For your single payment of $147 today, you'll get Understanding EQ plus access to the $291 worth of bonuses listed above.
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Think about it for a minute. Youve spent well over $147 on just ONE piece of equipment in your studio. Why not invest a little time and money into something that will have a much bigger impact than any new piece of gear or plugin will?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Youre already invested in your studio. Why not invest in yourself, so you can get the most out of your studio?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You could easily spend 30 times the money on a fancy plugin bundle. But I would suggest that youll see a more dramatic improvement from investing in yourself over only investing in gear.

         Frequently Asked Questions
        </h2>
        <p class="role-element leadstyle-text">
         <strong>
          Q: Do I need to own Pro Tools?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         A: Nope! I actually don't use Pro Tools anymore. These videos were done using Presonus Studio One, but the great part about all my training programs is that they aren't software-dependent. I focus 100% of my attention on teaching
         <strong>
          concepts
         </strong>
         . These concepts can be directly applied to whatever software you use. (I've even had people buy Understanding EQ to train live sound folks!)
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Q: Will I have instant access to the material?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         A: Yes! As soon as you place your order, our system will send you an email with your login information. You can immediately log into the HSC Customer Center and start watching Video #1!
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Q: Are the videos streaming only?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         A: No! If you prefer to download the videos and watch them offline, we've made that option available to you.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Q: What if you come out with a new version of Understanding EQ in the future? Will I have to buy it again to get access to the new material?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         A: No! The way we run Home Studio Corner is like this: once you buy something, you're in. For life. If I release a new version of Understanding EQ in the future that sells for double what you paid, you'll get access to all that new stuff FOR FREE. Forever.
