The information generally falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you download and activate the Mobu application, register a Mobu account, or sign up for a product or service offered by Mobu and (2) tracking information gathered as you use the Mobu application..
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What this Privacy Policy Covers: This Privacy Policy covers Mobus treatment of personally identifiable information that Mobu collects when you are on the website, when you purchase Mobus services and when you use Mobus services. This policy does not describe information collection policies on other sites, including those linked to or from Mobu. This Privacy Policy does not include or cover the privacy and the confidentiality of communications content when using the services and products of Mobu and Mobu does not guarantee or warrant or agree that your communications will remain confidential or private.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Information from Other Sources: We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.
       <br/>
       <br/>

The use of such anonymous identifiers (such as cookies, Web beacons or tagging) is subject to the advertising companys privacy policy, not this Mobu Privacy Policy.

      Our calling rates and charges are provided within the App and are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

You understand that you will pay any additional charges you incur if you connect to the services through a phone number provided by Mobu while you are in a country that is not the same country associated with your network or mobile phone provider (Roaming Charges). Roaming Charges will be charged in addition to any charges you may incur when using the App from another country. You are responsible for checking all applicable rates and charges prior to placing a call with the App. We may change the billing period or the rates and charges at any time by posting changes on the website. Any change that is required by law or governmental authority will be effective immediately.
      <br/>
      Charges for calls are measured in whole minutes and fractions of a minute will be rounded up to the next whole minute. Timing of the call begins when the call is answered by your contact, including voicemail or an automatic reply. Timing of the call ends when the user hangs up or when Mobu receives a signal that the call has terminated from the terminating carrier.
      <br/>
      All calls are pre-paid. You may add to your account balance at any time on the Website or through the App. When a call is charged against your account, we will charge against available balance purchased by you.

You understand and agree that if for any reason your account balance becomes negative, you hereby authorize us to charge the negative account balance to any credit or debit card on file with your account without any additional confirmation. We reserve the right to retain any payment information and to charge any card or other payment information for any outstanding amounts on your account so long as your account remains active and for a reasonable period after an account is terminated. If the charge to your account is not accepted for any reason (other than your good faith dispute of a charge), we may charge an additional fee of $10 per transaction and a late fee of $10 per month. We will apply such fees to your unpaid balance.
      <br/>
      All rates and charges are reflected in U.S. dollar amounts and all payments must be made in U.S. dollars.
