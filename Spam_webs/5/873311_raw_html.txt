      CENTENNIA
     </b>
     is a map-based guide to the history of Europe and the

Middle East from the beginning of the 11th century to the present. It is
 a
     <i>
      dynamic, animated
     </i>
     historical atlas including over 9,000 border
 
changes. The map controls evolve the map forward or backward in time bringing the static map to life. Our maps display every major war and territorial conflict displaying the status of each region at intervals of a tenth of a year. The maps reflect actual "power on the ground" rather than internationally-sanctioned or "recognized" borders.

     From Kevin Kelly's
     <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000093.php">
      review of Centennia
     </a>
     which was published in the
     <i>
      Whole Earth Catalog
     </i>
     :
     <blockquote>
      <i>
       "As a kid I dreamed of maps that would move; I got what I wanted in
Centennia. This colorful political map of Europe and the Mid-East redraws
itself at yearly intervals from the year 1000 to present. It's a living map,
an atlas with the dimension of time. I can zoom around history, pause at
particular dates, or simply watch how nations melt away, or disintegrate
into tiny fragements, or unite! Year by year the outlines of tribes and nations
spread, retreat, and reform almost as if they were tides or infections. The
resolution of detail (almost at the "county" level) is astounding; the breadth
of time (ten centuries) thrilling. It rewards hours and hours of study."

     The
     <i>
      Centennia Historical Atlas
     </i>
     was required reading for all beginning students at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis for over twelve years. Over 1150 copies have been purchased annually for all prospective naval officers at Annapolis. The software serves as a visual introduction to Western History from a cartographic perspective. Centennia is also licensed by hundreds of secondary schools, colleges, and universities worldwide. Editions of the Centennia Atlas are available in Greek and German, as well as English.
     <p>
      Individual home users also purchase the
      <i>
       Centennia Historical Atlas
      </i>
      . It's ideal for anyone who loves maps and history, and it's also extremely popular among genealogy enthusiasts. There's no easier way to get a long-time-scale perspective on the history of the regions of Europe and the Middle East than by watching the borders shift back and forth in Centennia.

      Professor Charles Ingrao, Purdue University wrote:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <i>
       The Centennia Atlas offers an instant antidote to the problem of  changing frontiers.  It permits
you to view any part of Europe, North Africa or the Levant from A.D. 1000 to
[the present].  You can also go forward (or backward) in time, which permits you to see
the map change in five-week intervals for the period and region of your choice.
Centennia also provides a "historical  gazette" and glossary of
names/places that students might find useful.  It even traces the changing
battlefronts between countries in wartime, so you can follow the inexorable
march and retreat of the Austrian armies in the Balkans and elsewhere.  I was
most impressed by the developer's incredible eye for detail, which was more
precise (and often more accurate) than Magocsi's new Historical Atlas of
East Central Europe.  Centennia is no less precise for Germany.  Since much of my earlier work
dealt with the early modern German states, I especially appreciated the
excellent detail that Centennia provides for some of the smaller (but not
the very smallest) Kleinstaaterei.

      The

      software runs under Apple Macintosh OSX (Leopard, Snow Leopard, etc.), as well as Microsoft Windows (8/7/Vista/XP). The software requires 20 megabytes of hard disk space and 40 megabytes of memory. Centennia does not have any other significant system requirements, and it will run well on almost any computer made in the year 2000 or later.
