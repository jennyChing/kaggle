      Depotting MAC Flip-Top Eyeshadows!

    <p>
     I've seen a lot of different guides and instructions for depotting MAC flip-top
eyeshadows, none of which are
     <em>
      quite
     </em>
     what I do.  This series of 
photographs documents my procedure for getting MAC eyeshadows out of those 
little plastic pots and into MAC Pro palettes.  These are the steps I've 
used to remove over 150 eyeshadows from their pots.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without further introduction... 
here we go!

     <b>
      Getting Ready
     </b>
     <br/>
     Gather your supplies.  You will need:  a soft hand towel, a candle (I like 
to use taper candles in a tall, sturdy candlestick), tongs (the ones with 
the hole are
     <em>
      perfect
     </em>
     ), a ballpoint pen (doesn't need to work), a 
thin pointy paring knife (a scalpel or Xacto craft knife will also work), 
and magnets (business card magnets or pre-made
     <a href="http://stainedglassoriginals.com/craftsupplies_accessories.html" target="blank">
      1-inch round ones
     </a>
     ).  Work 
in a well-ventilated area -- I like to do this on top of my glass top 
stove (cool, of course), since it's next to the kitchen fan that vents to 
the outside.  The towel is very
important -- it provides a padded surface that will protect your eyeshadow
from bouncing or breaking if you drop it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip02.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      Pop Out the Plastic Insert
     </b>
     <br/>
     Open the pot above the soft hand towel.  Push the pointy tip of your knife into the groove between the plastic insert and the outside of the pot -- I find that the area near the front latch works well.  Force the knife in gently and wiggle a little until it pops apart.  Don't do this violently or you'll fling that insert across the room!
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip03.jpg" width="400"/>

     <b>
      The Pot and the Insert
     </b>
     <br/>
     Now you've got two pieces:  the outside pot, and the inside plastic insert that holds the metal pan of eyeshadow.  Set that outside pot aside (you'll need it later).
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip04.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      Preparing the Insert
     </b>
     <br/>
     Settle the plastic insert securely inside the tongs.  You can see in the photograph how perfectly those open-wire tongs fit around the insert.  They can hold the outer edges of the plastic insert very tightly without making any contact with the delicate eyeshadow.  The open area on the underside is
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     the area you want to heat with the candle, too.  Hold the bottom of the plastic insert over the candle, in the top of the flame but not completely
     <em>
      in
     </em>
     the flame.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip05.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      Heating the Insert
     </b>
     <br/>
     Here is a side view of the plastic insert over the flame.  As you can see, the tip of the flame is directly on the plastic.  This will create some stinky smoke, so you'll be happiest if you're in an area with adequate ventilation.  Keep the insert over the candle until the bottom is melted.  I like to wait until there's a small hole melted in the insert through which I can just begin to see the metal of the eyeshadow pan.
    </p>

     <b>
      The Melted Insert
     </b>
     <br/>
     Here's a close-up of the melted bottom of the insert.  As you can see, it's no longer shiny... it's bumpy and melted.  And if you look closely, you can see the small dip in the middle where the insert has melted enough to expose a little bit of the underside of the metal pan.   Move quickly (but carefully), because you need to get the pan out before the glue cools again.
    </p>

     <b>
      My "Patented" Technique
     </b>
     <br/>
     Here's the step where my technique tends to differ from the others.  I've tried various ways to remove the pan from the melted insert -- lifting with a knife, using tweezers, etc. -- and this has been, by far, my favorite.  I place the plastic insert eyeshadow-side-down on the towel (this is why you want a soft towel, so it won't damage the eyeshadow).  Then I use the knife (from my insert removal step) to push up on the side of the plastic insert
     <em>
      while simultaneously pushing down on the pan with my ballpoint pen through that little melted hole
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip08.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      A Close-Up on the Technique
     </b>
     <br/>
     Here's a close-up of that step, with labels.  I push
     <strong>
      down
     </strong>
     on the pan through the melted hole with my pen tip, while pushing
     <strong>
      up
     </strong>
     on the side of the plastic insert.  This should easily separate them if the glue is melted.  If the pan does not want to come out, go back and heat it some more.
     <em>
      Don't force it!
     </em>
     The glue should be melted and gooey from the heating, and if it's not, it needs more heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip09.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      The Pan is Out!
     </b>
     <br/>
     Once you've got the pan free of the plastic insert, leave it face-down and let it cool for a minute.  Meanwhile, pop the melted insert back into the pot while it's still warm.  Now the pot is ready for Back-2-MAC!
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip10.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      Removing the Label
     </b>
     <br/>
     Now you're ready to label your pan.  Prepare your magnet.  If you're using 
a business card magnet, cut yourself a piece of magnet that will fit the 
bottom of the pan.  Bigger is better -- it can cover the entire bottom.  
I like to use the label off the bottom of the pot, since it's clearly 
printed and often has the finish (satin, frost, matte, etc.) of the 
eyeshadow printed right below the name.  This label is usually well-stuck 
to the pot and will tear if you try to peel it off.  So, just warm it a 
little to release the adhesive.  I use my tongs again, carefully placing 
one of the bars of the tongs right over the name so it can't get scorched 
by the flame.  Then, gently move the bottom of the pot right over (not in) 
the flame for a few seconds.  Take it out of the tongs and try to peel off 
the label, starting somewhere away from the name (so you don't mess up the 
name in case it tears).  If it won't come off easily, put it back in the 
tongs over the candle.  Peel it off, trim it down to fit your magnet (if necessary), and 
stick it right on.  The glue left on the label should be enough to stick 
it to the magnet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <img align="left" border="1" height="400" src="depot/macfliptop/macflip11.jpg" width="400"/>
     <br/>
     <br clear="all"/>
     <b>
      Almost Done!
     </b>
     <br/>
     Now you've got three pieces:  your pan (now cooled down), your labeled 
magnet, and your empty eyeshadow pot for recycling.  Affix the magnet to 
the bottom of the pan.  Sometimes there will be a bit of excess glue on 
the bottom of the pan -- it's not always enough to stick on a magnet by 
itself, and it's up to you whether you want to clean it off or not.  I'm using a 1-inch round magnet with its own adhesive.

     <b>
      Done!
     </b>
     <br/>
     Stick that magnetized pan into your palette and you're through!  See, that wasn't too hard!  Practice does make perfect, and once you've done a few you'll find a "rhythm" that works for you.  Oh, and in case you were wondering... the eyeshadow depotted in this series of photographs was D'Bohemia, from the D'Bohemia collection in 2005.
