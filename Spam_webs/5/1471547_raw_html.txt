Chartered air travel offers three major benefits for business professionals and managers that commercial air travel simply could not match. This is why corporate customers who actually prefer these options to commercial air travel heavily support the rising trend of charted air travel.
To understand this trend, it is important to understand the grievances of these travelers and how charted flights alleviate these problems.
The most important issue of business travelers is the wasted time at the airports. This time is wasted on waiting for the flight and security lines. This time is wasted because the managers and executives cannot use it for their purpose. In the case of chartered flights, there is no waiting for the flight as the aircraft is at the disposal of the passenger.
In the case of a chartered flight, the passengers are directly taken to the aircraft after security checks. There is no wait because of baggage or other issues that are common in commercial flights.
The common complaint of business travelers is that commercial flights are very uncomfortable and thus they are unable to resume their activities once they land at the destination. A majority of these people require several hours of rest after a flight. This affects their already packed schedules and costs the organization a lot in hotel bills and lost time.
In contrast, charted aircrafts are specifically designed and decorated to be functional office spaces with proper rest areas. The aircrafts often have internet access, telephones and related equipment to make sure that the managers are able to remain productive while in the air. The rest areas offer comfortable opportunities to sleep so that the managers arrive at the destination fresh and ready to go.
Given these benefits, it is easy to see that causes behind the rising trend of charted air travel." name="DESCRIPTION"/>
