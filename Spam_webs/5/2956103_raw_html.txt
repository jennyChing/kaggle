  <meta content="As parents we all want our sons to grow up to be successful and happy in 
their lives. Even though sometimes we think our children listen to us they 
do believe it or not. They do absorb what we tell them as parents and how 
we act. It might take them all they way to their adult hood to realize 
some of things we have been telling them all along. Once they do they will 
start to use some of these things we have been telling them all along. I 
think we all can think about time that we say hey my parents were right 
about this. We have a certain amount of time in their childhood to teach 
them life greatest lessons before they go out into the world. Think about 
what are some of the most important life lessons, morals, values, and 
ethics I can teach my son to ensure when he goes out into the real world he 
survives and does it with a smile on his face. So I have made a list of 13 
of what I think are the best life lessons that boys should be taught by 
their parents in childhood and here it is:

 1. The Value of H ard-work

The value of hard-work is a great one to teach. You have to let them know 
that anything is possible in life, but that have to work hard for it. It is 
not about giving up when things get hard it is sticking with it till you 
see what ever you started through. It is never about taking the easy way 
out or letting someone else do the work for you. It is about giving what 
ever you do in life your 100% all the time. When you accomplish things when 
you have worked hard they mean that much more to you, and have something to 
be really proud of in the end.

2. Forgiveness

Forgiveness is one if you never practice in life is one that makes you 
bitter and angry. Teach them to let go and forgive those who have hurt them 
in life. Not to hold grudges against others or hate in their hearts. Let 
them know the damage that hatred does to them and not the other person. Not 
only that they have to learn to forgive themselves and this one does get 
overlooked sometimes. They have to know that we have to forgive ourselves 
when we have made mistakes. We have to take the lessons we have learned 
from or mistake and then let go. No one is perfect in this world and we all 
make mistakes. Self hatred can be very destructive to a person. They key to 
forgiveness is always knowing we can not go back and change the past we can 
only learn from it, but then we need to move on. Do not ever live your life 
in the past.

3. Kindness

Being kind to others is a great one. Teach them when you walk past someone 
smile. When you see some who is struggling with something offer them to 
help. Volunteer your time or money to great causes when you can. Teach them 
to love others &amp; help others. Teach them not to just worry about themselves 
and what effects their lives.



4. Do Not Let Fear Control Your Life

Teach them not to face their fears and not let their fears control their 
lives. Sometimes the fear of failing stops someone from even trying 
something. The fear of being told no stops someone from even asking. 
Everybody has phobias or things that scare them in their lives teach them 
to face their fears and overcome them. Think about all the opportunities 
you miss out on in life when you let fear control your life.



5. Respect for Women

Teach them to respect women with their words and actions. They should never 
call a women a bad name. Let them know that women are not their object to 
use, walk all over, and take advantage of. They should never raise their 
hands or get physical with a women.



6. Respect their Bodies

Teach them that their bodies is theirs for lives and treat it with respect. 
Teach them to take care of it with hygiene, diet and exercise. Teach them 
about how drugs and alcohol effect their bodies. Let them know how 
permanent changes may seem like a great idea but how would you feel twenty 
years from now about it. Certain piercings, tattoos, and plastic surgeries 
are permanent. You might think it is cool to have tweety bird tattooed on 
your arm now but when you are thirty not so much.



7. Standing up for What is Right

Sometimes in life it is to easy to look the other way and just not fight 
something you know is wrong. We need to teach our sons to stand up and have 
a voice in life make a positive difference. Sometimes it easy to think well 
what can one person do to make a difference, and we need to teach them one 
person can make a difference. One person can start something into action to 
make a change. Teach them not to have the attitude if it does not effect me 
why should I care.



8. Enjoy Life

Yes there is a time for work, but we have to remind our sons there is also 
a time for play. We have to let them know that we all need breaks and to 
simply sit back and have some fun time. We need this breaks in life to 
refocus on the things we need to accomplish or celebrate what we have 
accomplished. We need to this so we do not get burnt out on things in life. 
Simply life is to short to be all work all the time.



9. Do Not Do Things You Would Be Ashamed of Later

We need to remind our sons that we need to do things we are proud to share 
with everybody. We should not be doing things we are not comfortable with 
everybody in the whole world knowing. We should be able to stand behind our 
choices and decisions and not try to hide them. Tell them to ask themselves 
that question I'm going to proud of myself if I do this?



10. The Importance of Family

We need to remind our sons on how truly important family is. Teach them 
that they need to support and love each other no matter what. Let them know 
it is important to show up for family if it is for grandparents, cousins, 
aunts, uncles, siblings, children, nieces, nephews, spouses and parents. If 
they have functions you should cheering for them, celebrating with, and 
congratulating them. If they need your help you should be their for them in 
any way you can. I know sometimes with some family members you have to set 
boundaries with them and that is ok, too. Just love them no matter what.



11. Love

Let your sons know there is people who they love that are going to hurt 
them in their lives. Even when they do get hurt that they do not need to 
close their hearts to love. Teach them to love freely even when they might 
get hurt. If you do not give love a chance you might miss out one of the 
greatest things in your life.



12. Keep a Open Mind

We all get set in our ways and stick to our beliefs. Teach them to keep a 
open mind to new ideas and beliefs. You may never know what you will 
actually find out if you stop and listen to someone, and actually take what 
they are saying into consideration. The thought process that you are always 
right will hurt you in the long wrong.



13. Pity Parties Never Get You Anywhere

Teach your sons that feeling sorry for ourselves never gets us anywhere in 
life. This is the life you were handed and you just have to make the best 
of it. Bad things are going to happen to you, but that should never stop 
you from living. Sometimes you might feel like you have lost everything and 
their is no hope. Teach them to fight for what they want and never give up.



Here is 13 great life lessons that all of us could learn not just our sons. 
I think with these 13 life lessons in their backpacks of life skills they 
will be prepared for a great future out in the real world of life. There 
are many more you could add, but this is a great foundation to start with. 
Life is not really about what you are handed, but how well you deal or cope 
with what you are handed. So lets give our sons some tools to deal and cope 
with it.
