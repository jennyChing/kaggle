           <strong>
            Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a super hero.
            <br/>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I used to dress up like Superman far more often than was considered socially acceptable. I thought the cape on my back would allow me to fly when jumping off things in my backyard. For as long as I can remember, I was always the small and weak kid. I got cut from high school basketball team because I didnt have an ounce of muscle on me. Getting pushed around while playing any sport was a regular occurrence. However, the thought of becoming incredibly strong and powerful was something I left to my imagination while reading books, playing video games, and watching movies.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            A few years back, I finally took steps to get stronger and more confident in my abilities, and became addicted to learning about fitness.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Nerd Fitness was born.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           So, when I started this community, I wondered what I could do to actually BECOME a real life super hero  maybe not in the sense of mutant powers or special abilities, but an alter-ego that was a more badass, confident, and powerful version of myself.
          </p>
          <p>
           My super hero would get to have his own persona, special abilities, theme song, code of honor, and more. It would be through this alter-ego that I could shed my day-to-day life for a few hours and become somebody new.
          </p>
          <p>
           Up until recently I thought I had all of the components of a real life super hero figured out.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            As it turns out, I was leaving out a key piece to the puzzle.
           </em>

           <strong>
            Alright  lets turn you into a super hero!
           </strong>
           Much easier said than done, I know.  Although, Ive already covered many aspects of the super hero lifestyle in previous posts, heres a quick overall recap on becoming superhuman:
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <strong>
            1) Define your origin story.
           </strong>
           Whats that you say? Youre 400 pounds, out of a job, and living in your parents basement? Congratulations  that is your origin story. Here at NF, it doesnt matter where you start,
           <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/about-2/rules-of-the-rebellion/" target="_blank" title="Rebellion">
            only where youre going
           </a>
           . You get to decide what kind of hero you want to become and how youll get there  you get to
           <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/10/21/how-to-write-your-own-epic-destiny/" target="_blank" title="epic destiny">
            write your own epic destiny
           </a>
           . You might not get bitten by radioactive spiders any time soon, but you can still decide that one day youre going to do something great. And you ARE capable of great things.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <strong>
            For example, heres my epic storyline:
           </strong>
           a humble boy from a sleepy fishing village is going to alter the course of history. (
           <em>
            sounds way cooler than a nerd from Sandwich, MA, started a fitness blog because he didnt wanna be weak anymore, right?)
           </em>
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <strong>
            2) Decide your super power.
           </strong>
           What do you want to be good at? Do you want to have super human strength? Lightning quick reflexes? How about an acrobat with the skills of an assassin? Maybe you want to leap tall buildings in a single bound? Whatever it is you want to do, that is now your super power and the skill that you will build your training around. If you need more direction in

           , Im here for ya.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <em>
            Personally, I want to be freakishly strong at body weight exercises, able to work out anywhere and everywhere around the globe.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <strong>
            3) Pick your alter-ego.
           </strong>
           This is the fun part  you get to decide what your super hero character will be called and
           <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/08/26/how-to-become-a-superhero-in-4-easy-steps/" target="_blank" title="become a super hero">
            your persona
           </a>
           . Do you wear a cape? Do you smile? Do you jump around or scream and yell? Whatever it is that you want to become, make a conscious effort each time you work out to go through the physical and mental transformation:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Play your theme song each afternoon as you start your transformation  its like a real life montage!
           </li>
           <li>
            Take the time to visualize your workout and how youre going to get stronger.
           </li>
           <li>
            Change out of your work clothes and put on your super hero uniform.
           </li>
           <li>
            Look in the mirror as your new self, pump yourself up, and then go to work.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <strong>
            You truly get to decide to be whatever you want here  you can be somebody
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             completely
            </span>
            unlike your regular personality.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           By day, Im Steve Kamb, a full-time blogger and all-around goofball who smiles way too much and spends too much time at his computer. Every afternoon though, I transform into the rebel version of myself: a Vibram-wearing, ripped t-shirt-uniformed machine of a rebel that will exercise anywhere and everywhere in a city. I wear a permanent scowl on my face, I jump around like a crazy man in between exercises to psych myself up, and I generally weird everybody out within a 50-foot radius. Its probably best not to disturb me when Im rebel mode.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           <strong>
            4) Decide your code of honor.
           </strong>
           What are you fighting for? Are you fighting for your familys health and safety? Are you fighting to
           <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/03/29/the-captain-america-guide-to-leadership-and-inspiration/" target="_blank" title="Captain America">
            become an inspiration to those around you
           </a>
           ? Do you fight for a better life for yourself? Are you fighting to battle injustice and the overwhelming forces of Overlord Obesity, Captain Corpulent, and The Sloth? Whatever it is  you need to decide why youre doing this.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           Super heroes dont exist for the fun of it  we exist because we are needed. As my buddy Mars says, 
           <a href="http://www.marsdorian.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.marsdorian.com/');" target="_blank" title="mars">
            the world needs you.
           </a>
            Its up to you to start making a difference on this planet  you might not have aspirations to change the world, but you can certainly change your life and influence the lives of the people closest to you.

            If every comic book and super hero movie was just hours of rah rah! you can do it! back-patting and cheering with no challenges or enemies, they would suck:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Oh awesome, he saved a cat from a tree!
           </li>
           <li>
            Oh great, she just received the key to another city from the mayor!
           </li>
           <li>
            Weeeeeeee! Another fun montage of jumping over buildings.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Okay, that last one is always awesomebut the other two will get very boring.

           <strong>
            Fortunately, there is always ONE element in a super hero story, book, or movie that keeps things interesting.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            An arch-nemesis.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           Batman had to rise to the occasion to defeat the Joker. Superman constantly battled Lex Luthor. Captain America had to take down Red Skull. Professor X constantly played a metal chessmatch with his friend-turned-enemy Magneto.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            These super heroes and their arch-nemesis are often cut from the same cloth;
           </strong>
           two peas in a pod that have gone down separate paths. Each super heros arch-nemesis usually knows the heros weakness and exploits it whenever possible. Arch-nemeses always force the good guy to think differently, try new tactics, and push to better themselves in order to prevail and save the day/town/planet/galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yeah, these are often terrible people who do terrible things. However, they also advance the plot, constantly create new scenarios that require the hero to increase his skillz, and ultimately leave the hero a superior and wiser man/woman.
          </p>

           <em>
            Mr. Impossible
           </em>
           . About a year and a half ago, I met Joel when he emailed me out of the blue to say he was a fan of what I was working on with Nerd Fitness  I checked out his site and found that we had a lot in common (just like most hero/arch-nemesis connections):

          <p>
           <strong>
            Somewhere along the way over the past year, Joel and I started making fun of each other on twitter, in email, on Gchat, and on the phoneall in good fun.
           </strong>
           Weve become good friends, but we also hate each other. And its tough for me  I mean how do you insult a guy who consistently posts

          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            @stevekamb still believes theres a monster under his bed
           </li>
           <li>
            @joelrunyon When Joel does yoga, he spends the entire time in childs pose.
           </li>
           <li>
            @stevekamb s favorite movie is The Adventures of Mary Kate &amp; Ashley: The Case of the Fun House Mystery

          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Now, although I make fun of Joel as often as possible (my one of my favorite avoid doing work activities),
           </strong>
           I also really respect him and always look to get his opinion on the direction of my blog, my training, and/or any new projects Im working on.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Why? Because I know Joel will tell me like it is without the candy coating.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I remember calling Joel from New Zealand back in February to ask him about a possible direction I was thinking of taking with Nerd Fitness. Most folks would have probably sugar coated their response to not hurt my feelings or blindly say great idea!; Joel told me straight up it was a bad idea  and it was!
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, besides blogging advice, I also look to Joel for some personal fitness competition. I know that I need to stay in peak physical condition at all times, because I know Ill never hear the end of it from him if out of shape the next time we hang out.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back when we went skydiving in Portland in June, the group was given the opportunity to go up to 17,000 feet (though it was more expensive and we had to wear oxygen masks)  Joel and I looked at each other and both decided that we had to do it  we both knew that if the other said no, it would have been years of torment and insultsso we both said yes.

           Youre supposed to coddle people, tell them its okay to be lazy and blame their problems on anything and everything other than themselves. When people say its too hard or but its different for me or I dont like my job, youre supposed to give them an out and say its okay, at least you tried your best (even though it wasnt your best) or be thankful you have a job in this economy!

          <p>
           I believe everybody needs an arch-nemesis  that friend that will ruthlessly ruthlessly tear you apart instead of just telling you what you want to hear. You need somebody that will yell at you when youre lazy, tell you to suck it up when you complain, and insult you mercilessly when youre not living up to your potential. Personally, Im a big fan of tough love  we all need somebody to slap us in the face and tell us to get your sh** together! We are all capable of great things, so its time to start acting like it.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Heres what you need to look for in your own arch-nemesis:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Somebody who is at a relatable level in their physical or professional lives.
            </strong>
            It doesnt matter if you need to lose weight and your nemesis is trying to gain weight, or one of you is self-employed and the other is climbing the corporate ladder. Whats important is that youre both interested in bettering your life.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Somebody that is driven and competitive
            </strong>
             its no use having an arch-nemesis that is content with sucking at life. You need somebody that desperately wants a better life for himself/herself and his family.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Somebody that

            we all have faults that keep us from leveling up our lives. Make sure your arch-nemesis knows what you struggle with so they can call you out when youre using it as a crutch.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Somebody you trust to tell you the truth.
            </strong>
            You probably already have plenty of people in your life who will support you no matter what and keep you happy. You need somebody thats gonna tell you that youre not living up to your potential, that youre getting complacent, that your idea is pure crap! Tough love for the win!
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Somebody you can have fun with
            </strong>
             although this arch-nemesis will keep you honest and call you out when youre slacking, its also important that you can have fun with them  unless youre really crazy and want to pick somebody you REALLY hatethat might get interesting.
           </li>

             Somebody you can stay in close touch with

             at least once a week. Tell your arch nemesis to hold you accountable for your goals. Tell him/her that youre going to work out three times this week or you will pay him/her 50 bucks and run around your neighborhood in a pink speedo. Your nemesis exists to hold you accountable for your actions or inaction  back when

              What do you fight for?I fight for strength, for endurance, for the ability to succeed despite all obstacles.
             </p>
             <p>
              How will you change the world?I will change the world one deadlift at a time! I seek to educate, inform, and be an example to people about how to eat, lift, live, and overcome obstacles. I want everyone to be the best they can be!
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you already have an arch-nemesis?Yes. It seems like everyone is ready to gang up on me twitter. But specifically, @Crooked and I compete in weightlifting challenges, and @Citabean and I challenge each other in #nerdiness and success in life goals. If I was as awesome as @spezzy, I would challenge her too

              Who is your alter-ego?  Robzilla. Because its like Godzilla, but more personal :)What is your super power?  Unassuming strength. Im very quiet, and have only been living a healthier lifestyle for the last few years, so I think I can be underestimated. Im stronger than what most people would give me credit for, both in attitude and in physicality. (i.e. still a quiet unassuming person, and not quite at the physique I would like, so people are surprised that I can squat more than my body weight).Whats your theme song?  Gave Up  Nine Inch Nails. I know, a song called Gave Up, wtf? I can be a bit stubborn though, and when I hear people say I cant do something, or if theres something Im struggling with, it makes me want it that much more. Nothing makes me want to work out more than when my wife tries to convince me to take a night off. So when I hear I tried, I gave up it just makes me want to go harder. Plus, I dare you to listen to that song and not get pumped.What do you fight for? How will you change the world?  As a kid I played a lot of games and watched a lot of TV. Were talking 6-7 hours a night. It was basically what I did after school. Im here to show people that even though I was lazy as a kid, and hated physical activity, you can still change your lifestyle as you get older and wiser.Do you already have an arch-nemesis?  Do I ever! George Titsworth, or geekintoshape as hes known on the boards. Actually its through the boards that I know him. First off, his last name is Titsworth. Seriously, how can you not hate that. Second, hes a hard man to take down. He survived the hurricanes I sent near his home not too long ago. And I gave him extra work for his run last week and still nothing. Ill get him yet though

              of others and letting friends and family dictate how I lived my life. As
              <br/>
              I was fairly insecure, I let a desire to be liked get in the way of
              <br/>
              doing what I wanted and feeling good about myself. A few months ago, I
              <br/>
              made a decision to be the driving force in my own life, to take action
              <br/>
              and to set my own path. I changed my diet, changed my fitness routine

              reach my destination. The only person who can get in my way and stop me
              <br/>
              from achieving my goals is me. My biggest weakness (Kryptonite,
              <br/>
              perhaps?) is a tendency to procrastinate, to put off for tomorrow what I
              <br/>
              should be doing right now. I know that I dont have to be like this, though; unlike Kryptonite, my weakness is one that I can and will overcome.

              Ready to Blow by KMFDM
              <br/>
              This
              <br/>
              song is a bit intense for some people, but it gets me pumped up like no
              <br/>
              other. Other good training montage songs for when they make the epic
              <br/>
              story of my life into a movie will be Bodies by Drowning Pool and
              <br/>

              What do you fight for? How will you change the world?
              <br/>
              When
              <br/>
              I started out, I fought for me  to reclaim my life and health and to
              <br/>
              get back to a place of feeling good about myself (without doing
              <br/>
              unhealthy things to get me there). Thats still a huge goal for me; I
              <br/>
              dont think anyone can truly be an inspirational superhero who doesnt
              <br/>
              have his or her own life on the right path. In addition to that work in
              <br/>
              progress, a big part of my new alter egos life has been working to save
              <br/>
              the children (with Save the Children). Outside the normal course of my
              <br/>
              day-to-day corporate life, I am volunteering for a nonprofit that I
              <br/>
              respect, admire and trust to create a network of young leaders to do
              <br/>
              fundraising and advocacy on behalf of the organization. We just had our
              <br/>
              first event, a very successful kick-off cocktail party, and Im working
              <br/>
              to put together a board and key committees to move our council in the
              <br/>
              right direction. I know that many people look at the problems facing the
              <br/>
              world and think, Im just one person  what can I really do to make a
              <br/>
              difference? Ultimately, I want this network to both support an
              <br/>
              incredible organization and to prove that one person truly can set the
              <br/>
              ball rolling to change peoples lives for the better.

              Arch-nemesis
              <br/>
              A
              <br/>
              huge part of being involved in a fitness-oriented community is friendly
              <br/>
              competition, and everyone has been engaging in that to varying degrees.
              <br/>
              Im trying to fend off Barbarian Ogres attempts to beat my deadlift
              <br/>
              numbers and Im chasing after Kains accumulated push-up count. My true
              <br/>
              arch-nemesis, though, is TheAnne. We discovered our superpowers (by
              <br/>
              joining the NF community) at the same time and realized that we had a
              <br/>
              number of similar interests. Our conversations about shared passions for
              <br/>
              philanthropy and fitness, however, quickly went sour as our competitive
              <br/>
              natures reared their heads, and now part of my quest entails striving
              <br/>
              to best her in every manner. We mean business about this
              <br/>
              arch-nemesis-ship; theres a Google Document involved.

              What do you fight for? How will you change the world?
              <br/>
              When
              <br/>
              I started out, I fought for me  to reclaim my life and health and to
              <br/>
              get back to a place of feeling good about myself (without doing
              <br/>
              unhealthy things to get me there). Thats still a huge goal for me; I
              <br/>
              dont think anyone can truly be an inspirational superhero who doesnt
              <br/>
              have his or her own life on the right path. In addition to that work in
              <br/>
              progress, a big part of my new alter egos life has been working to save
              <br/>
              the children (with Save the Children). Outside the normal course of my
              <br/>
              day-to-day corporate life, I am volunteering for a nonprofit that I
              <br/>
              respect, admire and trust to create a network of young leaders to do
              <br/>
              fundraising and advocacy on behalf of the organization. We just had our
              <br/>
              first event, a very successful kick-off cocktail party, and Im working
              <br/>
              to put together a board and key committees to move our council in the
              <br/>
              right direction. I know that many people look at the problems facing the
              <br/>
              world and think, Im just one person  what can I really do to make a
              <br/>
              difference? Ultimately, I want this network to both support an
              <br/>
              incredible organization and to prove that one person truly can set the
              <br/>
              ball rolling to change peoples lives for the better.

              A

              huge part of being involved in a fitness-oriented community is friendly
              <br/>
              competition, and everyone has been engaging in that to varying degrees.
              <br/>
              Im trying to fend off Barbarian Ogres attempts to beat my deadlift
              <br/>
              numbers and Im chasing after Kains accumulated push-up count. My true
              <br/>
              arch-nemesis, though, is TheAnne. We discovered our superpowers (by
              <br/>
              joining the NF community) at the same time and realized that we had a
              <br/>
              number of similar interests. Our conversations about shared passions for
              <br/>
              philanthropy and fitness, however, quickly went sour as our competitive
              <br/>
              natures reared their heads, and now part of my quest entails striving
              <br/>
              to best her in every manner. We mean business about this
              <br/>
              arch-nemesis-ship; theres a Google Document involved.

              What do you fight for? How will you change the world? I fight for a world a world where I and anyone else with mental illness can thrive instead of survive. A healthier body means a healthier mind and exercise means endorphins and better sleep. I want to be less unhappy, with more regulated moods, with less fear, with the ability to fall asleep and to wake up, and a healthier relationship with food. Maybe, just maybe, if I can manage all of those things, then I can help someone else make their life better too.

              Do you already have an arch-nemesis? Im definitely going to head to the Nerd Fitness forums to try to find a real arch-nemesis, but for now I imagine my many amazing rugby coaches calling my bullshit, pushing me as hard as I can go and congratulating me when I do well.

              The
              <br/>
              Brain began as a chronically ill girl who one day had enough of bowing down to
              <br/>
              Conventional Wisdom and decided to take her health and future into her own
              <br/>
              hands. She uses lightening fast reading/comprehension (necessary to battle the
              <br/>
              naysayers with facts and truths) and indomitable will power to change not only
              <br/>
              her story, but also the stories of those around her. She fights for her health,
              <br/>
              and for the health of those around her. Obesity and apathy are pervasive and
              <br/>
              widespread in this world, and the worst part is that both are completely
              <br/>
              preventable! She fights for accountability and the eradication of excuses. She
              <br/>
              fights to make this world a better one, one person at a time. She changes the
              <br/>
              world through her attitude and knowledge (earning an MPH in community health
              <br/>
              education with a specialization in obesity and nutrition doesnt hurt either!).
              <br/>
              Every day, Miss Moneypenny transforms from a smiley, quiet student into the
              <br/>
              fierce, tough superhero The Brain with a little help from Eminems Till I
              <br/>
              Collapse (because giving up is NEVER an option) and her arch-nemesises: the
              <br/>
              apathy that invades this world (its true that she must be the change she wishes
              <br/>
              to see in the world, and she is making a difference through the strength of her
              <br/>
              willpower), and her brother (who is nearly as competitive as The Brain, and as
              <br/>
              such takes fitness to a whole new and much-needed level). Long Live The
              <br/>
              Rebellion!

              Who is your alter-ego?
              <br/>
              Monkey-Man! Its what a few special ladies in my life call me, and I think it fits. After all, I do like to throw my own bodyweight around (my training includes a lot of press ups and pull-ups), and I like to have fun while Im doing it!

             <p>
              What is your super power?
              <br/>
              Speed, strength, endurance, and power. None of these attributes are superhuman, but theyre all there, and I can adapt to pretty much any situation.
             </p>
             <p>
              What is your theme song?
              <br/>
              Dragon Soul http://youtu.be/jcx-OurFpaM  what could get me more pumped than one of the intros to the best anime of all time? The songs all about stuff like not being scared, protecting others, being optimistic and never ceasing to seek excellence.
             </p>
             <p>
              What do you fight for? How will you change the world?
              <br/>
              I fight for two major reasons:
              <br/>
              1. For those who cant  my sister is permanently wheelchair-bound, and cant take care of herself. She has spent her life being unable to do a lot of things that other people can do. I was blessed with the power to do these things, to waste it would be a shame. She inspires me to be the best I can be, because I have opportunities and abilities that should not be taken for granted.
              <br/>
              2. To inspire  I was an overweight kid, and struggled with eating disorders throughout high school. Ive overcome my health problems, both physical and mental, and I want to show people that they can do the same.Ill change the world by spreading my knowledge and always helping those in need of help or advice.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you already have an arch-nemesis?
              <br/>
              My arch-nemesis is a growing army of people known as The Negatives. They like to claim that they could never or cant do something to change the sad state that theyre in. They then try to bring me down for doing what I do. I value optimism, persistence, and hard work, while they favor sloth and excuses. My ultimate goal is to convert the Negatives into more positive people, and show them that anyone can be a superhero if they just try.

              I come from a house that has no objective beyond watching reruns of ghost hunters and stuffing your face with as much tasty greasy food as possible. I loved it and I watched T.V. and played arkham asylum with the best of them.  I always wanted to get in better shape and have a better life but never thought of a direction to take.  I took a job on a coastal town at a motel hoping to find some inspiration miles away from my xbox360.  Out here it dawned on me how much time in the day there is and how much of it I was wasting.  That day I realized if I put down the batman game and comic book and spent all day becoming stronger learning more about the world around me and trying to make it a better place Id be living a life worthy of the batman myth.  I then became
              <br/>
              It was then I discovered my power. I have failed a lot in life and I will fail some more, but I adapt. When im weak I do push ups,w hen I dont know I look for the awnser, my power is the thirst to achieve something new everyday. I found in myself a man who wanted to help people in his community and currently my energy and focus centers around studying to become  an EMT and eventually a fire fighter. Way down the line after I have my black belt in BJJ I want to set up a a center where kids lacking in direction can come learn there skills study for school in a room off to the side designated for academic indevors and generally be around the people I wish could have guided me when I was younger
              <br/>
              From my desire to help my fellow man, my love of martial arts, and the belief that all people on this world are better then theythink they truly are I found my identity. I am the Quixotic, an idealist with no regard for reality. My theme song is the Title song to the show Man of La Mancha the story of Don Quixote.
              <br/>
              I have not found my arch nemesis but I am always keeping my eyes open for that worthy adversary.

              Ok heroes. My father and I are going to do this together. We set goals,
              <br/>
              our weaknesses and abilities, stories, etc. Its a little delayed, but
              <br/>
              part of it was going through it this weekend with my father. So, here we
              <br/>
              go  the Scout and the Equalizer! We both have been struggling with a lot of things lately, so we are taking NerdFitness superhero contest as an opportunity to be side kicks in our battle(s) against ourselves, social injustice, our faith, and personal and professional weaknesses. As we are side kicks, more than nemisis, that term is mis-used, but go with me on this one.
             </p>
             <p>
              And away we go.

              On
              <br/>
              a cold day in January, a man is born in the snowy backdrop of a small
              <br/>
              mountain town in the Pacific Northwest. With a working-class patriarch
              <br/>
              and a blue collar attitude, he is bred in a humble, but suitable
              <br/>
              incubator that brings a dedication to helping those around him. From
              <br/>
              this home, he is to rise and become the EQUALIZER.
              <br/>
              Who is your alter-ego?
             </p>
             <p>
              The
              <br/>
              Equalizer is a dedicated, hardworking member of the financial services
              <br/>
              industry. Devoted husband and proud father of two sons (eldest being
              <br/>
              SCOUT), he finds satisfaction in the knowledge that his life has and
              <br/>
              will contribute to the benefit of others.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although
              <br/>
              being a member of the now ill-received financial industry, dawning his
              <br/>
              business-casual wear, he is to infiltrate the wealthy communities and is
              <br/>
              keenly aware of how those possessing wealth are often times in control
              <br/>
              of local decision making in the community. This modern-day Robin Hood
              <br/>
              is not politically aligned or connected, he stands in the corner of the
              <br/>
              common man by being the voice of equality for all concerned.
             </p>
             <p>
              Abilities: Heightened sense of peoples intentions; ability to see through attempts to    deceive the public.
             </p>
             <p>
              Weaknesses: Diminished ability to say no to people who request help.

              The
              <br/>
              Equalizer fights for everyone in the community, regardless of financial
              <br/>
              or social status to have a voice in the direction of the community.
              <br/>
              While typically mild mannered, the Equalizer becomes vocal when
              <br/>
              witnessing abuses of those of means. By removing money from the decision
              <br/>
              making process, he succeeds in promoting a community-based decision
              <br/>
              making process. When the voices of all people are heard, it can change
              <br/>
              the world.
              <br/>
              Fight for: The oppressed and those in need a voice in the communities in which they live.

              Origin Story
             </p>
             <p>
              A country boy is born under the
              <br/>
              sweltering, Idaho sun. Son of the Equalizer, he is to rise as the prodigal
              <br/>
              son and use his analytical and sensing abilities to bring together a community
              <br/>
              of heroes and foster justice in a broken universe.
             </p>
             <p>
              Who is your
              <br/>
              alter-ego?
             </p>
             <p>
              Our hero spends his days as a young
              <br/>
              attorney. He is from a strong family of complimentary powered super heroes 
              <br/>
              his brother an axe bearer, his father the mage, and his mother the spell
              <br/>
              caster. This first born son, is asked to shoulder the scionology of a
              <br/>
              family, overcome the hurdles of the large city, and recruit new heroes to
              <br/>
              the Crew. The Crew now only consists of the four family
              <br/>
              members, but his efforts in the large city are in attempts to gather more like
              <br/>
              him. In doing so, he uses his hyper sensitive powersthe ability to
              <br/>
              sense the emotions of any one person within his sight (this power is
              <br/>
              limitedhe can only sense one emotion of one person at a time, kind of like a
              <br/>
              mood ring). Although his weakness is his physical stature and strength,
              <br/>
              his hyper-vigilance, sensing abilities, and intelligence, coupled with a
              <br/>
              blinding, short-sprint-like speed, make him the ultimate recruiter.

              <br/>
              analytical skills; d. short, sprint-like speed; e. social skillz; and f. wields the medicine ball o might!
             </p>
             <p>
              Weaknesses:
              <br/>
              Physical strength and stature.

             </p>
             <p>
              Although the Scout can use his
              <br/>
              powers without modifying his dress, appearance, or general demeanor, he much
              <br/>
              prefers dawning his grey hooded sweatshirt, much like a boxer, and jeans.
              <br/>
              With a nice overcoat and killer kicks, he is able to blend in at most social
              <br/>
              settings. Changing from his business casual attire, the Scouts abilities
              <br/>
              become much more acute. In modifying his dress, often with a nice
              <br/>
              accessory, like a casual, but accessible, watch or other time piece, he jams
              <br/>
              out to the Sims Burn it Down.

              What do you fight
              <br/>
              for? How will you change the world?
             </p>
             <p>
              The Scout not only fights for
              <br/>
              community action, but he will change the world by creating social awareness of
              <br/>
              various topics, including the lack of mentorship and positive leaders for young
              <br/>
              men who have no fathers. In doing so, the Scout spends his free time,
              <br/>
              when he is not recruiting for the Crew, with youth through coaching
              <br/>
              and umpiring sports leagues. In the shadows of his father, the mage, who
              <br/>
              is an all-start baseball umpire, the Scout hopes to rise and become an elite
              <br/>
              and positive example to youth.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, the Scout is in physical training. Under the guidance of his much
              <br/>
              stronger, albeit less aware, brother, the axe bearer, he is engaged in an
              <br/>
              intense weight gain program that requires him to consume large amounts of
              <br/>
              deceased animals on a daily basis and lift heavy objects. In doing so,
              <br/>
              however, he has found himself especially skilled in wielding the medicine ball
              <br/>
              of might, a tool in which he may use to smash opponents, should his speed and
              <br/>
              mind fail him. His weakness here, however, is ability is limited by the
              <br/>
              weight of the ball  he may only use it once for every battle with the Crews
              <br/>
              enemies; therefore, he must be wise in its use.
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              Fight for: a. Awareness/voluntary public
              <br/>
              service of lack of mentoring for young men, especially those without a
              <br/>
              father/older brother/mentor; b. keep the Crew together; c. create social
              <br/>
              network of like-minded individuals for the greater good of the community
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you already have
              <br/>
              an arch-nemesis?
             </p>
             <p>
              The Scout knows his nemisis, because
              <br/>
              he sprung from his loinsthe Equalizer. He does not believe the Equalizer to
              <br/>
              be a nemisis, but a driving force. The Equalizer is not as physically
              <br/>
              strong as the Scout, but his mental skills are far advancedhe cannot only
              <br/>
              sense emotion of multiple individuals simultaneously, he can read animals
              <br/>
              minds and, if needed, control them. The Equalizer pushes the Scout on a day to
              <br/>
              day basis as they are able to connect for their Crew Executive
              <br/>
              Meetings to discuss recruiting matters and matters of the Crew family
              <br/>
              expansion.
             </p>
             <p>
              The father-son relationship has been through many trials and triumphs, but
              <br/>
              resounds in love and respect.
             </p>
             <p>
              Until then, the Scout remains the prodigal son, only to traverse the large city
              <br/>
              in valiant attempts to better himself mentally, socially and physically.
