               Nils Gilman describes deviant globalization as "the unpleasant underside of transnational integration."
               <br/>
               <br/>
               There's nice tourism, and then sex tourism, such as in Thailand and Switzerland. The vast pharmacology industry is matched by a vast traffic in illegal drugs. The underside of waste disposal is the criminal dumping in the developing world of toxic wastes from the developed world. Military activities worldwide are fed by a huge gray market in weapons. Internet communications are undermined by floods of malware doubling every year. Among the commodities shipped around the world are exotic hardwoods, endangered species, blood diamonds, and stolen art worth billions in ransom. Illegitimate health care includes the provision of human organs from poor people -- you can get a new kidney with no waiting for $150,000 in places like Brazil, the Philippines, Istanbul, and South Africa. Far overwhelming legal immigration are torrents of illegal immigrants who pay large sums to get across borders. And money laundering accounts for 4-12% of world GDP -- $1.5 to 5 trillion dollars a year.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               These are not marginal, "informal" activities. These are enormous, complex businesses straight out of the
               <i>
                Harvard Business Review
               </i>
               . The drug business in Mexico, for example, employs 400,000 people. A thousand-dollar kilo of cocaine grows in value by 1400-percent when it crosses into the U.S. -- nice profit margin there.

                Author Nils Gilman traces cocaine sales from production to retail, noting the profit margin is highest at the stage of U.S. importation due to increased regulatory pressure from narcotics agents.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The DEA "think they're in the drug eradication business," says Gilman. "They're actually in the drug regulation business."

                Author Nils Gilman argues the black market isn't necessarily a bad thing. "If you like entrepreneurship, if you like innovation," says Gilman, "then you've got to love deviant globalization."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The narcotics industry in Mexico, for example, directly employees 400,000 people -- more than finance or oil.

      Hi, I'm Alexander Rose, the executive director at the Long Now Foundation. Every month we

      They seem to be all coming in as time lapses at this point. But, this month we do have a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_3">
      time lapse, but it is a reverse time lapse. This was done by the folks at the Chicago

     </span>
     <span id="tr_7">
      can now re-create them with genetic engineering. Their fur has been collected from the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_8">
      ice and DNA in there is attack, the idea is to collect some of that, blended with

      in the bay area a couple of months ago was a meeting at UC Berkeley, I forget what the

     <span id="tr_12">
      title was, but the subject was applied history. Basically, addressing the idea that what
     </span>
     <span id="tr_13">
      if policy makers actually talked to historians when they made decisions. They talk to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_14">
      economists and get misled. They talk to themselves in terms of what they learned 40 years

     </span>
     <span id="tr_17">
      seldom like that so they make bad decisions because they never talk to historians. So we
     </span>
     <span id="tr_18">
      had a gathering of historians to think through what historians might bring to the policy

      talking about six ways to learn from history. And one of them is here tonight. Nils

      Gilman was trained as an historian at Cal. I've work would not only in that conference
     </span>

      but on many things that we have done at global business network. And what I think is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_23">
      exceptionally interesting, when people think about global business, after that matter

     <span id="tr_26">
      overlooking the billion people that live in squattered cities and slums. And a few years
     </span>
     <span id="tr_27">
      ago when Rob North came through and talked about squatter cities, it was like, wow, there
     </span>
     <span id="tr_28">
      is another whole civilization scale metabolism going on out there that we are not taking
     </span>
     <span id="tr_29">
      into account. Nils Gilman has something like that for you tonight. Please welcome him.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_30">
      NILS GILMAN: Thank y'all for coming. Well, in the interest of trying to contextualize
     </span>
     <span id="tr_31">
      this talk, let me talk about a little bit where I came with these set of ideas from to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_32">
      begin with. My first book which came out about seven years ago was intellectual history
     </span>
     <span id="tr_33">
      of something called modernization theory. About the 1940s through the 1970s modernization
     </span>
     <span id="tr_34">
      theory framework that US foreign policy makers and foreign policy intellectuals used to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_35">
      think about what they hoped they could achieve in what they call the third world, and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_36">
      today I'll be referring to as the global south. Modernization theory argued that the goal
     </span>
     <span id="tr_37">
      development both normatively and imperially was for other countries to essentially
     </span>
     <span id="tr_38">
      emulate the historical path of the United States. The idea was that if we encouraged each
     </span>
     <span id="tr_39">
      individual country to create a strong public goods providing, welfare providing,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_40">
      industrial democracy, this would eventually create an international community of like
     </span>
     <span id="tr_41">
      minded states who would compete at a business level but would be bound together in an
     </span>
     <span id="tr_42">
      actualization of dream of perpetual peace. This was kind of the dominant idea about where
     </span>
     <span id="tr_43">
      developments was going during the first half of the Cold War. It is pretty obvious this
     </span>
     <span id="tr_44">
      vision didn't pan out. All you have to do is read the newspaper to know that the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_45">
      south, much of the global south anyways the languish in poverty, oppression and in many
     </span>
     <span id="tr_46">
      cases conflicts humanitarian emergencies. Basically by the 1990s, when the Cold War was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_47">
      over modernization at least as an official doctrine, had long since been abandoned in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_48">
      much of the world, and it had been replaced by what we now refer to structural adjustment
     </span>
     <span id="tr_49">
      programs which basically focused on downsizing social support systems, and this produced
     </span>
     <span id="tr_50">
      various forms of semi-permanent marginality relative to the industrial core of the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_51">
      north. That is sort describe in my first book. That marked that history from about the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_52">
      1940s through about the 1990s. After I was done writing that book, I was still left with
     </span>
     <span id="tr_53">
      some nagging questions, which was what happens to people after they give up on the dream
     </span>
     <span id="tr_54">
      of modernization or after the dream of modernization gives up on them? What happens when
     </span>
     <span id="tr_55">
      people stop thinking their states, or at least trying to provide them with the frame work
     </span>
     <span id="tr_56">
      where they can work hard, keep their noses clean and get ahead? What happens especially
     </span>
     <span id="tr_57">
      when people confront the realty like that in the context of increasingly globalized
     </span>
     <span id="tr_58">
      economic system? I didn't have any answers to this. But this was sort of the last
     </span>
     <span id="tr_59">
      question I was left with at the end of the book. So this was one set of concerns that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_60">
      came out of my academic interest. The second -- this set of academic questions then
     </span>
     <span id="tr_61">
      merged with another set of questions which had been really been the focus or a primary
     </span>
     <span id="tr_62">
      focus of my business consulting practice which deals with emerging security threats of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_63">
      one sort or another. And Monitor 360, which is my outfit, we look at big intractable
     </span>
     <span id="tr_64">
      security problems and we try to find new ways to conceptualize them, to reframe them,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_65">
      confront them, hopefully, solve them. We ask questions like the war on drugs. Failed
     </span>
     <span id="tr_66">
      states. How they fit together? And what are the better ways to try and conceptualize the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_67">
      relationships between them? As it turned out as we were looking across one incident after
     </span>
     <span id="tr_68">
      another that has been taking place over the last 15-20, we saw at the root of many of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_69">
      these issues were trades and illicit commodities. This was true whether it was blood
     </span>
     <span id="tr_70">
      diamonds or blood oil creating horrible civic conflicts in Africa, it was true if we
     </span>
     <span id="tr_71">
      looked at the war on drugs and the way that was providing a prop for regimes like the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_72">
      Taliban in Afghanistan back in the 1990s or the fork in Columbia, where the drug war was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_73">
      going on in Mexico right now. We also looked at things like the sanction busting scandals
     </span>
     <span id="tr_74">
      that happened around Iraq and the UN oil for food program prior to the invasion of Iraq
     </span>
     <span id="tr_75">
      in 2003. And we even looked at things like evolution of improvised explosive devices in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_76">
      the combat theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan and these things had been sourced, as many of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_77">
      you know, as the majority of coalition casualties over the last seven years. This is what
     </span>
     <span id="tr_78">
      we refer to as intractable problems or dilemmas. And we feel like the (inaudible). In
     </span>
     <span id="tr_79">
      globalization is one that really helps us make some sense of that. So these two streams
     </span>
     <span id="tr_80">
      of thought came together a couple of years when I taught in the course I taught, with a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_81">
      couple of my colleagues at Berkeley, Steve Weber and Jessie Goldhammer, on the topic of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_82">
      what I am now calling deviant globalization. What united all these extra legal commodity
     </span>
     <span id="tr_83">
      flows which unpinned so many of these current emerging security threats was the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_84">
      unsanctioned circulation of goods and services that either because of the way they are
     </span>
     <span id="tr_85">
      produced or because of the way they are consumed violates someone's ethical
     </span>
     <span id="tr_86">
      sensibilities. That course then prompted us to put together a book on the topics which
     </span>
     <span id="tr_87">
      will be coming in the fall, which consisted of a collection of essays written mostly by
     </span>
     <span id="tr_88">
      journalists mostly academics that basically look at a variety of individual instances,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_89">
      and I'll be talking about most of these over the course of the talk today, whether it is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_90">
      the drug trade or the sex trade or human trafficking or the global circulation of human
     </span>
     <span id="tr_91">
      organs or what have you. A series of articles coming out on that. But we also try, and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_92">
      I'm going to try to summary the discussion here today, to see whether there are emerging
     </span>
     <span id="tr_93">
      patterns that we can find across these different illicit market places, whether there are

     <span id="tr_94">
      certain structural common patterns, in that, think of what it all kind of means in terms
     </span>
     <span id="tr_95">
      of global politics and the future development in the global south. That is what I'm going
     </span>
     <span id="tr_96">
      to try to talk about today. So first, what is deviant globalization? Deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_97">
      globalization in a word is the unpleasant under site of globalization. For every
     </span>
     <span id="tr_98">
      legitimate industry that is out there, there's a deviant counterpart. Let me give a few
     </span>
     <span id="tr_99">
      examples. Tourism, obviously, this is a poster child for globalization. Something like a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_100">
      $300 billion a year industry, globally, and of course, there is a deviant counterpart to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_101">
      it. In the sex tourism industry, there is literally millions of men every year, and a few
     </span>
     <span id="tr_102">
      women also, who annually try to places like Thailand to Jamaica to the Netherlands, to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_103">
      Cuba, to the Philippines to enjoy sexual pleasures that are presumptively are unavailable
     </span>
     <span id="tr_104">
      to them in their home countries. Likewise you look at the pharmaceutical industry, there
     </span>
     <span id="tr_105">
      is a deviant counterpart in the narcotics trade. Drugs illicit drugs, with possible
     </span>
     <span id="tr_106">
      exception of oil, the single most globalized business in the world. Worth somewhere
     </span>
     <span id="tr_107">
      between a quarter and half a trillion dollars a year. Waste disposal. It has a deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_108">
      counterpart in what we may call toxic dumping. Sometimes illicitly, just as often legally
     </span>
     <span id="tr_109">
      under the guys of recycling, quote/unquote, global north ships literally millions of tons
     </span>
     <span id="tr_110">
      of toxic waste battery, chemical, end of life merchant ships and so on, to the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_111">
      south, where it provides incomes for many of the people who find ways to reuse these
     </span>
     <span id="tr_112">
      materials but also causes massive physical and environmental insults for the countries
     </span>
     <span id="tr_113">
      that receive these goods. Just to give you a flavor for what I'm talking about, some of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_114">
      you may have heard of the Trafigura case, this involved an Anglo-Dutch company,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_115">
      Trafigura, which in the summer of 2006 had a ship cargo full of extremely toxic waste in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_116">
      one sort or another that it was trying to get rid of. This ship literally sailed all over
     </span>
     <span id="tr_117">
      different European ports trying to find somebody who would take on these chemicals. And
     </span>
     <span id="tr_118">
      they were being told they would have to pay something like $100 million to take these
     </span>
     <span id="tr_119">
      chemical and dispose of them legally in Europe. Needless to say, the company was not too
     </span>
     <span id="tr_120">
      pleased about having to pay that kind of rate, so what they did, was they managed to find
     </span>
     <span id="tr_121">
      a gentleman in Cote d'Ivoire who set up a shell company, and who offered to buy this from
     </span>
     <span id="tr_122">
      them for a million. So they sailed this ship down, in the dark of night, quite literally,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_123">
      unloaded all this merely on to barges in the port and sailed away. In the meanwhile, this
     </span>
     <span id="tr_124">
      fellow took all this stuff and simply dumped it into the sewers and waterways. The result
     </span>
     <span id="tr_125">
      was not only incredibly horribly smelling mess, apparently the stuff that was in this
     </span>
     <span id="tr_126">
      cargo hold is the stinkiest stuff in the world apparently there scientists out there that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_127">
      measure stinkynism and this is the stinkiest stuff. So the whole city stank, but it was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_128">
      extremely toxic. Over 100 thousand people had to seek medical assistance and, in fact,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_129">
      several dozen people died as a result of this. So that is an example of deviant waste
     </span>
     <span id="tr_130">
      disposal. Then there's the military which takes the forms of arms trafficking. Arms
     </span>
     <span id="tr_131">
      dealing is needless to say the lynchpin of so many of the so called new wars that have
     </span>
     <span id="tr_132">
      been ruling much of the world from Afghanistan to Burma all across Africa. These weapons
     </span>
     <span id="tr_133">
      sometimes reach their recipients through black-markets but more commonly there is a kind
     </span>
     <span id="tr_134">
      of gray market that is going on here where militaries from nation states are interested
     </span>
     <span id="tr_135">
      in supporting some rebel group or another, usually indirectly and by the way, a lot of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_136">
      these military officers are interested in making a dollar on the side, and so weapons off
     </span>
     <span id="tr_137">
      the back of a truck and end up in the hands of some resistance group. And I think, most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_138">
      of you will either remember or have read about the Iran contra-scandal back in the 1980s,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_139">
      classic example of this. US, Congress had said we couldn't support the contras directly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_140">
      and so we sold weapons to the Israelis who shipped them to the Iranians who gave money to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_141">
      the Israelis who Iranians who gave the money to the contras. So that they could fight an
     </span>
     <span id="tr_142">
      insurgency against the regime in Nicaragua. Classic case of deviant globalization. More
     </span>
     <span id="tr_143">
      recent example, some of you may have seen the Nicolas Cage film, Lord of the War, which
     </span>
     <span id="tr_144">
      was a dramatization of the life -- well a loosely based on the life of the Ukrainian arms
     </span>
     <span id="tr_145">
      dealer Victor Booth who was probably the biggest single arms trafficker of the last 15

      years got arrested about a year ago in Thailand and he has been fighting expedition into
     </span>
     <span id="tr_147">
      the U.S. ever since then. Then there is commodities. Commodities is obviously a lynchpin
     </span>
     <span id="tr_148">
      at the global economy, circulation of oil, metals, goods, and stuff like that but, it
     </span>
     <span id="tr_149">
      also takes deviant forms. This is partly illegally harvested commodities, but one of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_150">
      things that is worth thinking of specifically is exotic wildlife tracking which is a much
     </span>
     <span id="tr_151">
      bigger business than what you might expect. Whether it is European wildlife collectors
     </span>
     <span id="tr_152">
      looking to round out their collection of Komodo dragons, that would cost you $30,000 or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_153">
      $30,000 Chinese men looking for powdered rhinoceros horn, that is about $1,500 or San

      Francisco, interior designers who are looking to get you a better price on your Brazilian
     </span>
     <span id="tr_155">
      hardwood floor, there's a enormous industry in harvesting the circulating many specialty
     </span>
     <span id="tr_156">
      natural goods, many of which are from highly endangered species or even or ecosystems. In
     </span>
     <span id="tr_157">
      fact, illicit commerce, this brings up a very important point about deviant globalization
     </span>
     <span id="tr_158">
      which is that illicit commerce in otherwise legal commodities almost certainly dwarfs the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_159">
      size of purely illegal market despite the size of the drug market. So trafficking under
     </span>
     <span id="tr_160">
      the radar of goods like timber or oil, or minerals or diamonds these things are huge
     </span>
     <span id="tr_161">
      sources of illicit revenues for people in the global system. Perhaps one of the most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_162">
      disturbing deviant globalization deviant health care. So with the invention of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_163">
      Cyclosporin in the late 1970s and then being brought to market in the early 1980 said,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_164">
      Cyclosporin is basically a drug that suppresses the immune of rejection response for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_165">
      organ transplants. All of a sudden organ transplantation went from something that was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_166">
      unusual last ditch kind of procedure in 1960s and '70s, something that became very
     </span>
     <span id="tr_167">
      mainstream in the 1980s and 1990s. I suspect almost somebody in this audience who has a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_168">
      transplanted organ. Unfortunately, there's a huge gab between a demand for these organs
     </span>
     <span id="tr_169">
      and the supply of these organs. In most of the global north, organs are supplied from
     </span>
     <span id="tr_170">
      cadavers and people have to be opt in to being a organ donor. The result is there is just
     </span>
     <span id="tr_171">
      not enough organs relative to the number of people who are demanding organs. Of course,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_172">
      the demand for organs has increased steadily over the years as populations age, as the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_173">
      amount of hypertension patients age, and so there has been a steady increase in demand
     </span>
     <span id="tr_174">
      but not much of an increase in supply. The result is many people languish many years on a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_175">
      waiting list, waiting on somebody to motorcycle crash so they can get an organ. But there
     </span>
     <span id="tr_176">
      is an another option. As people get desperate, going through dialysis for many hours
     </span>
     <span id="tr_177">
      three time as week, four times a week it becomes a more and more reasonable option for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_178">
      them to consider which is that you can fly today to a variety of places in the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_179">
      south and buy yourself an organ. Well you don't have to do it yourself, an organ broker
     </span>
     <span id="tr_180">
      will take care of it for you. And for about $150 thousand, you can get yourself a new
     </span>
     <span id="tr_181">
      kidney. The organ donor themselves don't get that much, they typically get 1-10,000 of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_182">
      those $150 thousand. Another thing that is interesting about the global circulation of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_183">
      organs there is -- it is not a completely globalized market place. There are several
     </span>
     <span id="tr_184">
      regional market places. So the U.S. most common place for U.S. organ donors or recipient
     </span>
     <span id="tr_185">
      in this market place to go is the Philippines and Brazil. The Philippines and the Brazil,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_186">
      they actually source their organs locally. They are local donors mostly. For the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_187">
      Europeans, most popular place is Istanbul and South Africa. In South Africa they mostly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_188">
      fly in Brazilians to be organ donors because Europeans are afraid of getting African
     </span>
     <span id="tr_189">
      organs because of HIV, but there may be other reasons there. In East Asia it is a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_190">
      different market place. The focus there, there are a lot of organ transplant facilitates
     </span>
     <span id="tr_191">
      in South Asia. Many in India, specifically, and they get a lot of their organs locally.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_192">
      There's also a lot of Chinese and Japanese businessman that go to the Philippines like
     </span>
     <span id="tr_193">
      Americans do to get these organs. There's a complex global network of these organ dealers
     </span>
     <span id="tr_194">
      supplying and demanding these organs. Well there's also the software industry, obviously,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_195">
      another big globalized industry. I'll be talking about this a little bit more later. But
     </span>
     <span id="tr_196">
      the obvious, deviant counterpart to the software industry is the MALWARE industry. Stands
     </span>
     <span id="tr_197">
      for malicious software, this is trogons, viruses, things that take over your computer
     </span>
     <span id="tr_198">
      that steal your data personal data or turn your computer into a zombie so they can run
     </span>
     <span id="tr_199">
      spam and so on. Then there's immigration. Immigration of human trafficking. An estimated
     </span>
     <span id="tr_200">
      3-4 million people annually illegal immigrant from one country to another or at least
     </span>
     <span id="tr_201">
      without formal license from one country to another. And these movements are facilitated
     </span>
     <span id="tr_202">
      by a huge network of brokers and logistic professionals who for a fee will help move you
     </span>
     <span id="tr_203">
      from wherever you want to go to wherever else you want to go. So for example, today
     </span>
     <span id="tr_204">
      people pay between 30,000 to 17,000 dollars to be moved from China to the United States
     </span>
     <span id="tr_205">
      usually through Mexico these days. They were coming through Europe until a couple of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_206">
      years ago. But Mexico is the main transition point. Some of the Mexican drug cartels sort
     </span>
     <span id="tr_207">
      of diversify their business by getting into the human trafficking thing. If you want to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_208">
      get from Cuba to the U.S. that would cost you about $10,000 which is actually the same
     </span>
     <span id="tr_209">
      price that a gang of Iraqis were charging to be transported from Baghdad to Great
     </span>
     <span id="tr_210">
      Britain. So there's again, all sort of global networks brokered by people who are willing
     </span>
     <span id="tr_211">
      to make these things happened. And finally, most importantly there's the deviant finance
     </span>
     <span id="tr_212">
      industry, otherwise known as money laundering. The reason why this might be the most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_213">
      important industry is this is the industry that allows all these other guys who are doing
     </span>
     <span id="tr_214">
      this illicit stuff to bring their money back into the day light. So basically, the size
     </span>
     <span id="tr_215">
      of the deviant finance industry is at least equal to all the other deviant industries put
     </span>
     <span id="tr_216">
      together. I'll mention this later, but estimates of the size of the money laundering
     </span>
     <span id="tr_217">
      industry globally arranged range between 1.5 and $5 trillion annually. So that is between
     </span>
     <span id="tr_218">
      4 and 12 percent of GDP globally. So it is a pretty significant business. This is not an
     </span>
     <span id="tr_219">
      exhaustive list of deviant industries. There are many other illicit market places most of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_220">
      which are thoroughly globalized. Another one that I just learned about recently is that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_221">
      the third largest illicit market place in terms of cash transfers and the third after
     </span>
     <span id="tr_222">
      drugs and human trafficking is the stolen art market. It is worth an estimated $10
     </span>
     <span id="tr_223">
      billion a year. There are whole law firms in the United States, UK and in France whose
     </span>
     <span id="tr_224">
      business is focused exclusively discretely arranging the necessary ransoms to get your
     </span>
     <span id="tr_225">
      stolen art back. Again, these guys don't want to publicize what they are actually paying
     </span>
     <span id="tr_226">
      for these things, you need to look at the numbers skeptically, but it is a big, big
     </span>
     <span id="tr_227">
      problem. In addition, as I have kind of pointed out with some of these examples, a lot of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_228">
      these businesses are sort of overlapping. This great essay in the book that is coming out
     </span>
     <span id="tr_229">
      by Johnny Steinberg, South African journalist talking about the illicit abalone business
     </span>
     <span id="tr_230">
      in South Africa. Abalone is a large tasty snail, a sea snail. It turns out it is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_231">
      particularly considered a delicacy in south China. Unsure -- abalone furthermore, it is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_232">
      fairly tightly controlled -- it is easy to over fish abalone so it is fairly tightly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_233">
      controlled fisheries. In South Africa, it is controlled but not so much by the state. But
     </span>
     <span id="tr_234">
      rather than by Chinese gangsters who basically control the abalone trade between south
     </span>
     <span id="tr_235">
      Africa and (inaudible). What is really interesting about this is that it is not that the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_236">
      illicit abalone business but the way they pay for their abalone to the people who are
     </span>
     <span id="tr_237">
      harvesting the stuff in south Africa they pay them with crystal meth, which is produced
     </span>
     <span id="tr_238">
      in China. Then it fuels the huge drug problem in many of the townships and slums. That in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_239">
      a nutshell is what deviant globalization is all about. The main thing I want to leave you
     </span>
     <span id="tr_240">
      with for this part of the presentation is that deviant globalization is not marginal
     </span>
     <span id="tr_241">
      phenomenon, it is a huge phenomenon. And by all indications it is rapidly growing. I want
     </span>
     <span id="tr_242">
      to give you a couple of examples of some of the ways in which we know it is growing.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_243">
      These numbers also tell us a little bit about a nature of the trade. So let me talk about
     </span>
     <span id="tr_244">
      cocaine prices, this is kilo equivalent. In 1997 a kilo of cocaine in Peru cost about
     </span>
     <span id="tr_245">
      $650 that has dropped $250 a few years ago. These numbers by the way come from UN office
     </span>
     <span id="tr_246">
      for drug control. Then after it gets ships for processing to Columbia it costs about one
     </span>
     <span id="tr_247">
      thousand dollars. Then once it is imported into the United States, it costs about
     </span>
     <span id="tr_248">
      $15,000-- now, again, all these numbers are continually dropping over time -- once it is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_249">
      wholesaled, in the United States, it goes up again, to about $21,000 and finally at the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_250">
      retail, street price of kilo cocaine once broken up into gram size packages, it goes for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_251">
      about (inaudible). These are 2005 prices. You can see the numbers are generally declining
     </span>
     <span id="tr_252">
      over time. Now, most of you may not be economists but generally speaking with prices are
     </span>
     <span id="tr_253">
      declining and demand as we assume it probably is for a commodity like this, that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_254">
      generally means the supply is increasing. The other thing that I point out that is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_255">
      important to recognize, look at where the profit margin is highest. It is specifically at
     </span>
     <span id="tr_256">
      the stage of importation. Why is that? That is because that is where that is the most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_257">
      pressure on the supply chain from the narcotics regulators, the DEA. So the narcotic
     </span>
     <span id="tr_258">
      regulators they think they are in the drug eradication business, they are actually the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_259">
      drug regulation business. And by increasing the risk for the people who are importing the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_260">
      stuff in, they increase the ability of those who stay in the business to demand premium
     </span>
     <span id="tr_261">
      prices, and to actually raise the profit margins for the people who manage to survive in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_262">
      the business. So if you are able to control that part of the business by say corrupting a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_263">
      border agent and there's been 80 border agents in the last three years in the U.S. that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_264">
      have been convicted of corruption of one sort or another, then you can make 1400 percent
     </span>
     <span id="tr_265">
      profit margins. Some of you may not be business people but almost every business people
     </span>
     <span id="tr_266">
      in the world would kill for a business for a business with those kind of margins. In
     </span>
     <span id="tr_267">
      fact, these guys do. Another piece of data that is useful for getting a sense of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_268">
      growth of this is the growth of MALWARE. These are new malicious code signatures, and new
     </span>
     <span id="tr_269">
      variance of MALWARE in terms of thousands of cases, and you can see between 2003 and 2009
     </span>
     <span id="tr_270">
      there has been about 200 percent a year annual growth in the number of MALWARE cases.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_271">
      There is a lot of stuff that is going on with it. But a big part of this is where these
     </span>
     <span id="tr_272">
      MALWARE cases are originating from. Increasingly, they are originating from the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_273">
      south. That's directly correlated to the fact that Internet adoption is increasingly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_274">
      rapidly in the global south. If there is one thing that is almost an iron law, within 6
     </span>
     <span id="tr_275">
      to 18 months of a country getting a big fat broad band access, it is likely to emerge as
     </span>
     <span id="tr_276">
      a new hot bed of hacking. Now to paraphrase, Nicholas Negroponte who runs the media lab
     </span>
     <span id="tr_277">
      at MIT, or used to run the media lab at MIT, a lab top for every child means a as hacker
     </span>
     <span id="tr_278">
      in every hut. Now, I could proceed with some more examples, but I think you get the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_279">
      point. I tend to be pretty skeptical a lot of statistics that we hear about deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_280">
      globalization. Mainly because everybody who is involved in this has an incentive to lie
     </span>
     <span id="tr_281">
      about the size of the these things. These last two sets of statistics, cocaine pricing
     </span>
     <span id="tr_282">
      and MALWARE signatures, criminals have to come out in the open to do their business so
     </span>
     <span id="tr_283">
      you have some confidence that these numbers are pretty accurate. But a lot of the other
     </span>
     <span id="tr_284">
      numbers are probably not particularly reliable. On the one hand, the deviant industries,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_285">
      themselves, do everything they can to remain out of sight if the state authorities or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_286">
      anybody else is really trying to measure on a consistent basis what they are up to. On
     </span>
     <span id="tr_287">
      the other hand, most of the state organizations that are in charge, or supposed to be in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_288">
      the charge of paying attention to this stuff have a vested interest in both of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_289">
      exaggerating the scale of the phenomenon and in exaggerating the scale of their success
     </span>
     <span id="tr_290">
      against the phenomenon so all in all, there is not a lot of confidence in the statistics.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_291">
      Because deviant globalization takes place in the shadows of the global economy and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_292">
      outside of the purview of the state, generally speaking, the best way to try to get your
     </span>
     <span id="tr_293">
      head around this problem is to look at the ethnographic accounts. Some of this is done by
     </span>
     <span id="tr_294">
      journalism, by academics, sort academics, and if you see the book, it reflects that.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_295">
      There is a series of books that I read just in the last couple of years that have really
     </span>
     <span id="tr_296">
      illuminated this idea for me Gomorrah by the Italian writer Roberto Saviano which is also
     </span>
     <span id="tr_297">
      made into a great movie that I recommend if you haven't seen, about the way the mop has
     </span>
     <span id="tr_298">
      infiltrated every aspect of daily life in that part of Italy. Then the Snakehead by the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_299">
      Patrick Radden Keefe which is a brilliant account of the dynamics of illegal Chinese
     </span>
     <span id="tr_300">
      immigration. The New Yorker which is currently edited by David Rimnick who cut his teeth
     </span>
     <span id="tr_301">
      on this 20 years ago when he wrote a book on the class of the Soviet Union which was a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_302">
      hotbed of Stage 1 deviant globalization. He's been having a whole series of writers do
     </span>
     <span id="tr_303">
      really interesting stuff. One of the best pieces I read recently is by (inaudible) on the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_304">
      illegal timber trade in Siberia. And finally, I have to recommend Carolyn Nordstrom's
     </span>
     <span id="tr_305">
      book Global Outlaws which is an ethnographic account of what the war economy of Angola is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_306">
      like and how it actually works. It is a brilliant book. So these are the kind of sources
     </span>
     <span id="tr_307">
      that I have used to get my head around this stuff. In addition to doing a lot of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_308">
      interviews when people are participating in these kinds of activities. So. What makes
     </span>
     <span id="tr_309">
      deviant globalization possible? In a word, we do. You do. I do. The essence of deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_310">
      globalization is moral arbitrage. Let me unpack that. Emile Durkheim, a French
     </span>
     <span id="tr_311">
      sociologist, observed a long time ago, that societies are to a large extent defined and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_312">
      made up of and defined by their taboos. That is by what they prohibit either morally or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_313">
      in the case of modern societies, legally. But in the globalized world economy, the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_314">
      functional effect of taboos and prohibitions and not so much necessarily to readies
     </span>
     <span id="tr_315">
      demand, so much as it to reduce supply in particular locations which in turn creates
     </span>
     <span id="tr_316">
      market opportunities. Moreover, the prohibition or their effective enforcement varies
     </span>
     <span id="tr_317">
      tremendously from one locale to another, creating price gaps between different locations.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_318">
      Taking advantage of these kind of price differences for a given commodity between two
     </span>
     <span id="tr_319">
      different market places represents exactly what economists refer to as arbitrage
     </span>
     <span id="tr_320">
      opportunity, an opportunity to make a market between two places where the places aren't
     </span>
     <span id="tr_321">
      aligned. This is precisely what deviant entrepreneurs are doing with respect to deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_322">
      commodities. They are connecting suppliers in one lightly regulated or controlled market
     </span>
     <span id="tr_323">
      place to customers in a different more heavily controlled market place. Sometimes that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_324">
      means moving the commodities from -- closer to the consumers. Drugs or what have you.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_325">
      Other times that means moving the consumer closer to the product. Sex tourism, the organ
     </span>
     <span id="tr_326">
      trade and so on. State regulations, and here is the key point, state regulations which
     </span>
     <span id="tr_327">
      embody the moral inhibitions of the people they represent or at least some of the moral
     </span>
     <span id="tr_328">
      inhibitions of some of the people they represent, are the things that create the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_329">
      opportunities for the deviant entrepreneurs. Sex tourism only exists because people can't
     </span>
     <span id="tr_330">
      get that kind of sex at home. Drug dealing makes the highest profits precisely where
     </span>
     <span id="tr_331">
      people decide to -- where the regulators decide to put the most pressure. Or consider
     </span>
     <span id="tr_332">
      cigarettes and boos. There are huge black markets on cigarettes markets grow in very
     </span>
     <span id="tr_333">
      statistically measurable ways every time you increase the prices, the taxes on cigarettes
     </span>
     <span id="tr_334">
      and boos. There are huge businesses in eastern Europe, -- I mean, cigarettes in Europe
     </span>
     <span id="tr_335">
      costs 7, $8 a pack, they cost 40 cents to produce, so there is huge cigarettes smuggling
     </span>
     <span id="tr_336">
      businesses based mostly just outside the European union that basically supply between
     </span>
     <span id="tr_337">
      15-30 percent of the cigarettes to western Europe. Same thing is going on in the western
     </span>
     <span id="tr_338">
      hemisphere, cigarette smuggling is a hot bed, one of the key industries in the tri-border
     </span>
     <span id="tr_339">
      area between Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay in South America, and a lot of these
     </span>
     <span id="tr_340">
      cigarettes end up on the on the San Francisco. So here is a key point, it is our moral
     </span>
     <span id="tr_341">
      inhibitions, or our attempt to enforce them, inevitably enforce them unevenly that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_342">
      creates the opportunities for deviant entrepreneurs to make the money that they do. Now,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_343">
      I want to make a couple other points about the structure of this trade. Deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_344">
      globalization is not identical to illicit trade. What really defines deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_345">
      globalization is not so much whether it is legal or illegal, as what you might refer to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_346">
      as the yuck factor. Let me give you an example of that. A perfectly legal activity which
     </span>
     <span id="tr_347">
      definitely is deviant globalization. Until 2008, the age of consent in Canada was 14. It
     </span>
     <span id="tr_348">
      was only raised to 18 a couple of years ago when the story that I'm about to tell became
     </span>
     <span id="tr_349">
      a scandal in Canada. Turned out that 2005, 2006, 2007, there were all these men primarily
     </span>
     <span id="tr_350">
      in border states in the United States, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, who were using chat
     </span>
     <span id="tr_351">
      rooms to meet 15, 14 year old girls from Canada online and arrange it to where they will
     </span>
     <span id="tr_352">
      go meet them in hotels rooms in Toronto or Montreal or what have you in Canada. This was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_353">
      obviously a way of getting around the underage sex laws in the United States and it was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_354">
      perfectly legal, but also perfectly deviant. Same thing is going on right now, that has
     </span>
     <span id="tr_355">
      changed because they have changed the laws in Canada. But the same thing is going on
     </span>
     <span id="tr_356">
      right now in the heart of Europe. Right now the age of consent for paid sexual relations
     </span>
     <span id="tr_357">
      in Switzerland in 16. In Italy and France, it is 18, and in Germany, it is 21.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_358">
      Unsurprisingly, Switzerland, has emerged as basically, entropro for men who like sex with
     </span>
     <span id="tr_359">
      under age girls, or young girls I should say. Has become a magnet for it. This is all
     </span>
     <span id="tr_360">
      over the newspaper. This is all over the newspapers in France. Second thing I'd say,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_361">
      deviant globalization is not identical to the informal economy. We shouldn't confuse it
     </span>
     <span id="tr_362">
      with disorganization. Yes, it is run off the books and outside government oversite. Most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_363">
      deviant globalization enterprises, are anything but mom and pop shops. In fact, most of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_364">
      the participants in deviant globalization operate in large complex and carefully managed
     </span>
     <span id="tr_365">
      organizations run by roofless entrepreneurs whose basic business strategies would be
     </span>
     <span id="tr_366">
      familiar to any reader of the harbor business review. The big guys are constantly are
     </span>
     <span id="tr_367">
      trying to increase their market share, they try to be number 1 and number 2 in every
     </span>
     <span id="tr_368">
      market they enter why the little guy seek monopolies. They work out strategies for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_369">
      creating barriers to entry. They develop channel strategies so once they built the pipe
     </span>
     <span id="tr_370">
      for moving one kind of illicit commodity, why not pump all sorts of other illicit
     </span>
     <span id="tr_371">
      commodities so those gangsters who start out by being cigarette smugglers during the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_372">
      1990s then became sanction busters against the sanctions against Siberia now become the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_373">
      primary traffickers of women for sexual slavery in western Europe, taking poor women out
     </span>
     <span id="tr_374">
      of the poor villages in eastern Europe and Russia and bringing them across the borders in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_375">
      western Europe. Finally, they often leverage the information technology that, in 2
     </span>
     <span id="tr_376">
      million a Columbian drug lords house was raided, and they found in his basement a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_377">
      mainframe that was being used to run the complex spreadsheet and future forecasting for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_378">
      his entire business. I don't know where he got a consultant to run this thing, I guess,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_379">
      he wasn't the guy running it himself. But somehow managed to get this thing to run his
     </span>
     <span id="tr_380">
      very complex business. Now, I don't know want to exaggerate this, there is a lot of --
     </span>
     <span id="tr_381">
      lot of deviant businesses, not necessarily run with profit maximization as their focus.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_382">
      Political power, prestige, business stability, business continuity, these are often
     </span>
     <span id="tr_383">
      imperative things. But at the same time, the same exact thing is true of aboveboard
     </span>
     <span id="tr_384">
      businesses. The notion that all businesses are profit maximizing to the exclusion of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_385">
      everything else, is a completely. Everybody knows people make tradeoffs about work life
     </span>
     <span id="tr_386">
      balance. About what businesses they want to go into. These things are not just governed
     </span>
     <span id="tr_387">
      by profit motives but all other sorts of things. So, that in a nut shell is what deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_388">
      globalization is. What I'd like to do next, is talk a little bit what deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_389">
      globalization means. I have two propositions, each are meant as provocation. The first
     </span>
     <span id="tr_390">
      thing I'd like to say, deviant globalization is development. Let me start by reading you
     </span>
     <span id="tr_391">
      a quote by Milton Freedmen which I think is quite telling, he said, "The black market was
     </span>
     <span id="tr_392">
      a way of getting around government control, a way of enabling the free market to work, it
     </span>
     <span id="tr_393">
      was a way of opening up, enabling people." Now, I'll confess. That quoting him in this
     </span>
     <span id="tr_394">
      way, is a little bit shaky. But he is making a very important point for us. Which is that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_395">
      deviant globalization is not necessarily all bad news. If you like entrepreneurship,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_396">
      innovation, then you got to like deviant globalization. The guys who organize the markets
     </span>
     <span id="tr_397">
      of deviant globalization are in many case brilliant innovators. They are constantly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_398">
      building new businesses. They know how to thrive in the chaos of contemporary capitalism.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_399">
      All the clichs you read about, radical innovation, apply in spades to deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_400">
      globalization. Second, and just as important, deviant globalization represents an
     </span>
     <span id="tr_401">
      extremely significant flow of money and resources from the global north to the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_402">
      south. There is a large amount of resources that come this way. Almost certainly, several
     </span>
     <span id="tr_403">
      organizers of magnitude bigger than the foreign aid that flows in the global north and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_404">
      the global south. Almost certainly an order of magnitude bigger. This is a major way of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_405">
      bringing wealth from the global north to the global south. What these two ideas suggest
     </span>
     <span id="tr_406">
      is that in a peculiar way, deviant globalization is enabling precisely the sorts of grass
     </span>
     <span id="tr_407">
      roots empowerment and non-dependency that have been calling for the last 60 years in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_408">
      development. Let me give you another example to kind of frame this for you. There is an
     </span>
     <span id="tr_409">
      article in the Atlantic monthly that appeared in December, where he noted that the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_410">
      Mexican narcotics industry currently employs 400 thousand people. Directly, employs 400
     </span>
     <span id="tr_411">
      thousand people. That is more than finance industry, that is more than the oil industry.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_412">
      That is more than every single industry except for tourism, and agriculture. This is a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_413">
      major part of the Mexican economy. My colleague, who is the coeditor of the book, was in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_414">
      Mexico a couple of years ago, he noticed that everybody in the village had a brand-new
     </span>
     <span id="tr_415">
      house, a colored T.V., and a satellite dish. He was a little surprised by this. These
     </span>
     <span id="tr_416">
      seemed to be poor peasants, who were just farming corn and what not. He started asking
     </span>
     <span id="tr_417">
      some questions about where all this stuff came from. At first he got a lot of cold
     </span>
     <span id="tr_418">
      stares, not a lot of answers, finally, he was told to shut up and stop asking questions.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_419">
      This is a way that people can get rich, or at least stop being as poor as they were
     </span>
     <span id="tr_420">
      before. And this is also fully recognized by many of the states where this stuff is going
     </span>
     <span id="tr_421">
      on. There is a number of states that have embraced deviant globalization as an explicit
     </span>
     <span id="tr_422">
      development strategy for themselves. Probably the most obvious example is way the sex
     </span>
     <span id="tr_423">
      tourism has actively encouraged by a number of states in south East Asia. Thailand,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_424">
      basically, became a global place for sex in the 1960s when it basically offered to be the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_425">
      host for American soldiers on rest and recreation for the Vietnam war was also known as
     </span>
     <span id="tr_426">
      intercourse and intoxication. And, this helped start the Thailand economy. A lot of money
     </span>
     <span id="tr_427">
      came in. It was a significant source of revenue. And many countries that are neighboring
     </span>
     <span id="tr_428">
      Thailand are today emulating that same exact pattern, whether it is Cambodia, or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_429">
      Philippines, these guys see themselves -- encouraging or putting up with sex tourism as a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_430">
      way to jump start economic development. In some ways, this is not that different in kind
     </span>
     <span id="tr_431">
      from the way third world countries are happy to start a polluting factory in a way of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_432">
      attracting investment and jump starting growth. Just the same way, it is basically, a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_433">
      question of whether you want to accept physical pollution or a kind of social and moral
     </span>
     <span id="tr_434">
      pollution. So beyond the states in question, deviant globalization also represents the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_435">
      personal enrichment strategy for those who participate in the trade. I don't want to say
     </span>
     <span id="tr_436">
      coercion is not part of the equation, for those who participate in the trade. I don't
     </span>
     <span id="tr_437">
      want to say that coercion is not part of the equation in many cases, it is certainly is.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_438">
      But the majority of the cases, people who sale their organs or become a drug mules, or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_439">
      decide to have a few middle age foreigners, aren't doing it because they are forced but
     </span>
     <span id="tr_440">
      because it is the fastest, best, easiest way to make a dollar and it is better than
     </span>
     <span id="tr_441">
      staying back in the village. So from that perspective, deviant globalization can be seen
     </span>
     <span id="tr_442">
      as a survival strategy of the weak. To say this again is not to deny the awfulness of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_443">
      exploitation and the oppressiveness that in many cases deviant globalization represents,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_444">
      for the line workers within deviant enterprises but simply recognize it with rare
     </span>
     <span id="tr_445">
      exceptions. Most of the participates, child prostitutes aside, have some degree of agency
     </span>
     <span id="tr_446">
      in this. Becoming a wildlife smuggler or a drug runner, or an organ donor is a choice. It
     </span>
     <span id="tr_447">
      is not a very pleasant choice but are you go sure it is a worse choice than becoming a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_448">
      coal miner in China? Every week on average more people die coal mining in China than died
     </span>
     <span id="tr_449">
      in that mining accident in west Virginia last week. So let me step back now and talk a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_450">
      little bit about what the back story to deviant globalization is. This returns to the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_451">
      them I started with, my dissertation, which I then turned into a book. Which was about
     </span>
     <span id="tr_452">
      the failure of why that book referred to high modern development schemes. Getting into
     </span>
     <span id="tr_453">
      that is a topic for another day. But I have to provide a brief thumbnail in order to make
     </span>
     <span id="tr_454">
      this make sense here. High modernism refers to economic development as a process that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_455">
      government spear head-on behalf of their populations as a whole and that aims to create a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_456">
      broadly inclusive set of public goods around health security, education healthcare soon.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_457">
      From the point of view of the global south the Cold War was from one perspective a debate
     </span>
     <span id="tr_458">
      about whether communism or liberal capitalism offered better prospects for building
     </span>
     <span id="tr_459">
      precisely such prosperous, public goods providing welfare states. Now diverse economic
     </span>
     <span id="tr_460">
      strategies as we all know, were attempted, were tried in order to realize this dream.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_461">
      Collective ownership of the means of production in communism countries, laissez-faire,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_462">
      import substitution, industrialization, export led growth and diverse political programs
     </span>
     <span id="tr_463">
      went along with this. What almost all of these strategies have in common with a few
     </span>
     <span id="tr_464">
      exceptions in each Asia is that they failed. Communism failed most spectacularly but
     </span>
     <span id="tr_465">
      again for a few countries in the pacific realm, capitalism didn't do much better for most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_466">
      of those countries during most of this period. Not in terms of headline growth, not in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_467">
      terms of poverty reduction, not in most measures of human development that is measured by
     </span>
     <span id="tr_468">
      the united nations. When communism died in 1899 what died was not just the particular
     </span>

      collectivist economic system and authoritarian politics of the soviet union and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_470">
      satellites, cremated along with that corpse was the broadly public civic mind of notion
     </span>
     <span id="tr_471">
      of development as the central defining responsibility of the post colonial state. What
     </span>
     <span id="tr_472">
      arose in instead in the 1990s, was what can be known as the Washington consensus. Now the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_473">
      Washington consensus represented the dominant neoliberal economic program for the global

     </span>
     <span id="tr_475">
      Dani Roderick, is has defined it this way. He says, "stabilized, privatized, and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_476">
      liberalized, became the mantra of a generation of (inaudible) who cut thirtieth in the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_477">
      development world and of the political leaders they counseled." Wasn't hard to understand
     </span>
     <span id="tr_478">
      why this particular view of what the state should or shouldn't be doing made sense. It
     </span>
     <span id="tr_479">
      was not hard to point to the undeniable corruption, the inessentials, the rent seeking
     </span>
     <span id="tr_480">
      and predatory behavior of many post colonial states in the global south. And
     </span>
     <span id="tr_481">
      neoliberalism had a solution that definitely addressed those problems. It sought to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_482">
      dismantle these states by slashing public bureaucracies, foreign aid, trade barriers, and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_483">
      so on. Where such programs were successfully imposed, which includes, almost all of Latin
     </span>
     <span id="tr_484">
      America, much of south Asia, much of Africa, it led to what might in a nutshell may be
     </span>
     <span id="tr_485">
      called the hollowing out of the state. What I mean by hollowing out you still have in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_486">
      these places, the physical and institutional infrastructure of a state. You still have
     </span>
     <span id="tr_487">
      the capital building, you still have representatives that go to the European union, you
     </span>
     <span id="tr_488">
      still have a constitution that this that and the next thing is supposed to go on. But the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_489">
      actual capacity of those states to deliver anything like what they had been saying to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_490">
      their people they were supposed to be delivering, whether they were delivering a not is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_491">
      another story. The actual capacity to deliver those things really went away in a way that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_492">
      was a real signal difference from the way things were being run from the 1950s into the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_493">
      1980s in most of these states. And the post Cold War hollowing out of these states had
     </span>
     <span id="tr_494">
      two really critical results both of which are -- you can't understand why people in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_495">
      globalization have without understanding these two results. The first one is the deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_496">
      globalization signal unmistakably, to the individuals in this country that you are on
     </span>
     <span id="tr_497">
      your own. The end of the promise of the state building and building states to provide
     </span>
     <span id="tr_498">
      public goods or rather perhaps more accurately the revolution that those promises had
     </span>
     <span id="tr_499">
      always been empty, meant that people had to strike out on their own. The result was a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_500">
      global unleashing of what we might call survival entrepreneurship. Throughout the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_501">
      south and above the all the formal communism states which previously lacked any legal
     </span>
     <span id="tr_502">
      outlets for that kind of behavior. Here it is again, I mentioned David Remnick cutting
     </span>
     <span id="tr_503">
      his teeth on the history of the way the Soviet Union and the economic system is going on
     </span>
     <span id="tr_504">
      there. There is a reason why Eastern Europe emerged as a real hot bed of epicenter of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_505">
      deviant globalization in the 1990s, and that is because the only people who had
     </span>
     <span id="tr_506">
      entrepreneurial skills in the late 1980s who were able to develop them in the Communism
     </span>
     <span id="tr_507">
      regime were people who were illicitly doing things that were illegal. You had to already
     </span>
     <span id="tr_508">
      be a A-moral person in order to develop the kind of entrepreneurial skills that would be
     </span>
     <span id="tr_509">
      absolutely required in the post-shock therapy, post-neoliberal, post-Washington
     </span>
     <span id="tr_510">
      consensus, versions of the states that were going to operate in. So it was absolutely
     </span>
     <span id="tr_511">
      inevitable, read rim nicks book from 1991, he spells it out. It is absolutely inevitable
     </span>
     <span id="tr_512">
      that the people who are going to take over the economies in these places are people who
     </span>
     <span id="tr_513">
      are criminals. That's at the elite level. At the grassroots level people had the same
     </span>
     <span id="tr_514">
      kind of choices to make the economies were collapsing, people did what they had to do to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_515">
      survive. If that meant becoming sex workers, or organ sellers or narcotic dealers or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_516">
      wildlife smugglers, they did that. This is what they had to do to survive, so they did.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_517">
      The second and equally important impact of the hollowing out of states at the end of a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_518">
      Cold War, was that it largely dismantled the regulatory capacity of states in the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_519">
      south. In other words, tossed out, with the (inaudible) was much of the practical
     </span>
     <span id="tr_520">
      capacity to enforce any kind of border control or other kinds of legal regimes, this too
     </span>
     <span id="tr_521">
      librated the force of globalization obviously. It basically turned the global south into
     </span>
     <span id="tr_522">
      a smugglers paradise. This borderless world of the global south was in many ways is a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_523">
      return to the premodern order of fragmented sovereignties, judicial ambiguities,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_524">
      jurisdiction ambiguities, localized governance. There's still a state that is sitting
     </span>
     <span id="tr_525">
      there, but those guys, in many cases are not people who are running anything that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_526">
      actually matters on the ground in most places in the global south. So what does all this
     </span>
     <span id="tr_527">
      add up to? From one perspective deviant globalization, can be seen as the failure of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_528">
      modernization and development. From another perspective, it can be seen not as a failure
     </span>
     <span id="tr_529">
      of development but rather as actually existing development. I use that phrase carefully,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_530">
      some of you may remember is meant to be an ironic echo of the old soviet phrase that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_531">
      Soviet Union represented actually existing socialism. This was meant as a putdown to all
     </span>
     <span id="tr_532">
      those western socialists who said no that is the perverted version of socialism, that is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_533">
      not real socialism. We have a different vision of it. The soviets said no, no, no. We
     </span>
     <span id="tr_534">
      have actual existing socialism, don't listen to what all those soft-head liberals in the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_535">
      west who think their socialists, actually know what socialism mean. So likewise, equating
     </span>
     <span id="tr_536">
      deviant globalization with actual existing development is meant as an invitation to judge
     </span>
     <span id="tr_537">
      development not by the vision statements but forth by the world bank or the IMF or the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_538">
      Gates Foundation, but rather by its actual results. Just actually existing socialism
     </span>
     <span id="tr_539">
      represents a perverse realization of socialisms promise of equality so deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_540">
      globalization represents the kind of perverse realization of capitalism of personal
     </span>
     <span id="tr_541">
      liberty. To the same extent that Soviet oppression represented, and told us something
     </span>
     <span id="tr_542">
      very fundamental and very disturbing about the dream of socialism, deviant globalization
     </span>
     <span id="tr_543">
      tells us something very fundamental and very disturbing about the dream of capitalism.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_544">
      Simply put deviant globalization is what you get when you combine massive socioeconomic
     </span>
     <span id="tr_545">
      inequality, moral lumpiness across global landscape and the technologies of globalization
     </span>
     <span id="tr_546">
      that bring all that together. What that enables of the rapid of movement of people in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_547">
      goods. None of these elements are likely to be reversed over time barring some really
     </span>
     <span id="tr_548">
      unexpected exhaustion of shock. So I would summarize by saying deviant globalization is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_549">
      not a correctable operation. It is not some perception to the rule of globalization. It
     </span>
     <span id="tr_550">
      is not a marginal feature of the system. It is the system. Second major proposition I'd
     </span>
     <span id="tr_551">
      like to make about why deviant globalization matters, is deviant globalization is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_552">
      creating a new class of political actors Whose geopolitical importance is only likely to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_553">
      grow with the underline resource streams that they are in control of. Just like the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_554">
      classic high modern state that I was talking about earlier, was supposed to create a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_555">
      certain class of actors namely a welfare public goods providing state, deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_556">
      globalization is creating a different class of geopolitical actors. What my friend John
     </span>
     <span id="tr_557">
      Rob refers to in his blog as "global gorillas." In what sense would people like the

     <span id="tr_558">
      people in this picture by the way these are gorillas, men movement from the emancipation

     <span id="tr_559">
      of the Nigerian Delta, they steal oil basically -- they take the oil that is being pumped
     </span>
     <span id="tr_560">

     </span>
     <span id="tr_561">
      if those companies won't pay them more money and so on. In what sense are these guys
     </span>
     <span id="tr_562">
      political actors? Well, as we have seen, deviant entrepreneurs are controlling large and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_563">
      growing swats of the global economy. And they have this control basically outside of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_564">
      purview of the state. States have estimates how big they are, but have no control over
     </span>
     <span id="tr_565">
      it, no ability, they can sort of shape the flows but they can't really dictate the size,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_566">
      or dictate exactly who are going to be running these things. There's no sort of very
     </span>
     <span id="tr_567">
      efficient regulatory for deviant globalization. These actors also because they work in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_568">
      extra legal market places, will the non-insignificant quota of violence and force. That
     </span>
     <span id="tr_569">
      is sort of an occupational hazard if you are going to run extra legal business. You have
     </span>
     <span id="tr_570">
      to be able to adjudicate contracts and courts aren't going to help you there. And finally
     </span>
     <span id="tr_571">
      these deviant entrepreneurs, and this is what is really interesting, many of these
     </span>
     <span id="tr_572">
      deviant entrepreneurs are beginning to provide privatized versions of the same kinds of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_573">
      political goods that states used to say they were in the business of providing. Let me
     </span>
     <span id="tr_574">
      explain what that means. These private actors are beginning to provide things like health
     </span>
     <span id="tr_575">
      clinics, infrastructure, personal security justice of a rough sort, to the local
     </span>
     <span id="tr_576">
      communities in which they operate. They build parks. They build medical clinics. They
     </span>
     <span id="tr_577">
      sometimes even build schools. Now these are not things that are open to the public. They
     </span>
     <span id="tr_578">
      are open to their particular constituents, the children of the people who run their
     </span>
     <span id="tr_579">
      businesses. These are all company towns if you will. No such thing as public goods for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_580">
      these guys. But, they are providing the kinds of goods that create political loyalties in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_581">
      the consumers of these goods so if you are getting your clinic and your road, and your
     </span>
     <span id="tr_582">
      job from guys like this, are you going to be more loyal to these guys, or to the robber
     </span>
     <span id="tr_583">
      barons. It is pretty clear, where your loyalties are going to lie. The thing I want to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_584">
      emphasize these guys are not nice people, generally speaking. It is important to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_585">
      recognize, that these guys, these political entrepreneurs, are both the cause and an

      But they are resolutely not revolutionary actors. Revolutionary actors sought to capture
     </span>
     <span id="tr_588">
      the state, they wanted to control the state because they wanted to deliver those kinds of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_589">
      goods and services to their constituents. They had a very different kind of agenda. These
     </span>
     <span id="tr_590">
      guys, people like these two, this big drug dealer in Columbia, the arm and the arms
     </span>
     <span id="tr_591">
      dealer I referred to earlier, the guy on the right, these are much more typical of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_592">
      sort of counter actors that deviant globalization produces. What they don't want to do,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_593">
      they don't want to state over the state. It doesn't have very good functions. You have to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_594">
      attend boring meetings in Washington and New York. And then you also have to provide
     </span>
     <span id="tr_595">
      services to people you don't care about. They would much rather provide services to the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_596">
      people who are a part of their communities as they define them. Here I'm thinking of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_597">
      groups like the Modi army in Baghdad or the first command of the capital which is a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_598">
      prison gang in Brazil or the drug cartels in Mexico. These guys are all challenging the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_599">
      state de facto but except when they all directly challenged by the state, they don't go
     </span>
     <span id="tr_600">
      over the state. They do sometimes get in direct conflicts with the state, but usual only
     </span>
     <span id="tr_601">
      when the state initiates the conflicts. A couple of years ago, the first command of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_602">
      capital shut down South Palo for three days, cartel shut it down by staging attacks on
     </span>
     <span id="tr_603">
      the police stations. The reason they did that because the government decided they were
     </span>
     <span id="tr_604">
      going to try to break up the communications network that the drug kingpins were all in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_605">
      the jail were putting together. These guys ordered a hit taking out on the state for
     </span>
     <span id="tr_606">
      three days. South Palo State was shut down. South Palo State, should be noted has a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_607">
      quarter of all the industrial production of South America. So they basically shut down a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_608">
      quarter of South America for three days. This was because the state initiated the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_609">
      conflict. Likewise the bloodbath that is eternally taking place in the northerner Mexico
     </span>
     <span id="tr_610">
      is a direct result of the new president coming in late 2006 and saying stop. There was a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_611">
      lot of violence going on between the drug gangs competing over turf, but there wasn't a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_612">
      lot of violence directed citizens. The reason why things like what happened in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_613">
      (inaudible) where a party full of teenagers were just machined gunned for no reason is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_614">
      that these gangsters were trying to tell the government, if you keep messing with us, we
     </span>
     <span id="tr_615">
      are going to start taking it out on your constituents. It is only in these contexts that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_616">
      these guys usually directly confront the state. They prefer to sort of undermined the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_617">
      state, make the state be weak to carve out zones of autonomy for themselves so they can
     </span>
     <span id="tr_618">
      run their businesses, make their money. And they are not generally interested in directly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_619">
      under minding the state but de facto they end up functionally zapping the capacity, the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_620">
      legitimacy of the state because they are replacing the state de facto and functionally.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_621">
      This is a picture from South Palo by the way. You'll notice by the way, that big pool
     </span>
     <span id="tr_622">
      with swimming lanes, these guys each need to have their own pool on their balconies.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_623">
      These guys are All right though. What I'd like to conclude with is some thoughts about
     </span>
     <span id="tr_624">
      what all this tells us about the future of the world's economic system, the world
     </span>
     <span id="tr_625">
      political system. I think deviant globalization has basically two really interesting
     </span>
     <span id="tr_626">
      things to tell us about that. It contradicts the two most dominate narratives about the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_627">
      global south that have predominated in American foreign policy thinking, in public
     </span>
     <span id="tr_628">
      discourse over the last 15-20 years the first one of those discourses are the kind of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_629">
      liberal view put forth by people like Tom Freedmen, back in the 1990s for instance,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_630">
      Francis Fukuyama said that we were headed for that modest's vision of liberal states. He
     </span>
     <span id="tr_631">
      said we are going to have economic growth, the world is going to become flat, everybody
     </span>
     <span id="tr_632">
      is going to get rich, it is going to be great. We are going to end up with this world,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_633">
      this vision of perpetual peace. Sort of liberal dream of what international relations can
     </span>
     <span id="tr_634">
      become is one dominant narrative. It is pretty obvious, the ways in which deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_635">
      globalization challenges that particular narrative. Rather than creating a flat world of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_636">
      what we have seen as entrepreneurs are actually interested in creating a lumpy world that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_637">
      they can then turn into huge profits for themselves. Deviant globalization is not
     </span>
     <span id="tr_638">
      creating -- globalization in generally therefore deviant globalization is not creating a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_639">
      flat world but rather creating a world with huge disparities where there are actors that
     </span>
     <span id="tr_640">
      are perfectly happy with that state of affairs and are perfectly happy to challenge the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_641">
      states in (inaudible) ways rather than directly. States are withering away, hollowing out
     </span>
     <span id="tr_642">
      in the global south. But the notion that these guys are going to be coequal partners in
     </span>
     <span id="tr_643">
      some international comedy of high capacity liberal states all of which are equally
     </span>
     <span id="tr_644">
      functional is something like a bad joke. So that is probably pretty obvious way in which
     </span>
     <span id="tr_645">
      any knowledge contradicts one kind of conventional wisdom about the global south. But
     </span>
     <span id="tr_646">
      what I think is more interesting actually is the way that deviant globalization
     </span>
     <span id="tr_647">
      contradicts a different narrative about the global south. That is a much more dystopian
     </span>
     <span id="tr_648">
      narrative that has been put forth by a number of people. This usually goes-- the person
     </span>
     <span id="tr_649">
      that really kicked off this rhetoric back in the 1990s was the journalist Robert Kaplan
     </span>
     <span id="tr_650">
      in an essay that appeared in the Atlantic called the Coming Anarchy. He basically
     </span>
     <span id="tr_651">
      depicted a world, a future where there were two world. The zone of order, the global
     </span>
     <span id="tr_652">
      north where things were going to be great. Cold War was over, we weren't going to have to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_653">
      worry about the bomb coming down on our head, and we were all going to get rich and have
     </span>
     <span id="tr_654">
      lots of trade. But then the other world. The zone of anarchy, which of course, most of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_655">
      the world. Here was a situation of failed and collapsing states, of horrible new diseases
     </span>
     <span id="tr_656">
      of terrorists, of new wars of genocides; and much of the 1990s, Kaplan looked like a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_657">
      visionary. People saw what happened in the Balkings, people saw what happened in Rwanda,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_658">
      and the culmination Kaplan's vision seemed to take place on September 11, 2001 when
     </span>
     <span id="tr_659">
      terrorists sitting in one of these zoned of anarchy type places in Afghanistan managed to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_660">
      address plan and launch an attack which killed 3,000 people in Washington and New York
     </span>
     <span id="tr_661">
      city. But I think deviant globalization has something important to challenge in this
     </span>
     <span id="tr_662">
      vision. This might seem surprising. The point about deviant globalization, that this is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_663">
      not about disorder. It is actually very much an orderly process that deviant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_664">
      globalization creates. It is just not a liberal order that it is creating. It is a
     </span>
     <span id="tr_665">
      creating a illiberal order. These are places from the point of view from Washington or
     </span>
     <span id="tr_666">
      London look like ungoverned zones, are in fact, usually very governed, just not governed
     </span>
     <span id="tr_667">
      by states or the kinds of people that we like. They are governed by people who have
     </span>
     <span id="tr_668">
      narrow minded interests, they don't have the notion of the public, they have traditional
     </span>
     <span id="tr_669">
      values, but are really backward, horrible prejudices of one sort or another. These are
     </span>
     <span id="tr_670">
      people who are providing order for their communities. And I was having conversation with
     </span>
     <span id="tr_671">
      Stewart before this talk about Somalia, northern Somalia, is in many ways one of the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_672">
      better off places in Africa. They have the thriving business, piracy. They have a very
     </span>
     <span id="tr_673">
      good infrastructure system, a very dense cell phone network, probably better than the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_674">
      coverage we get one on one. We get people who provide order and justice. It is not very
     </span>
     <span id="tr_675">
      pleasant if you are a woman, and not very pleasant if you are adulter, not very pleasant
     </span>
     <span id="tr_676">
      if you don't want to worship Mohammed, but those things aside there's a certain order
     </span>
     <span id="tr_677">
      there for sure. And it is wrong to think as these places as a zone of anarchy or a failed
     </span>
     <span id="tr_678">
      state. These are not failed states. Failed states, the concept of a failed state falsely
     </span>
     <span id="tr_679">
      implies the normative order that everybody in the world wants to aspire to is a liberal
     </span>
     <span id="tr_680">
      state like something like the dominant model that most western states have striven after
     </span>
     <span id="tr_681">
      for the last 350 years. That is not what these guys want, and they are providing a very
     </span>
     <span id="tr_682">
      different kind of order. And they are learning to live in a world outside liberal states.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_683">
      So finally, what can we do about all this? I think, again, there might be a couple of
     </span>
     <span id="tr_684">
      choices that we often hear. One option that we sometimes hear is that we simply need to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_685">
      shut globalization down. This stuff is horrible. What we need to do, we need to end
     </span>
     <span id="tr_686">
      globalization. Go back to autonomists nation states. They call for capitalism to be
     </span>
     <span id="tr_687">
      restrained. And in essence for the plan to return to the long lost ideal of unitarian
     </span>
     <span id="tr_688">
      homogamous nation states. Several things to be said about this. First of all, I actually
     </span>
     <span id="tr_689">
      give globalization. I like traveling, I like the things it brings me cultural,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_690">
      economically, and so on; but aside from my personal preferences, this is not going to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_691">
      work. Why isn't it going to work? What did we just learn about deviant globalization?
     </span>
     <span id="tr_692">
      Deviant globalization, deviant entrepreneurs love it when people put up trade barriers.
     </span>
     <span id="tr_693">
      That is how they make a profit. The more people try to pull back from globalization, the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_694">
      more this is going to create -- for exactly the deviant entrepreneurs to be the only
     </span>
     <span id="tr_695">
      people who are benefiting from globalization. I think a very telling example is North
     </span>
     <span id="tr_696">
      Korea. We think of North Korea as the ultimate hermit kingdom, the closed society. And it
     </span>
     <span id="tr_697">
      is those things. Does that mean globalization has no impact on north Korea? Well people
     </span>
     <span id="tr_698">
      don't have cell phones. They have famines every 10 years or so. They have don't get
     </span>
     <span id="tr_699">
      quality T.V. like we do. But they do have some aspects of globalization. For example,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_700">
      they are the number one producer globally of counterfeit dollar bills. Also, currently
     </span>
     <span id="tr_701">
      supposed to be the number one source of black market nuclear technology. They are also
     </span>
     <span id="tr_702">
      major producer and exporter of opium and heroin. So in other words, when you try to close
     </span>
     <span id="tr_703">
      yourself off the only kind of globalization that you get is the deviant kind. I don't
     </span>
     <span id="tr_704">
      think this is going to work. I don't think it is a realistic option. I actually think
     </span>
     <span id="tr_705">
      that trying to pull back is going to make the problem worse rather than better. So the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_706">
      other sort of extreme, people sometimes propose when they hear this kind of lecture. Is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_707">
      well, we should just legalize it. Get rid of all these barriers. These are just silly
     </span>
     <span id="tr_708">
      moralisms, we should just give up the ghost, and let everything be permissible and get
     </span>
     <span id="tr_709">
      rid of this. I have to say, I have somewhat more sympathy with this kind of view because
     </span>
     <span id="tr_710">
      at least realistic about the economic incentives that under pit the system. But I also
     </span>
     <span id="tr_711">
      think is unrealistic, just as unrealistic as the first one is about economics, this is
     </span>
     <span id="tr_712">
      unrealistic about the nature of people's social systems. As I quoted him earlier,
     </span>
     <span id="tr_713">
      societies are defined in large measure by the set of things they prohibit. I think most
     </span>
     <span id="tr_714">
      of us, maybe we say, okay, we think marijuana should be legalized, more may be even
     </span>
     <span id="tr_715">
      cocaine and heroin, and do you really most of us think that parents should be allowed to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_716">
      sell their children to sex slaves? Or that northerners should be allowed to dump their
     </span>
     <span id="tr_717">
      toxic waste all over the global south? Or that countries should be allowed to completely
     </span>
     <span id="tr_718">
      rape their natural environments just because they happened to have some U.N. border drawn
     </span>
     <span id="tr_719">
      around this particular plot of land? I think most of us think there has to be limits. And
     </span>
     <span id="tr_720">
      there always will be in any event, even if you as an individual completely given up all
     </span>
     <span id="tr_721">
      moral limits. So I don't think that is a particularly realistic option. I think, the only
     </span>
     <span id="tr_722">
      thing we can do, is two things. We can make judicious choices. The first thing we have to
     </span>
     <span id="tr_723">
      do actually, is we have to recognize the structural nature of this phenomenon. And not
     </span>
     <span id="tr_724">
      try to run away from it. Not try to think it is going to away. We have to embrace the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_725">
      fact that this is the realty of the system. Once we do that, this forces us into a series
     </span>
     <span id="tr_726">
      of not very pleasant, but at least clear choices. We have to decide what do we worry
     </span>
     <span id="tr_727">
      about more? A million people in jail for nonviolent drug offenses? Or our moral the
     </span>
     <span id="tr_728">
      inhibitions about drug use? A blood northern Mexico or moral inhibition about drug use?
     </span>
     <span id="tr_729">
      Our desire to see countries in the global south be able to develop any way they want and
     </span>
     <span id="tr_730">
      dumping of toxic chemicals by northern countries and allowing them to do anyway they
     </span>
     <span id="tr_731">
      want. These are not easy choices, actually. I don't want -- I think most of us fall one
     </span>
     <span id="tr_732">
      way or the other, on these things. These are not easy choices. The main point I would
     </span>
     <span id="tr_733">
      leave us with, at the end of this, what deviant globalization tells is that these not
     </span>
     <span id="tr_734">
      easy choices are not going away. We are going to have to confront them and stick with the
