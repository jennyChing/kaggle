        Freddy's 10 best 
      Kills
       </a>
      </strong>
      , I immediately started receiving requests to do a follow-up 
      article all about another ultimate horror baddie. I'm of course speaking of
      <strong>
       Jason 
      Voorhees
      </strong>
      from the Friday the 13th films. While I'm admittedly a bigger 
      fan of Freddy Krueger, I still love Jason and his murderific ways. While 
      Freddy kills with creativity and charisma, Mr. Voorhees kills with a 
      silent brutality that is perhaps only rivaled by Michael Myers. He's the 
      big lug that you always enjoy watching as he decimates any teenagers who 
      dare to do drugs, engage in premarital sex, or just happen to be hanging 
      around Camp Crystal Lake. Hey, he's not picky about who he kills, and his 
      body count shows it. That's something any horror fan can appreciate.
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Keeping that in 
      mind, I'm happy to present you with my tribute to Jason Voorhees, the biggest, baddest horror icon ever to draw attention to the sport of hockey. 
      So grab 
      your machete because it's time to check out what are, in my opinion, his 10 best 
      kills.

      This 
      Hitchiker headed for Canada (and Love) is down on her luck. She's been getting turned 
      down for a ride so much that she actually has a backing to her hitchhiking 
      sign which reads "
      <strong>
       Fuck You!
      </strong>
      " - used for anybody who laughs as they 
      drive past her. Oh well, at least she can enjoy the tranquility of the 
      woods while she eats her banana. The tasty banana. The friendly banana. The happy banana. 
      The...  wait... what's that noise?

      Er, yeah, 
      about that banana. I doubt it tastes quite as good when your throat is 
      being pierced with a knife. Gotta love the close-up shot of the banana 
      being squeezed out as she twitches to death. A knife through the throat, 
      puking up blood and banana bits... that's enough to scare the balanced 
      fruit bowl right off of Miss Chiquita's head.

      After a romp 
      in the back of an RV, these two happy-go-lucky teenagers (Cort and Nikki) 
      start driving down the road. Unfortunately for them, they don't realize 
      that there's a stowaway on board. Cort has apparently never driven an RV 
      before and is having way too much fun in doing so. He cranks up the radio 
      and looks about as giddy as a kid on a go-kart driving the thing. Well, 
      while he has the radio cranked, he doesn't realize that his girl Nikki has 
      just been dragged into the bathroom by Jason. She struggles for a little 
      while, but she just had sex - clearly, she's screwed. (no pun intended)
     </p>
     <p align="center">
      <img alt="Nikki, you left me with quite an impression" border="0" height="226" src="kill2b.gif" width="400"/>
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Jason grabs 
      a hold of Nikki's head and rams her face right through the mirror and into 
      the wall. Her face gets crushed up against the wall with such brute force 
      that it leaves a perfect impression of it on the other side. Her last 
      moment in terror immortalized on the wall of an RV. That'll make a great 
      souvenir for one lucky camper.

     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Jason then 
      quickly dispatches Cort with a hunting knife to the face, which causes the 
      RV to lose control, flip over and burst into flames. Some would say he 
      died because he had sex too. I say he died because his name was "Cort".

     <p align="left">
      Well, that 
      is at least until he gets a machete to his face. Yeah, I think that might 
      put a dent in his plans. As if getting a machete to the face isn't bad 
      enough, he happens to be near a huge flight of stairs. Can you see where 
      I'm going with this?
     </p>
     <p align="center">
      <img alt="DOH! DOH! DOH! DOH! DOH!" border="0" height="227" src="kill3c.gif" width="400"/>
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      The force of 
      the machete strike causes his chair to roll backwards towards the flight 
      of stairs that just happens to be there. This sends his convulsing body 
      crashing down the stairs on the wheelchair. What's impressive is that the 
      wheelchair somehow doesn't flip over the entire way down, so I guess he 
      got lucky. Oh wait, no, he just got a machete to the face... he's not very 
      lucky at all.

       Crispin 
      Hellion Glover
      </strong>
      has been and always will be one of my favorite actors. 
      The guy just knows how to play "crazy" better than anybody else. That's 
      probably because he actually
      <em>
       is
      </em>
      crazy, but whatever the case, he's 
      damned entertaining to watch. What's great about his role in Friday the 
      13th Part IV is that he's actually playing a relatively normal guy. Sure, 
      his character is timid and isn't all that good with the ladies, but other 
      than that he's fairly normal. The funny thing is that no matter how hard 
      he tries, Crispin can't make a normal character seem normal. Nothing 
      demonstrates this better than when he asks a girl to dance and then busts 
      out some improvised moves of his own.

      Glover just 
      completely spazzes out to the music with no rhythm or coordination and 
      instead looks like a patient in the middle of his electroshock therapy 
      treatment. It's seriously one of the greatest dancing moments you'll ever 
      see on the screen. I'd say it ranks right up there with the
      <strong>
       <a href="http://www.i-mockery.com/blabber/?p=9" target="_blank">
        Carlton 
      Dance

      in my book. It's just that good. But no animated gif and 
      demonstrate the mastery of that dance, you must
      <strong>
       <a href="crispin-glover-dance.php" target="_blank">
        watch the video
       </a>
      </strong>
      . 
      Believe it or not, even with that dance, he still manages to get laid shortly 
      after.
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Well all 
      good things must come to an end, even for seizure dancers like Crispin. He 
      goes into the kitchen to look for the corkscrew and can't find it 
      anywhere. Don't worry there Crispin, Jason is more than willing to lend 
      you a hand.

     <p align="left">
      Jason stabs 
      him in the hand with the corkscrew so hard that he's actually pinned to 
      the countertop. And then it's time for a meat cleaver to the face. I gotta 
      say though; 
      I still think Crispin was less twitchy in this death scene than he was in 
      his freestyle dance.

      Rick just

      Jason grabs 
      Rick from behind, lifts him up into the air and begins to crush his head 
      with his bare hands. He squeezes Rick's head so tightly that one of his 
      eyeballs bursts right out at the screen. I was actually lucky enough to 
      see this movie on the big screen with 3D glasses 'n all and the crowd was 
      in hysterics throughout most of the movie. There's just so much blatant 
      moments that were clearly filmed just for use of the 3D technology at the 
      time. Watching one of the guys use a yo-yo in 3D had the entire crowd 
      going "
      <em>
       whoaaaahhh!
      </em>
      " all sarcastically, but nothing topped the eye 
      popping scene. Seeing that fake eyeball come right at you in 3D is nothing 
      short of hilarious. Sadly, the Friday the 13th box set doesn't come with 
      the movie enabled for 3D viewing, unlike the Elm Street Box Set where you 
      can watch the cheesy 3D scenes in part 6. Maybe someday we'll get to see 
      "Friday the 13th Part 3" restored in all its 3D glory. One can only 
      hope...

      people didn't like the 9th installment of the Friday the 13th series 
      because Jason wasn't in it enough. Well he was in it the whole time 
      really, but he was basically possessing people left 'n right and you'd 
      only see him in the reflection of a mirror. All that aside, there was 
      plenty of gore in the movie and it also had that ending where you see 
      Freddy's glove pull Jason's hockey mask underground - which of course 
      really got horror fans talking in a frenzy about a possible Freddy vs. 
      Jason film.

      There was 
      also something from this film that I've been promising myself to do for a 
      long time, but I have yet to do so. I wanted to make a

      </strong>
      for myself just like they did in the restaurant. Guess I need to get a 
      barbeque grill sometime and make that magic happen.
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Well anyway, 
      on with the kill since that's what you're here for...

      Deborah is 
      having a dandy ol' time with her boyfriend at the camp site when they 
      decide to go inside the tent for some of that infamous premarital sex. She 
      even agrees not to use a condom this time so you know she'll be paying
      <strong>
       big-time

      for such carelessness.

      Everything's 
      going fine and dandy for the two of them until Jason shows up with a 
      barbed wire spike. He thrusts it into the tent, and it bursts straight 
      through her chest. Think that's gonna ruin the moment between Deborah and 
      her man? I dunno, maybe they can still rekindle the magic. Oh wait, what's 
      that you say? Jason's not done. Oh...

      Mr. 
      Voorhees, or "The Love Doctor" as I like to call him, yanks the spike 
      straight upward, effectively ripping Deborah's body in half while her 
      boyfriend screams his ass off and gets covered in blood. Sorry fella, it 
      just wasn't meant to be. By the way, I hope you appreciate how I took the 
      time to cover her

      the youth of the world see all the blood 'n gore they want... but god 
      forbid they see a nipple. WHAT WOULD JEBUS THINK!?

      Jason has 
      followed a group of people all the way from Camp Crystal Lake to Manhattan 
      just so he can kill them. Julius here tries to make a phone call but Jason 
      damn near chokes him to death in the phone booth. Luckily for Julius, he's 
      a quick young scrapper and makes his way up onto the roof of a nearby 
      building. Jason follows him up there, and when Julius realizes that 
      there's nowhere left to run, he decides to fight Jason.
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      What's funny 
      is that Jason seems to be in an extremely generous mood at the moment, 
      because he actually let's Julius try his hardest to knock him out. Julius 
      punches away at Jason as hard as he can - directly on his hockey mask most 
      of the time, a brilliant move on Julius' behalf. When his hands are 
      bloodied and he's completely exhausted, Julius tells Jason to give him his 
      best shot. Now what kind of gentleman would Jason be not to oblige his 
      request?

      With one 
      mighty punch, Jason knocks Julius' head clean off. It spins in the air for 
      a bit, rolls down the edge of the building and then lands in a dumpster. 
      Three points!

      Trey is a

      (from "Jason X")
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Jason X 
      definitely has its fair share of flaws. First off, they took Jason into 
      outer space, which is generally considered to be a killing blow to any 
      horror movie series. Next, they turned him into a killer cyborg later on - 
      and I don't think he's ever looked worse. Still, even with all the bad 
      things about this movie, there were some really fun kill scenes such as 
      this one...
     </p>
     <p align="center">
      <img alt="IN THE FUTURE, ALL SCIENTIST LADIES ARE SCANTILY CLAD BLONDES" border="0" height="221" src="kill9a.jpg" width="400"/>
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      After being 
      recovered by an explorer team roughly four centuries into the future, 
      Jason's body is thawing out on a table in the lab room. Hmm, four 
      centuries, eh? Do you think Jason's gonna be a bit cranky after such a 
      long nap? Yeah, I do too.
     </p>
     <p align="center">
      <img alt="TIME FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP!" border="0" height="221" src="kill9b.gif" width="400"/>
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      He grabs the 
      scientist lady, Adrienne, and forces her face into a nearby vat of liquid 
      nitrogen. From here we get a great submerged shot of her face freezing in 
      an instant. But again, I said Jason was probably gonna be cranky, so 
      freezing her face probably isn't gonna be enough to satisfy the big 
      galoot. So he does what any cranky, homicidal maniac who had been asleep 
      for the past four-hundred years would do...
     </p>
     <p align="center">
      <img alt="KER-SPLAT!" border="0" height="220" src="kill9c.gif" width="400"/>
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      He removes 
      her frozen face from the liquid nitrogen and then smashes it into a 
      thousand bloody little pieces on the edge of the table. Tasty! I don't 
      care how many centuries into the future you are; science just isn't going 
      to become advanced enough to a repair a face that's been frozen in liquid 
      nitrogen and then smashed into into tiny shards.

      I suppose it should be no 
      surprise that my all-time favorite Jason kill comes from my favorite 
      Friday the 13th movie, Part VII. It's even Kane Hodder's favorite kill, so 
      you know it's a good one...

      Jason 
      slashes his way into Judy's tent and what does she do? She somehow reverts 
      back to the knowledge she possessed at age 5:
      <strong>
       if a monster comes into 
      your room, hide under the covers and it can't get you
      </strong>
      . She crawls 
      under her sleeping bag and quivers with fear. Sorry Judy, Jason doesn't 
      live by those childhood monster rules. He drags her out of the tent, still 
      in her sleeping bag and walks her over to a tree while she screams in a 
      crazed panic.

      He picks up 
      the sleeping bag and swings it right into the tree, silencing Judy and her 
      screams in an instant. It's violent, it's hilarious and it will always 
      remain my favorite kill of his. The filmmakers of Jason X apparently liked 
      this scene a lot too as they paid tribute to it in their film which I talk 
      about

      of you who are wondering why I didn't include any moments from Friday the

       My fave kill by Jason... I'd have to say the guy in the folding bed in Freddy Vs Jason.  Mainly since multiple machete stabbings wasn't enough for the un-dead freak.  But at least he was decent enough to fold the bed up after he was finished.

       Another fave kill is in "Jason Lives (part 6) where he rips a machete from a pissed off paint ball participent, and causes him to fly face first into a tree, revealing a generic "smiley face" where the branch was.
       <br/>
       Oh! and the drunk grave keeper, when he throws away his flask and jason catches it and stabs him in the throat with it.

       I've always been a big fan of #2 there (was the highlight of
       <i>
        Jason X
       </i>
       in my opinion), but the Triple Decapitation in
       <i>
        Part VI
       </i>
       and when he flings the glowstick-covered raver off into the horizon in
       <i>
        Freddy vs. Jason
       </i>
       are also faves (the latter mainly for the humor value).

       I've always wanted to see what exactly happened to the camp counselor in part 6 that opens the cabin door to see Jason standing there. Horrific shit happens, then she comes part way out the window and drug back in. Later the cabin is pretty much painted in blood. Did they ever find the body, though? I really don't remember.

       perfect showcase list. I have to agree again that the #1 kill was the sleeping bag kill. God I can't tell you how many times I dvr'd that when it comes on just to fast foward to that part, and watch it over and over again. Amazing Cinema right there

       Oi Rog, I'm not sure if you've been told about this or not, but Firefox and probably newer versions of other browsers don't allow the "hover-text" on pictures via the old misuse of the "alt" function.  But you can still get it by using "title" where you would have used "alt" before.  I seem to remember this article having hover-text ("*BINK!*" for Julius), so I don't know if you actively decided to stop doing that or just didn't bother figuring out how.  I remember that it was always hilarious when you did have it.  Update on that, if you don't mind?  (P.S. - Sorry if I'm bugging you too much with critical-seeming comments.  I'm a big fan of your work.)
