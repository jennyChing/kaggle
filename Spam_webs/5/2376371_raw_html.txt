                     In 1981, Idol remixed and re-released "Dancing with Myself" as a solo single, toning down its aggressive guitar sound and instead emphasizing its power pop or pop rock elements. Two versions were issuedthe 3:20 single version (which was later included on Idol's

                     Idol plays "Dancing with Myself" at most of his concerts, always introducing the song as having been originally written and recorded by Generation X. Since its release, the song has become something of a sports anthem.

                      Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel
                     </i>
                     (2009). It was written and produced by Carey, Christopher "Tricky" Stewart and Terius "The-Dream" Nash, and was released as the album's lead single on June 16, 2009. The song draws musical influences from R&amp;B and hip hop music, and is built around a thumping bass line. Additionally, the song is accentuated by hand claps, while Carey's voice is processed with auto-tune. Lyrically, the song describes Mariah's dilemma regarding constant claims of a prior relationship from rapper Eminem, although he is not specifically mentioned.
                     <br/>
                     The song received generally positive reviews from music critics who highlighted it as a stand-out track from
                     <i>
                      Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel
                     </i>
                     . Many reviewers complimented its clever lyrics and strong beat, while others criticized the song's usage of auto-tune on Carey's vocals. At the time of the song's release, "Obsessed" was the center of controversy, as critics and the media suggested Carey was aiming it at American rapper Eminem, who had negatively referenced her several times in songs.
                     <br/>
                     "Obsessed" peaked at number seven on the
                     <i>
                      Billboard
                     </i>
                     Hot 100, becoming Carey's 27th top-ten hit on the chart. In terms of total top-ten chart entries among all artists in the chart's history, Carey tied for fifth place after the song's peak, with Janet Jackson and Elton John. Internationally, the song was not released throughout parts of Europe, as Island Records decided to give priority to the album's second single, Carey's cover of Foreigner's classic "I Want to Know What Love Is". "Obsessed" peaked within the top 10 in France and Italy, and in the top 20 in Australia, Belgium, Canada and Japan.
                     <br/>
                     The song's music video was directed by film-maker Brett Ratner, who Carey has previously worked with on other music videos. Throughout the video, Carey plays both herself and the character of the male stalker, dressed in a bellhop uniform, as well as a gray hoodie and sweatpants. Two videos were shot for "Obsessed", one for the original version, and one for the remixed version, which features rapper Gucci Mane. The video was shot predominantly at the Plaza Hotel, and on the streets of New York City. After several photographs of Carey dressed as the stalker were leaked, tabloids immediately compared Carey's costume to Eminem's usual attire. Carey performed the song live on the fourth season of

                   is a film genre targeted at teenagers and young adults in which the plot is based upon the special interests of teenagers, such as coming of age, first love, rebellion, conflict with parents, teen angst or alienation. Often these normally serious subject matters are presented in a glossy, stereotyped or trivialized way. For legal reasons, many teenage characters are portrayed by young adults. Some teen films appeal to young males while others appeal to young females.

                     Films in this genre are often set in high schools, or contain characters that are of high school age. Sexual themes are also common, as are crude forms of humor.

                      Dangerously in Love

                     (2003). It was written by Robert Waller, Angela Beyinc, Scott Storch and Knowles, and produced by the Storch and Beyinc. The song was released by Columbia Records as the fourth and final single from the album to US radios on March 14, 2004, and was available as a physical release the next month. An official remix featuring Lil Kim was released in the following month, as well. Musically, "Naughty Girl" is an R&amp;B and disco song that interpolates from the Donna Summer's song, "Love to Love You Baby" (1975). Influenced by Arabic music, dancehall and reggae, the song contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, leading up to a desire for a one-night stand.
                     <br/>
                     "Naughty Girl" was received with positive reviews by music critics, who praised Knowles' assertive vocals and the song's sensual vibe. However, opinions about how convincingly Knowles was able to portray a naughty girl were polarized. The song was nominated in the category Best R&amp;B/Soul Single by a Female Artist at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. "Naughty Girl" peaked at number three on the US
                     <i>
                      Billboard
                     </i>
                     Hot 100, becoming Knowles' fourth consecutive release from the album to reach the top five on that chart. The single reached the top ten in New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. "Naughty Girl" was certified gold by the American, Australian and New Zealander trade associations of record producers.
                     <br/>
                     The single's accompanying music video was directed by Jake Nava and was inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film,
                     <i>
                      The Band Wagon
                     </i>
                     . In it, Knowles flirtatiously and seductively dances with R&amp;B singer Usher to portray a naughty girl. The video received four nominations at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards and eventually won the Best Female Video accolade. The song was included on Knowles' set lists on her tours.

                   is a domed rotunda on the grounds of the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Designed by Pearson and Darling and completed in 1907, it was inspired by the grand theatre of the Sorbonne and the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford. While the building's namesake purpose is to host the annual convocation ceremonies, it also serves as the venue for academic and social functions that involve large audiences throughout the year.

                   <i>
                    Between the Lines
                   </i>
                   (her seventh studio album) and as a single. Ian's most successful recording, the song is a commentary on adolescent cruelty, the illusion of popularity, and teenage angst, as reflected upon from the maturity of adulthood. It is told from the point of view of a woman who was an "ugly duckling" as a girl and ignored in high school while the popular girls got all the attention.

It was written and produced by The Neptunes, a duo that had made the majority of Kelis' songs in the past. According to Kelis, "milkshake" in the song is used as a metaphor for "something that makes women special." The song is noted for its euphemistic chorus and low beat R&amp;B sound.
                     <br/>
                     The song peaked at number three on the US

                     Hot 100 chart in December, 2003, becoming Kelis' best charting single in the country to this day. The song achieved commercial success internationally, as it topped the chart in Ireland, and peaked inside the top three in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. "Milkshake" was certified gold in the United States, where it has sold 883,000 paid downloads. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance in 2004.

He started out his musical career playing live (guitar) and doing studio recording sessions (guitar, mandolin, banjo, balalaika, charango and various instruments). He also pursued his other interests, which were writing orchestral and band arrangements for singers, and big band writing and arranging. Through this early work he met a group of TV composers who were busy and needed someone to help orchestrate and copy their music for weekly recording sessions. That experience led to other opportunities and started him on a new path, and he soon transitioned to film orchestration. To this day he still works in film primarily, but also occasionally in television and video games.

                  The real Janis Ian was one of the first musical guests on the first Saturday Night Live episode, in which she sang the song "At Seventeen", which can be heard playing in the background when the girls are fighting at Regina's house.

                     (born October 9, 2008) is a pet dog of the Obama family, the First Family of the United States. Bo is a neutered male Portuguese Water Dog. President Barack Obama and his family were given the dog as a gift after months of speculation about the breed and identity of their future pet. The final choice was made in part because Malia Obama's allergies dictated a need for a hypoallergenic breed. Bo has occasionally been called "First Dog". In August 2013 Bo was joined by Sunny, a female dog of the same breed.

When the village was annexed by Toronto in 1908, the name of the street the school was located on was changed from Charles Street to Malvern Avenue (as Toronto already had a Charles Street), and the name of the institution was changed shortly thereafter.

                     </b>
                     is a Toronto high school that was founded in 1903 as "East Toronto High School", in what was then the village of East Toronto. When the village was annexed by Toronto in 1908, the name of the street the school was located on was changed from Charles Street to Malvern Avenue (as Toronto already had a Charles Street), and the name of the institution was changed shortly thereafter.
                     <br/>
                     The statue that stands on the east side of the school on Malvern Avenue just outside of the library was built in 1922 in honour of the students that had attended Malvern C.I. and died in World War I.
                     <br/>
                     Malvern Collegiate is located in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood known as The Beaches. Notable alumni include Glenn Gould, Robert Fulford, and Don Getty who were all at the school at the same time in the 1950s. Norman Jewison, Bruce Kidd, Teresa Stratas and Jack Kent Cooke also attended the school.
                     <br/>
                     Malvern celebrated its centennial in 2003. In 2006,
                     <i>
                      Toronto Life
                     </i>
                     magazine stated that Malvern CI had the best English program in Toronto, a notable change from the 1980s, when the same magazine rated Malvern's English department as being in the bottom five of all Toronto collegiates. The school's mascot is the Black Knight, and the school colours are red and black.
                     <br/>
                     Coincidentally, there is also a Toronto neighbourhood called Malvern, but the school and the neighbourhood share no connection. The Malvern neighbourhood is located approximately 16km (9.9mi) northeast of Malvern Collegiate.
                     <br/>
                     Malvern won the 2009 Anne Hope Award for its contributions in promoting human rights and equity education.
                     <br/>
                     In November, 2011, a ceremony rededicating the statue located on the east side of the school was held, a week before Remembrance Day of that year to commemorate the repairs done to the arm. Less than 48 hours later, the statue was vandalized.

                     "Beautiful" has been widely embraced as an anthem by the LGBT community for its message of self-empowerment and inner beauty. An accompanying music video was directed by Jonas kerlund, and earned Aguilera a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of gay and transgender people. In 2011, UK LGBT rights organization Stonewall named "Beautiful" the most empowering song of the previous decade for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. In 2009,
