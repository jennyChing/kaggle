     August 1990, St. Marks Place. Priscilla Forsyth, one month shy of her fourteenth birthday and just home from summer camp, straddles one of the two lion statues guarding the downward staircase to the apartment building her family has owned since 1975. Naturally blonde Liza and dyed blonde Margaret idle with her. Its hot out, and Priscilla is becoming more curious about the world beyond her sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_a366cd44e42b4279847b15746db1d869">
     An energetic kid with a scrawny but chiseled build named Harold Hunter rides up on his BMX bike. Ive never seen blonde people in New York before, he tells the girls, giggling. He was from the Campos Plaza Housing Projects nearbya different world, to be sure, although hed obviously seen blonde girls before.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_1d6bf531c61e4c0d854b33980b8f1eb3">
     That was his little excuse to start talking to us, Priscilla recalls. Harold was known for that. The superlatives, the tall tales and jokes, the genuinely amicable first encountersanyone who knew him knew that was Harold.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_14c323eceae74177a2e2f88ab5dda789">
     A month later, Priscilla and her friends were meandering downtown drinking forties, celebrating her birthday. They passed the Astor Place cube, a favored location for New York Citys premiere skateboard crew at the time. Priscilla and her girlfriends exchanged numbers with the skaters, and joined them the next day at the Brooklyn Banks, a world-renowned skateboarding mecca underneath the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridgethat is, until the city shutit down a few years ago to use as storage space for bridge restoration.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_b4d5f7b8bf42431a84c77509fc77e4eb">
     When the girls arrived at the Banks, they met Harold and his friends, an infamous crew of amateur and professional skateboarders who rode alongside moving taxicabs and jumped off building and museum steps. Wherever they went throughout the city, the boys rode with a gutsy and fluid style. It looked like art on a skateboard, says Peter Bici, a skater and close friend of Harolds. It was a combination of New York City and the movement of streets and constant continuity of the citys energy. The kids loved each other like family, and didnt give a shit about what anyone else thought of them. We were minding our own business, says Peter. We dont bother you. You dont bother us. We all had each others backs. It was an era when skateboarding wasnt cool. If they heard wheels coming down the street, theyd run after them.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_ce48c63376e04232b85620cefe30a549">
     When Harold saw the girls, invited by his other friends, he made sure everyone knew he met them first. Priscilla says this now, twenty-three years later, imitating Harold in the nasal, raspy voice his loved ones mimic when telling Harold stories; the impersonation brings a comical lightness to the forefront, just like Harold always did.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_b370e927863f4f2cbd1b5f7dcc65d166">
     Harold started regularly coming to the Forsyths for dinner. He became Priscillas surrogate brother. Families didnt adopt Harold, he adopted families, says Priscillas sister Jessica.
    </p>
    <p class="TextBlock" data-align="left" data-role="paragraph" data-type="text" id="text_4fc8f719492941c685be4f559dd94464">
     Priscilla, now thirty-six, and Jessica, thirty-nine, with a black father from Grenada and a white mother from the Cleveland suburbs, went to the prestigious Hunter College Elementary and High Schools, commuting each weekday to the Upper East Side. But it was in the East Village where they met the skater crew, and Harold started bringing his friends over to the the house too. Soon enough, the Forsyths apartment on St. Marks Place became another stomping ground, a clubhouse of sorts for this group of lost boys. Many, like Harold, hailed from broken homes.

     When the 1995 film
     <em>
      Kids
     </em>
     , written by Harmony Korine and directed by Larry Clark, was released, Newsweek called it astonishing; Janet Maslin of the
     <em>
      New York Times
     </em>
     said it was "a wake-up call to the modern world." The Motion Picture Association of America initially branded the film with an NC-17 rating; upstart film producers Harvey and Bob Weinstein created a new distribution company to release it unrated into theaters.

     In his July 28, 1995, review, the late Roger Ebert wrote, Most kids are not like those in
     <em>
      Kids
     </em>
     , and never will be, I hope. But some are, and they represent a failure of home, school, church and society. They could have been raised in a zoo, educated only to the base instincts.

     The main character of Telly, played by Leo Fitzpatrick, is a scrawny, cocky kid on a perpetual hunt to seduce young New York City virgins; he and his sidekick Casper, a hyperactive foul-mouthed slice of authenticity played by Justin Pierce, traverse the city from sunup to sundown to complete their quest. Meanwhile, in an apartment somewhere, un-chaperoned teen girls wax poetic about sex. Two girlsJennie, played by Chlo Sevigny, and Ruby, played by Rosario Dawsongo for AIDS tests; Jennie comes up HIV positive. Shes only had sex once, with Telly, and she sets out on her own hunt to find him. The boys meet up with their skater friends in Washington Square Park, some boys and girls break into a closed pool and go swimming, Jennie takes drugs at a nightclub, and they all end up at a house party where four little kids shoved side by side on a couch pass a joint back and forth.Telly screws his second virgin of the day just as Jennie arrives at the party to find Telly still inside his conquest. She passes out herself and is raped by Casper. The next morning, Casper wakes up naked on a couch and says directly to the camera, Jesus Christ, what happened?

     <em>
      Kids

     came from the minds of Korine, a skate kid from Tennessee whose grandmother lived in Queens and hung out with Harold and his friends, and Clark, already known for his gritty, sexualized youth photography. (Clark had started photographing the crew in the early 1990s.) It was the first film for both, and the camera barely leaves the kids, none of whom were actors at the time; all were plucked from Harolds skater crew and elsewhere downtown.

     Those of us who watched

     as adolescents, growing up in an era before iPhones, Facebook, and Tiger Moms, had our minds blown from wherever we were watchingwhether it was the Angelika Film Center on the Lower East Side or our parents Midwestern basements. We were captivated by the entirely unsupervised teens smoking blunts, drinking forties, hooking up, running amok and reckless through the New York City streets. Simultaneously, the driving storyline highlighted the terror of HIV and AIDS, which was at its apex in the mid-nineties.

     Justin Pierce, who played Casper, took his life in July 2000, the first of several tragedies for the kids. Harold, who played himself in the film and is best remembered for swinging his dick around in the pool scenehe was that kid who wasnt afraid, who radiated a magnetic and infectious energy both on and off screenis gone too. He died in February 2006 from a drug-induced heart attack.

     The film grossed millions and deeply impacted the lives and careers of all involved. Korine, who just released his newest film
     <em>
      Spring Breakers
     </em>
     , went on to artistic claim and fame. Clark continues making films and controversial photography, but
     <em>
      Kids
     </em>
     remains by far his most well-known project. Several kids went on to successful acting careers, most notably Chlo Sevigny and Rosario Dawson. Zoo York, the skate brand created in 1993 and home base for many in the crew, blew up overnight. New York skaters went from mini-celebrities in the extreme sport world to global notoriety; while on a Zoo York skate tour, Harold was recognized by film fans as far away as Japan.

     In a coffee shop on the Lower East Side this spring, Peter Bici, a pro skateboarding legend who appeared in the film, tells me its not about himthe film, the interview, this article. Now a New York City fireman with a wife and daughter, Peter speaks with a thick, classic New York accent as tears well up in his eyes. Its about Harold and Justin, he says. I just want to keep Justin and Harold alive with these stories. Its not about me, really. Its not. Its about them. Thats why Im here. They still live on.

     The kids were a crew of about sixteen, maybe forty if the outer circle was around. The core clique was all in

     , with roles ranging from starring to un-credited. Their surrogate parents were Rodney Smith, Eli Morgan Gesner and Adam Schatz, the then twenty-something founders of Zoo York. Previously, Rodney had founded SHUT, the first local brand to design boards that could withhold the blow of curbs, rails, and jumps to accommodate the changing face of New York skating. Zoo Yorks Meatpacking District headquarters was their clubhouse, and Eli, a club promoter, was the crews link to New York nightlifehe developed the skating ramp inside the infamous Tunnel nightclub.

     Wed go to the Tunnel every Friday night or Saturday night, says Jefferson Pang, forty-one, who is widely recognized as the first New York City skater to make it as a pro, and whose own Zoo York deck model was featured on the films poster, clutched by Harold.

     Harmony didnt create this mysterious subculture of skateboarders in New York City, says Jefferson. That was our lives. Minus the whole virgin hunter part of it. Tellys virgin hunter character, popping cherries from morning to night, was hyperbolized for the film, fictional material Korine added to make it more "Hollywood." [Harmony] was kind of there when we were hanging out at Washington Square Park or Astor, says Jefferson, but he doesnt recall him joining them on skate missions.

     Korine, nineteen at the time, and Clark, then over fifty, wrangled the troops from the skate clique, supplementing them with more non-actors from Washington Square Park and the club scene, and across downtownincluding Chlo Sevigny, from tony Darien, Connecticut, who had been hanging out with the crew in Washington Square Park for years. They plucked a then fifteen-year-old Rosario Dawson from her stoop in the East Village. Vibe magazine was shooting a commercial on her block, and her father told her to go downstairs to get discovered.

     Jon Jonny Boy Abrahams, a club kid from TriBeCa, was originally cast as a random guy in the club scene making out with two girls.

I definitely had to work for their affection, a little bit.

     The Forsyths apartment building was part of the set, as a stand-in for Tellys house, and while Jessica didnt want to be on camera, Priscilla was one of the girls at the beginning jabbering about sex and boys. Everyone else who was in appeared in the notorious Washington Square Park scene, sitting side-by-side in a massive clump, skateboards in hand. In that scene, Casper, played by Justin, skates off and accidentally knocks a bystander, credited as Hoodlum. Casper apologizes, the Hoodlum says, Watch where the fuck you skatin at. A scuffle ensues, Harold runs over and hits Hoodlum on the head with a skateboard, the other kids catapult from the fountain ledge, and everyone beats the shit out of Hoodlum. To punctuate the massacre, Casper swings the bottom of a skateboard into Hoodlums face as a shirtless Peter Bici holds him up, Hoodlums mouth gapping open with head cocked forward, eyes shut. Telly hocks a loogie, spits it onto Hoodlums left temple, and Casper leans down to say, Now get in my way, bitch! The crew cackles; adults cringed.

Even the scene with Javier Nunez, at fourteen, by far the youngest of the skate crew, and three other little kids mashed on a couch smoking a joint and pontificating about god and lifethat too was real.

The fact that it was a suicide is such a difficult thing to deal with, says Priscilla, who, while a teacher in Compton, lived across the street from Justin and his wife in Los Angeles. Justin was an amazingly wonderful person, but he also suffered from a lot of emotional pain in his life.

     [Harolds] like a brother to me, says Jefferson. Wed always be fighting, but I would kill someone for him. Weve traveled the world together and its always been like I kind of have to be his handler and bring him down to reality and put him in check because he always wanted to have as much fun as possible. And it was always at his expense. He was never conscious of anything he was putting in his body. The way he ate, or his lifestyle. But that was the thing about Harold, he was such a free spirit. He lived every moment to the fullest. To the last day, he was still being Harold. We always were concerned: whats Harold gonna be like as an adult?

     The kids who are skaters today, they have some similarities to those guys, she says. These kids are nowhere near as rough in terms of what theyre dealing with. Theyre not sort of skaters by necessity. Its by choice. But I also think theres something about skateboarding as a community that really does take care of each other and teach kids to be sort of entrepreneurial and independent. Thats really the same as it always has been. Skateboarding was so amazing for Harold and we wanted to bring these kinds of opportunities to kids like Harold.

     The Foundation sends kids to Woodward, a residential action sports camp in Pennsylvania where Harold had gone and loved as heaven on earth, says Jessica, returning as a professional skateboarder to work with kids. This past winter, they sent a handful of young skaters to the Dominican Republic on tour. Foundation intern Wade Yates, twenty-three, says he was deeply touched by all of the skateboarding youth they met in the DR. I mean, the whole country needs help, but definitely the skaters are hurting a lot, he says.
