    There are many African Americans in the Mathematical
Sciences who owe their preparation to "white" Americans.
We take this opportunity to present a special appreciation to
two such individuals,

    Lee Lorch was born in New York City in 1915
and graduated from Cornell University in 1935. He did his graduate
work at the University of Cincinnati, obtaining his Ph.D. degree
in 1941. After some time in mathematically related war work, he
joined the US army and saw service in India and the Pacific between
1943 and 1946. His first academic position was at the City College
of New York and his most recent is at York University (in Toronto
Canada) from which he retired officially in 1985.

    Lorch has been a tireless fighter for human
rights and educational opportunities for women and underrepresented
minorities. His long, courageous and continuing struggle for civil
rights and for equal educational opportunities for minority groups
was carried on at great personal cost including blacklisting which
forced him to move to Canada in 1959 as a political refugee from
the United States. For example, in the late forties, the Lorches
attempted to end racial segregation in Stuyvesant Town, a large
housing development in New York City. As a consequence, Lee was
dismissed from the City College of New York, and subsequently
was dismissed from his new position at Pennsylvania State University
for the same reason, because he allowed a black family to occupy
his Stuyvesant Town apartment.

    When the United States Supreme Court ruled
against school segregation in 1954, Lorch was chair of the mathematics
department at Fisk University in Nashville. The Lorches then tried
to enrol their daughter in the school nearest their home, a black
school. Subsequently in 1955, he was summoned before the infamous
House Committee on Un-American Activities, and subsequently dropped
from the faculty by the predominantly white board of trustees
at Fisk University, over the opposition of his mathematics colleagues
and the leading black trustees.

    Grace Lorch, who died in 1974, had long been
active in supporting the rights of minority groups. A teacher
in Boston, she served as President of the Boston Teachers Union
and as a member of the Boston Central Labour Council. She was
the first teacher to challenge a Boston school regulation that
female teachers resign after marriage, although unsuccessfully.

    Related to Lee Lorch's 5 year tenure on the
faculty of
    <b>
     Fisk University
    </b>
    , the following is quoted from
a talk by Lee Lorch, at the Special Session on the history of
the American Mathematics Society, Cincinnati, January1994:
   </font>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    This was first made a matter of record in 1951 when I was
  teaching at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, a leading
  historically Black university. The Southeast regional meeting
  of the Mathemtics Association of America took place with Vanderbilt
  University as host. There was an official banquet at which the
  national President of the Mathemtics Association of America was
  the speaker. Using rather vulgar language, the chair of the local
  arrangements committee, a Vanderbilt professor, said that no
  tickets would be available to Negro members. I'm using the polite
  version of the word he employed.
   </p>
   <p>
    On April 20, 1951, my department sent a letter to the Board
  of Governors of the Mathemtics Association of America and (well
  aware that the American Mathematics Society behaved no better)
  also to the Council of the American Mathematics Society, describing
  the situation and making certain suggestions. Then, with a covering
  note, I sent it to
    <i>
     Science
    </i>
    [see Science, August 10, 1951,
  pp. 161-162. and reprinted in Black Mathematicians and their
  Works] there being no American Mathematics Society or Mathemtical
  Association of America outlets for letters then...

    The Lorch's then moved to Little Rock, Arkansas
where Lee taught at Philander Smith College. There, in Sept. 1957,
the Arkansas National Guard, acting on direct orders from the
state's governor, surrounded Little Rock Central High School in
battle dress for the purpose of keeping out the nine black students
whose enrolment in that school had just been ordered by the U.S.
federal court.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    One of these students, a 15-year-old girl,
was inadvertently separated from the others, and was menaced by
a mob. Grace Lorch extricated her from the mob and, despite the
abuse showered on both of them, took her home. The funding of
the small black college Philander Smith was then placed in jeopardy
so Lorch was forced out. The persecution of the Lorch family continued.
For comforting the frightened schoolgirl, Grace Lorch was summoned
before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Dynamite was
placed under the Lorch family's garage door, and their daughter
was beaten while at school.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Eventually, it became impossible for the family
to obtain employment in the United States. They moved to Canada,
and in 1959 Lorch joined the faculty of the University of Alberta,
where he taught until he came to York in 1968.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Professor Lorch has made distinguished contributions
to several subfields of classical analysis, including real analysis,
summability theory, Fourier analysis, ordinary differential equations
and special functions. His publications, spanning over fifty years,
have illuminated several difficult problems and have generated
international interest. His life-long devotion to scholarship
has been recognized in a number of ways including Fellowship in
the Royal Society of Canada, service on Grant Selection Committees
for the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,
election to the Councils of the Canadian and American Mathematical
Societies, and to the Council of the Royal Society of Canada,
and invitations to lecture in several countries.

   <font size="+1">
    Professor Lorch moved to Canada in 1959 and
spent nine years at the University of Alberta before moving to
York University in 1968. He is well known for speaking out on
behalf of mathematicians (and others) who are the victims of discrimination,
aggression, occupation or economic blockade. He is a strong advocate
of peaceful coexistence and of the role of scientists in this
effort. Some understanding of his views on how mathematics can
be a force for international understanding can be gained from
his account of the 1966 International Congress of Mathematicians
(Canad. Math. Bull. 10 (1967), 157-162; abridged version Science,
155 (1967), 1038-1039).
