          The King of Darkness gives a profoundly personal breakdown of the biggest independent Rap album of 2009
         </h3>
         <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
           The best-selling independent Hip Hop artist in the world should be in complete celebratory mode right about now. After selling 30,000 copies of his new full-length,
           <em>
            K.O.D.
           </em>
           , in just the first week of the albums release (a feat even most major-label artists cant seem to pull off these days), the self-proclaimed King of Darkness,
           <strong>
            Tech N9ne
           </strong>
           , should be enjoying the fruits of the relentless tour grind that has helped the Kansas City rapid-fire rhymer secure a dedicated following of well over a 100,000 loyal supporters (a.ka. Technicians) who made it possible for Tech with his last solo release, 2008s double-disc
           <em>
            Killer,
           </em>
           to reach the monumental mark of scanning over one million albums total for his nearly-decades worth of solo offerings.
          </p>
          <p>
           But its hard for
           <strong>
            Tech
           </strong>
           to fully enjoy his historic success when so much personal darkness has engulfed his life of late. His mother is now suffering with
           <strong>
            Lupus
           </strong>
           (in addition to a nearly lifelong battle with epilepsy), his one-year-old nephew tragically died in a car crash just a few weeks before the release of
           <em>
            K.O.D.
           </em>
           (and the night
           <strong>
            Tech
           </strong>
           was to depart for his latest tour), and so the Caribou Lou sipper is anything but in the mood to make any of the traditional party-and-bullshit songs that typically make their way into the
           <strong>
            Killa Klown
           </strong>
           s usual mix of the macabre and the mournful, the gangsta and the girl-crazy. And it was the dark themes dealt with on
           <em>
            K.O.D.
           </em>
           that were expounded on by
           <strong>
            Tech
           </strong>
           to
           <strong>
            HipHopDX
           </strong>
           recently for arguably one of the deepest discussions of the always engaging artists epic career.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            HipHopDX: I wanna start off with a really easy question...is there a God? [Laughs] I thought there was, but then I heard Show Me A God and now I need a 100% proof too.

I have faith that there is something there greater than us. I have no proof. Theres signs like the sun, and the moon, and birth of a baby. There are signs theres something greater, but theres always room for doubt. [But] I dont wanna doubt, put it like that. But its certain things in

And when man writes these things, do you sometimes have to use your imagination because it aint always a 100% together? So, how can I be a 100% on something that aint 100% all the time?

            Before my mom was sick, [I questioned] Darwinism and Creationism.

[Laughs] I aint never caught the Holy Ghost. So before mom, I had a song way back in the day called Fuck Your Religion. Because, I was raised a Christian. When I was 12, my mom married a Muslim. And he told me the stuff the Christians believe wasnt 100. And then, I started seeing flaws in Islam. Ive worked with Muslims who follow the remedies of

           So, [after I was told she had] pancreatitis, I flew home from Winter Park, Colorado. [I] stood by her side. She was losing all the color in her lips. Her lips turned black and everything. She couldnt talk and they had this thing in her mouth and she was looking at me with her eyes, [and a] tear [started] coming out. Im like, why would she suffer all her life like this? And my family [is] real religious. All my aunties and uncles telling me [saying], 
           <em>
            The Lord just test the righteous,

            Oh, really?
           </em>
            Testing her all her muthafuckin life? She just turned 55 October 26th. She was 54 [when this was happening]. I said in the song [Show Me A God], 
           <em>
            And she only 54, in a ward watching a war / Thats more blood and gore, and she tore, cause people are so deceiving / And Im on the floor, cause with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor, having all the soldiers screaming / Show me a God!
           </em>
            Cause she always used to be watching TV, [and] she was real compassionate like, watch the news and cry like,

            Im like,

           A real angel, man. So why in the fuck wouldnt I think the way I think [about God]? Like please man, show me something. This angel of all people is the most tormented? You mean to God damn tell me she gotta go through all this pain all her muthafuckin life for a God to say, okay, you truly believe in me? Fuck that, man! And, Im not cursin at God. Im cursin at the situation, with my people telling me that,
           <em>
            He tries the righteous and test our belief.
           </em>
            Really? Testing mama with epilepsy? Testing mama with lupus? Testing mama with pancreatitis that was about to kill her? Testing mama by putting her in a psychiatric ward all her muthafuckin life?! Yeah, that make me feel real good [about God], bro. Why wouldnt I write Show Me A God [at that point], tell me that?

            to make you do something stupid to end up fucked up, even though youre righteous. So karma, thats what it means, what goes around comes around. So I always believe that. And that comes with my belief in God.

            DX: Do you really believe spirits, or shadows, are following you? You sure it aint just the police [Laughs]?

            Tech N9ne:
           </strong>
           [Laughs] I know it aint the police, cause the police pulls us over. The shadows disappear. And I think it has to do a lot with drugs, back in the day just seeing things [while high]. But, I just think it comes with shadows period, man. I dont really know [if spirits are really haunting me]. Even in the song I said I dont know. I still dont know. It might just be some shit that the eyes is just doing to ya.

            DX: On one of the illest joints on K.O.D., Demons, you talk about those thangs that make you do bad things. But is that some supernatural, evil spirit directing you to do bad things, or is that just the selfish nature of man that you or anybody else cant always keep in check?
            <br/>
            Tech N9ne:
           </strong>
           Im thinking its the selfish nature of man, because Ive never seen a spirit. They saying its evil spirits. My family taught me to believe that theres evil spirits. Thats evil spirits in you. Theres a demon in you thats making you do this. Its the devil inside you, youknowhatImsizzlin? So, logically Im thinking its man, being weak, giving in to

           . Cmon man, thats not disciplined. That aint what my Muslim stepfather taught me. He taught me discipline. Be able to not do these things because this thing will make you live longer. If you drink alcohol, youre not gonna live longer. If you eat pork, youre not gonna live longer. Shit like that. So discipline is what my logic would say [is the real problem], but my

           and my family say thats evil spirits. So its confusion, I dont have no answers for you. I dont have no 100% answers for you.

           I did! Im still asking em. That makes sense, dont it? I mean the album just came out homie, [so] Im still asking em. This is my mindframe right now. These questions are being asked [and] just because I asked em dont mean I answered em. The only way its gonna be answered is if God comes and how they saycaught up in the rapture. All the righteous will be caught up in the rapture. So thats gonna be [when I get] my answer.

            Im lustful. A lot of women raised me. My father wasnt there. My uncles was there. My uncles

           , they taught me. But at the same time, [there were] a lot of women around me. So I learned that God said one [woman] to each, after there was jealousy in the home when you [could] have 10 wives. So, I know what [a man with] more than one [woman] does to a Christian woman. Shes not having that. So, in my brain, because of what they taught me when I was younger, Im not supposed to be unfaithful to a woman, especially when you get married. And I was married for nine years. So, thats my sin, lust. Im girl-crazy. Thats my major sin. They say, 
           <em>
            Theres no sin greater than the other.

           Bullshit. You go out here and cut a babys head off, opposed to stealing a piece of candy, then nigga thats a bigger sin.

Theres nothing biblical, its nothing  It just looks like a crucifix. But, its nothing biblical. Its nothing that should be considered scary. Its just that people try to say my stuff is evil.

            Jason Whitlock
           </strong>
           was trying to say on the album. Its pretty funny to me, all those ideas about me being the devil, when my mom [said] Im her angel sent down here to protect the lost souls, and take care of lost souls. She used to tell me that ever since I was little. But when you do something different, people are gonna dissect it. And I have really religious overtones [in my music], if you listen, even though theres [still] confusion [about religion]. And theres always gonna be [that confusion]. Such is life. So, its scary [to Whitlock and other outsiders]. And I poke at people like what if theyre right [and Im evil]. [Makes ghostly sound] Woooooo-ah-ah-ah-ah. Its funny to me.

             I've been rockin with Tech for years, my brother introduced me to Tech N9ne and Strange music bacc wen Anghellic and Absolute Power were still brand new, its a trip to hear that he's dealt with similar issues in his life like i have, things like his mom battling siccness and disease her whole life, the same was with my mom as well, so I know the kind of pressure and stress that puts on you. Tech was one of my inspirations to start making music, and one of my goals is to do a song with him. People always seem to misunderstand him but its because they keep a closed mind. Always keep it 100. SALUTE!

             It is unfortunate that so many people are willing to judge and spew hate at Tech N9ne. I bet most of this hate is coming from so called "believers" that are not supposed to pass judgement in the first place. Tech N9ne is one of the greatest rappers of the last 10+ years. There is no logical reason to jump to such silly conclusions about him, just because he questions things in life. He has questions and he raps about them. Isn't that what rap was supposed to be about? Leave the man alone. @ Tech don't change nothin man.

             There are people in this world that worships the devil and excepts him in their lives, and there are people who are possessed by the devil, they don't want to be it just happened like that because they are weak in their souls... Remember we are not fighting against flesh and blood but against principalities,power etc... Souls r being lost because of Techs confused mind set and possession. No Tech is not a devil worshiper but he's possessed, he doesn't want to be but he's saying there's nothing he can do about, but there is a lot he can do about it first he needs to start rebuking the demons with in him... For the love of money is the root of all evil.

             If Tech n9ne would stop making this evil music and let it go and let God his family wouldn't be going through all that they are, if he start rebuking the demons inside of him they will flee from him and his family, but no he excepts them in his life so therefor he's going to continue to keep going through what he;s going through with his family especially his mother....Believe not unto your own understanding tech, God works in mysterious ways Tech, don't ever question God... Read your Bible and if you don't understand the Bible ask God to help you understand and he will show you...

             I am incredibly impressed with Tech as of late. he's really stepping completely out of his shell, and going " all in"

I'm so glad he broke out with 6's and 7's and I hope he finds true happiness.

Oh, and David. It's a good verse, it is. But you seem like you're just emulating ICP here. Just a bunch of kids who weren't cool enough to be preppy and latched onto another cliche. Juggalos.

I think Tech embodies free thinking and individualism, don't be a conformist man, just rep tech, KC, or which ever part of his music you enjoy most.

             i liked tech and i think i can understand the situation he is in somehow, but what the fuck is that about sending his mom money for her birthday?? if he cares so much thinks she is an angel and shit why the hell he's not with her at that day?!? sending her money...nigga please.. that's whack!! and why isn't he using his position in praising positive vibes.. thats something he could do when is mom is asking him when she sees terrible things on television... he is just taking her as an excuse in order to praise hate musik... if he would really love his mother and take care of her so much you would not go ahead an send her some lousy money instead of showing up to her b-day personaly... whack faggot!!

               I'm sure you have been there for every birthday for anyone that you love in your family too right. How are you gonna criticize someone else's life? If he wasn't there for his mother's birthday....so what...it's his life. You should post a story about someone you care about on here so I can knock you for something you didn't do. Oh wait, that wouldn't work, cuz ur perfect. It also wouldn't work because nobody knows who you are and they don't care about you. Call Tech what you want and hate all you want, but you still cared enough to read this whole article and post on it you self inportant tampon

             This was a great interview and I commend dx for this. Its great that an artist can be successful without the major label influencing his art. I totally undersand where Tech is coming from. Religions are belief systems that have most people narrow-minded and not able to explore other sciences or schools of thought. I truly feel Tech, I was raised Christian and I see a lot of things that make me wonder why some of those that are so immersed in their religion are being penalized by God. We have to open our minds and its great that an MC like Tech can come along and influence thought. I have much love for MC's that make me want to go study and read up. There is a lane for eveyone in the music game but MC's like Tech, Immortal Technique, Nas, Dead Prez, Brand Nubian, PE, Jay-Elec, Mos, Kweli, Sha Stimuli, Erykah Badu, Dre 3000 just to name a few are much needed in these serious times that we are currently facing. As far as the evil comments or lables Tech is bashed with makes no sense, at least Tech is trying to find his way. Remember people the "devil" was once an angel casted from the heavens. Whatever you believe or have faith in be sure to study outside of the main text so that it can enhance whatever denomination you embrace and never feel like YOUR denomination is the only gateway to salvation. Peace and blessings to all
