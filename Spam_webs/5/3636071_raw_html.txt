      New Locust Toybox album "Stringland"
     </span>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Hello. I have made a new Locust Toybox album called "Stringland". Locust Toybox is music I make with real instruments, computers, samples and a bit of my voice. I try and sound like nothing else but I'm sure it'll remind you of something. I use Locust Toybox music in almost all of my cartoons......but this album is not just background ambience - it is meant for listening to. Some of the songs are quite upbeat. I make music that I would want to hear. Anyway you've probably already decided whether or not to give it a try, so I'll waste your time no longer and throw you a link. You can listen to it for free or buy it for a fiver (that's 5) - but I'll also make it free to download eventually. I just thought I'd see if anyone would ever pay for my music (and some people have already - so thanks for that)

      Two Unreleased Cartoons From 2008
     </span>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Shut up! Two updates inside the same year? Inside the same MONTH? Less than a week apart? Yes, your eyes are correct. In a short while I will disappear for a length of time undetermined. I have hit a brick wall in certain projects and I am going insane (again). That is about as much detail of my personal life I will ever release on fat-pie. I've had a post-it note on my desktop for a year or so instructing me to put certain videos on Youtube; I have finally gotten around to uploading two that may or may not have ever been seen by human eyes. I don't know for certain because these things were both made for Playboy at the same time as
     <a class="headinglink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idCFV0KF4uo">
      TIME
     </a>
     and
     <a class="headinglink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SugwO4EWjkk">
      MUSIC MOUTH
     </a>
     and the releases were supposed to be staggered. The first two popped up and then nothing happened for months. I think Playboy got tired of the idea of animation shortly after they launched the website. There was very little communication once the animation was delivered and the page was impossible to search - it didn't even show up on Google at all! Now and again I would check to see if anything was added but it didn't update very frequently, then it disappeared completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     If these were released, they can't have been on the site for more than a few weeks. So, as I am just about to leave the world I thought it'd be nice to leave you with two cartoons that you probably haven't seen. Five years on I don't think Playboy will be too mad that I am releasing them on Youtube. Consider this an overdue leak.

      The Return Of WallerFM
     </span>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Remember WallerFM? No? Well that's probably because we haven't done any WallerFM episodes since 2008 and it was never our most popular series, which is a shame because it is our absolute favourite to make.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waller FM is our only audio comedy series. Sometimes we use the word "podcast" to describe WallerFM, but to me that conjures up an image of two boring, self absorbed celebs talking slowly about their day to day lives - which WallerFM really isn't at all, so forget the word "podcast" exists (though we still will use it occasionally).
    </p>
    <p>
     If you already know what WallerFM is, then skip this and start listening, if you don't then let me sum it up: audio comedy based around the fictitious radio station WallerFM - with improvised character comedy, satire, bits of music, sketches, parody and general banter. Christian and myself have been talking nonsense and making each other laugh since about 1997, with WallerFM we finally found a way to present it to the world.
