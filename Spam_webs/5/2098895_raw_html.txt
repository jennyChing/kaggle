        <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site?CMP=share_btn_tw">
         reported
        </a>
        onthe equivalent of a CIA black site operated by police in Chicago.When computer program analyst Kory Wright opened the story, he told me, I immediately recognized the building  because, the Chicago resident says, hewaszip-tied to a bench there for hours in an intentionally overheated room without access towater or a bathroom, eventually giving false statements to try andend his ordeal.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        A friend of Wrights swept up in the samepolice raid described his own brutal treatment at the facility, known as Homan Square,includingattacks to hisface and genitals. The experiences of the two men line up with the way defense attorneys described the black site warehouse to Ackerman: as a place where detaineeswere held off the books, without access to lawyers, while being beaten or shackled forlong periods of time.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Wright claims that nine years ago, he spent at least six [brutal] hours at the Homan facility on his 21st birthday.He saysthat he was never read his Miranda rights, and that his arrest was not put into the police systemuntil after hisordeal was over.Wright was reminded of the facility again this week when he noticed a

         tweet

        from a writer he admires,
        <span class="s1">
         <i>
          The Atlantic
         </i>
         s Ta-Nehisi Coates, linking to Ackermans story. AckermancomparedHoman Square tothe network of shadowy torture centers built by the CIA across the Middle East  but focused 
        </span>
        on Americans, most often poor, black and brown, rather than on purported overseas terrorists.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Another way Homan Square differed fromCIA black siteswasthat the facilitywasnt a completely furtive enterprise. Several lawyers and anti-police brutality advocates with whom I spoke knew that suspects were routinely detained at Homan. The facility houses many of the police departments special units, including the anti-gang and anti-drug task forces, along with the evidence-retrieval unit. Oncesuspects arrived at Homan, theydidnot have to be booked immediately, at least not as far as the police department wasconcerned, according to the people with whom I spoke. In fact, it was possible that asuspects arrest reportwouldnt show that he or she had ever been to Homan. Further, police coulddetain individuals at Homan for hours, or disappear them, before shipping them off to a district station for processing.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        <span class="s1">
         The Chicago Police Department declined to address the specific allegations fromWright and his friend, providing onlya general statement denying abuses at Homan Square. (The samestatement also appears in Ackermans story.) CPD abides by all laws, rules and guidelines pertaining to any interviews of suspects or witnesses, at Homan Square or any other CPD facility, the statement read. T
        </span>
        here are always records of anyone who is arrested by CPD, and this is not any different at Homan Square.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Kory Wright disagrees.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        It was late on the hot morning ofJune 29, 2006  Kory Wrights 21st birthday when he set out for the North Lawndale residence of a relative, a short walkfrom his own. I know they got a lot of connections over there, and he said I can get my hair braided, so I came over and I was getting my hair braided, Wright says. He saysthis relativesold crack cocaine, and that his mother had warned him prior to June 29 to keep his distance, but you know, they good people.

       <p class="p1">
        As Wright was having his hair braided on the porch, a nice clean lady comes and asks to buy some drugs. According to Wright, the woman had a fifty [dollar bill]. And I exchanged the fifty. I gave her the change and then she completed her transaction with my [relative].
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        <span class="s1">
         Wright claimsthe drug-buyer was an undercover cop, and that the entire transaction was recorded by Chicago police, because two or three minutes after the drug deal, officers in plain clothes swarmed the house and detained Wright, two of his relatives, and one of his friends, Deandre Hutcherson. They searched us first and then they took us all down to that one place Im talking about, Wright says, referring to the Homan interrogation site. Wright and Hutcherson both insist the police never read them their Miranda rights.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        When we first got to that place, we went in a garage and they walked us up the stairs, he says. Phone calls to counsel and family were denied, Wright and Hutcherson say, while no fingerprints were taken, and no paperwork was filled out  which means there wasno evidence they were ever there.I tried to tell them it was my birthday, he says, and I think I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He [a Chicago police officer] got the nerve to go get his friend, and they, like, sung happy birthday. Wright believes the virulent police officers were taunting him. I see it [Homan] everyday. I shudder, saysWright, whose neighborhood was just south of the facility.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        The four men were split up and placed in small, separate rooms that were the size of office cubicles. It was a steamy summer day, and Wright was sweating profusely at Homan; he believes the police either turned the heat on, or turned the air conditioning off, to sweat him out. When we first got in there it was room-temperature, and before he [a Chicago police officer] left, he was like, Its gon get a little hot in here, saysHutcherson, now 29.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        <span class="s1">
         For six hours, a sweaty Wright sat zip-tied to a bench with no access to a restroom, a telephone or water. They strapped me  like across, kind of  to a bench, and my hands were strapped on both sides of me, he says.I cant even scratch my face. When Wright first arrived at Homan, he was left alone for a while in the hot room. Wright asked the police if he could call his mother, but instead, various police officers came in and out. They were badgering me with questions. Tell me about this murder! one officer shouted. Wright provided his interrogator with false information and names, with the hope of making it stop. He told me he was trying to get out of the situation and give them something they wanted.
        </span>
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Meanwhile, Hutcherson  also shackled to a bench  was being interrogated in another room.He [a Chicago police officer] gets up, walking toward me, Hutcherson alleges. I already know whats finna happen. I brace myself, and he hit me a little bit and then take his foot and stepped on my groin. According to Hutcherson, the officer struck him two or three times in the face before kicking hispenis.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        You must think Im a fucking idiot, Hutcherson sayshis attacker told him. Within an hour, Hutcherson, who was in town for his mothers funeral, faked an asthma attack that unnerved the police. He saysthey then released him from detention and sent him on his way.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        The descriptions that Wright and Hutcherson provided of their experiences at Homan are eerily similar to how Tracy Siska, executive director of the Chicago Justice Project, described such torture in

       <p class="p1">
        Siska has known about the goings-on at Homan since about the mid- to late-2000s. Siska also said that most of those detained at Homan are poor, black and brown people suspected of street crimes. When I asked why reporters havent covered the abuses allegedly occurring there, Siska replied with a slight chuckle, Thats the million dollar question. The problem is a lot of reporters agree with the police perspective.

       <p class="p1">
        More broadly, Wrights tale is typical of low-income, minoritized people victimized by Americas criminal justice system. Eventually, he was taken to Cook County jail, where he was processed and charged with distribution of heroin and cocaine. Given his low-income status, Wrights only option for counsel was a public defender.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Wrights lawyer, he says, was pregnant and overworked, while Wrightsuffered through multiple continuances.When his public defender gave birth, Wright was assigned a new attorney, who also, naturally, had a taxing caseload.In the end, the drug charges against Wright were thrown out, though not before hed spent six months under house arrest because his mother lacked the money to funda bond for release.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Kory Wright was attending Wilbur Wright Community College, and taking criminal justice courses, when he was detained at Homan. He sayshe had hopes of becoming a police officer in the city of Chicago before that June day. Wright told me a story about how police  when he was 16 years old  had roughed up him up, along with some friends of his. Afterwards, Wright decided he wanted to be a counterweight to that sort of police-initiated harassment, which regularly afflicts communities such as North Lawndale. But his experience at Homan, and his subsequent arrest, caused him to miss a semester of school.
       </p>
       <p class="p1">
        Fortunately, Wright recovered, and today, at age 29, he is working on his masters degree in network engineering at DePaul University. He lives in Bronzeville, a neighborhood onChicagos South Side, and is the father ofa new baby girl. But the touchless torture he says he suffered at Homan continues to haunt him. The whole thing caused a rift between me and my mom. I didnt like being black at all after that, and when I got to DePaul, I started trying to be as white as possible, a doleful Wright told me. Being black is a curse.
