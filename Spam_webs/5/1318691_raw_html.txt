website can be used to investigate topics at the local, regional, or global level. The data is displayed on the website in the 
form of dynamic timelines and entity profiles, and is exportable into XML  so it can be shared with others for non-commercial purposes.

individuals, organizations, businesses, etc. For each entity there is an entity  profile page which includes (1) information about the entity; (2) links to 
related entities; and (3) a chronology of all events in which the entity was  an active participant. Visitors can view entity profiles by searching the database, 
or by clicking on one of the entity links at the bottom of an event.

          <p>
           Anyone who registers on the website and becomes a member of a timeline project can submit content. Membership is 
free. Once a user becomes a member, s/he can edit existing event summaries by  clicking the edit link that is next to that event (the user must be logged in 
to see the edit link). In addition to editing existing events, users  can also add new ones to the database. Registered users who add content 
are called contributors. Since the project is still beta, and  since we do not have enough editors at this time, membership is restricted to 
a relatively small group of users.

          <h2>
           Who edits the content?
          </h2>
          <p>
           Any qualified individualan experienced 
contributor, professional editor, academic, journalist, graduate student, etc.can 
become a content editor. Content editors, like all users, are volunteers.  They verify the accuracy of entries submitted by contributors. Content 
editors may reject, approve, or edit and approve, submissions. After approving  an entry, the entry is then copy edited.

            <em>
             To provide a means for members of civil  society to monitor the activities of powerful entities, such as governments, 
large corporations, and wealthy and influential individuals.
            </em>
            In this capacity, 
the website should be regarded as an IT toolset that enables members of the  public to operate as a sort of peoples intelligence agency. To initiate 
an investigation of a certain issue, entity, or event, a user first creates  a timeline project. The user then becomes the project 
manager of that project and begins adding events, entities,  and relationships. The data is displayed as a chronology. Project managers 
can define an unlimited number of category sets and categories that s/he can  use to classify the events. This gives the data some structure and 
makes it more readable for visitors.

            <em>
             To increase the efficiency of information 
production.
            </em>
            This project is premised on the notion that collaboration  in a networked open-content environment can greatly improve the 
efficiency and quality of information production in the public sphere as it  allows contributors to build upon and improve the work of others in real time 
as part of a global community. This arrangement allows the production of information 
to take place at a level of efficiency comparableif not superiorto  that of the capital-intensive efforts of hierarchically structured private 
enterprises. The Center believes this improved efficiency is socially significant 
because products resulting from this system of production are inherently more  democratic than those of the private sector since they are created by a much 
broader spectrum of interests and perspectives.
           </li>
           <li>
            <em>
             To increase the efficiency of information 
acquisition.
            </em>
            Another objective of the Center is to increase the efficiency  of research by reducing the tendency for researchers to duplicate the efforts 
of others. All too often, researcherslargely because of a fragmented  historical recordneedlessly spend a significant amount of time and energy 
bringing material together and identifying relationships, even though this work  may have already been done by someone else. By collecting a mass of extensively cited 
data, this website should reduce the frequency of duplicated efforts.

            <em>
             To reduce the fragmentation of the historical 
record.
            </em>
            This project seeks to help reduce the fragmentation of the historical 
record by connecting events whose temporal and spatial relationships are often  obscured by a mass of contradicting and disconnected literature, the biases 
of the media, and the tendency for important past events to be relegated to  the annals of forgotten history. By reducing the fragmentation of the historical 
record, this project hopes to reduce the amount of time it takes for the public  to acquire a full and coherent picture of an event or issue.

           <li>
            <em>
             To create a history commons.
            </em>
            All the data in the History Commons database will be exportable into XML 
so it can be used by other individuals and groups for non-commercial purposes.  As such the historical data collected by contributors and stored in the Cooperative 
Research database will serve as a sort of commons for historical data.

          <p>
           Absolutely amazing site. Genius. The mind boggles at the amount of  work you must have put into it. - Dean Cavanagh, UK
          </p>
          <p>
           This site is so brilliant. Thank you for doing it! - Suzanne  DeBolt
          </p>
          <p>
           I'd just like to say thank you. I kept myself quite late one night  dreaming of a grand project like this, and you've done it. Brilliant. I'm 
glad there are people like yourselves out there. - Will Swanson
          </p>
          <p>
           Your organization and your Web site truly realize the potential of 
the Internet for collaborative study, research, and understanding. This is  one of the best, if not the best, resource on the Web for detailed, unbiased, 
and unfiltered analysis of recent events. - Peter Orvetti
          </p>
          <p>
            absolutely brilliant website, of great value to all! Splendid 
work. - Nigel
          </p>
          <p>
           I just want to let all of you know what an absolutely amazing website 
History Commons is. It has been the most informative site I have  come across and I tell EVERYONE about it. I can not even begin to imagine 
the time and effort put into making this site what it is, and it amazes me  how much it has grown over the past year (after finding it while doing research 
for an English paper for college.) Keep up the outstanding work, I can  speak for many people when I say it is appreciated and making a difference. 
- Amanda Rae
          </p>
          <p>
           You've done a yeoman's job and your research is important history. 
Really important. REALLY important.  You are verifying sources and  events in a way that none of the majors have done, and which The Grey Lady 
(NYT) heretofore prides itself as the sole source of. Your work puts the NYT  to shame. - Janie Angus
          </p>
          <p>
           yours is the very best site I have found.And you  gave me hope when it was hard to come by. - KathrynWelch, Blacksburg, 
VA
          </p>
          <p>
           I consider your project as one of the most important web-based projects 
aimed at combating what I call political amnesia. - Morten Nielsen
          </p>
          <p>
           I have to tell you that your information is devastating in its completeness 
and I have already in about the first 15 minutes of reading the time line  learned about Joe T. I didn't know a damn thing about this character and the 
role he played in the propaganda of wmd. In short I want to applaud all that  you've created . - Debs Bleicher
          </p>
          <p>
           Your site is an incomparable resource tool on an important array  of contemporary US policies. It is unique, irreplaceable, and of inestimable 
value. - Michael B. Green, Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist, Qualified  Medical Examiner, Former Professor of Philosophy UT Austin.
          </p>

           ... reports prepared by [the History Commons] team were helpful in my work as 
a freelance political writer. I am an author of two published books and hundreds  of articles in the best of Polish language political magazines. - Henryk 
A. Kowalczyk
          </p>
          <p>
           I spend most of all of my available time researching material from 
the [History Commons website]. ... I have found that the detailed  and accurate information from the [website] can allow 
a user to build a comprehensive overview of things. There are no quick sensational 
propaganda write-ups, such as found on some ... websites. The [website] is a long hard slog to the real truth. - Malcolm 
Bush
