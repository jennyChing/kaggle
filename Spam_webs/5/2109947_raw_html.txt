         Not too long ago, I met a gentleman who showed me a scar on one side of his head where, years earlier, a woman wearing brass knuckles had split his temple open. Then he showed me the scar on the other side of his head where a man had subsequently hit him with a pistol butt because he refused to reveal who had hit him with the brass knuckles. There was more to his story, but basically it boiled down to this: Avoid South Carolina at all costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was selling magazine subscriptions door to door, and he was good at it. He said he had two brothers in prison; that hed done seven years and ten months himself. And that if I bought a magazine subscription from him hed be less likely to end up there again. Who knows if any of it was true; he may have figured me for a reformer and do-gooder and decided to lean heavily on the reformed felon angle. I bought into it to the extent of a two-year subscription to
         <em>
          Black Belt
         </em>
         magazine (something I will never live down at the dojo if the magazine ever does arrive in my mailbox). I have no idea if the outfit he was working for was legitimate, but the scars on his head were real enough.
        </p>
        <p>
         I bought the subscription in part because the salesman told fascinating stories, and also just to help him stay the hell out of South Carolina, but mainly because it was clear that hed been in some serious fights, this guy. I dont want to give the impression that I admire the habitually violent (though Ill admit to a certain sense of fellow feeling). In fact, if you have a history of constantly getting into fights, I think it kind of indicates youre not dealing with some important issues in your life. But I have noticed something about people whove been in a few real fights, whove been injured and fought back: They tend not to see violence as a ready solution to problems. Theyve tried it, or had it tried on them, and they know its costs and its limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think thats a really valuable perspective for a person to have.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, people with this perspective are much more likely to end up selling magazines door-to-door rather than, say, determining our nations foreign policy. They rarely govern states or run for President, or write editorial columns for the
         <em>
          New York Times
         </em>
         or the Washington Post, or get interviewed by Charlie Rose. Which is a shame, because it means that the people who do make policy and write editorials and get interviewed on national television tend to skew heavily toward the perspective that violence is easy, cheap, morally defensible, and loads of fun.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus we get policy makers like former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (did you know he has a new book out?), a peacetime Navy flight instructor who overruled the generals planning the invasion of Iraq, and insisted that the conflict there would be over in days or weeks. We get pundits like Tom Friedman and Richard Cohen, who thought invading Iraq was just a swell idea; that the repercussions from Shock and Awe would be candy and flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
         And we get presidents like George W. Bush, who tossed off pithy wartime quips like, Bring em on! and Wanted: Dead or alive, delighting cable news producers and killing God only knows how many Americans, Afghans, Iraqis, and other human beings.
        </p>
        <p>
         We talk about violence an awful lot. One thing Ive learned over the years is that the people who talk about it the most, the loudest, and with the greatest relish, usually have the least real experience with it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Theres a famous unsavory story from back in the extended adolescence of George W., when the young rake, after a night of drinking with his 16-year-old brother, challenged his father to a fight, 
         <em>
          mano a mano
         </em>
         . This means, literally, hand-to-hand, though I suspect, given Bushs rather primitive grasp of Spanish and of language in general, he may have thought it meant man-to-man.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whatever he thought he was saying, young George was spoiling for a fight. And I wonder how different our countrys recent history would be if his father, George H. W. Bush, had actually stepped up that night and belted the prodigal son. Not that Im advocating familial violence; I dont think fathers should hit their sons, even when the son is 26 years old and becoming an embarrassment on the world stage. Then too, hitting people doesnt sound like the kind of thing George, Sr. would do, World War II veteran though he is.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, I can imagine his wife doing itand quite capably, too. In fact I can imagine Barbara Bush comfortably handling any number of unpleasant tasks, from slaughtering bullocks to building a long and successful career as a prison matron. Even without brass knuckles, shed be a formidable opponent, and in my opinion, George W. showed rare good judgment in not challenging his mother to go
         <em>
          mano a mano
         </em>
         that day.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anyway, this ugly scene was supposedly the final straw for the Bushes, who promptly bundled George, Jr. off to Harvard Business School. Which is, I must admit, a creative nonviolent response to the situation, though not one that most people can afford to emulate. The upshot was that George the Lesser didnt get thrashed that day, and maybe thats why, thirty years later, his thwarted machismo led America into two of the longest wars in our history.
        </p>
        <p>
         Id been voting against Bush for years before he became the rest of the nations problem but even I was surprised by the simplistic, romanticized understanding of violence he demonstrated after 9/11. Ive long suspected that, for all his swagger and pugnacious, bristling nastiness, George W. Bush himself would, upon receiving a single stiff punch to the gut, curl up in the floor and cry like a tiny baby.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that Ill probably never get a chance to test this theory saddens me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bush had been spoiling for a fight his whole life, and I suppose now he thinks hes been in one. Ive never been in a real fighta fight where my life was at stakeand Im well aware of that. Ive never (to date) had my head split open with a pistol butt or brass knuckles; Ive never been shot at. Ive mostly fought under very controlled conditions. But at least when I did that, they were my fights. No stand-ins, no proxies, no armies. I took my own damage, and I have the hospital bills to prove it. Ive hit a lot of people; pretty much all of them hit me back. And thats an important point that you might not appreciate if you havent ever experienced combat.
        </p>
        <p>
         Say youre angry at someone. Maybe its something theyve done or said, or maybe its really not about them at all. Maybe they just happen to be handy. Whatever the reason, you strike this person. Hardas hard as you can (or else why, for heavens sake, are you hitting them at all?). And as you strike, your anger, your fear, your outraged sense of justiceit all surges through your hand like an electric current, and you feel this magical spark. You feel that for once, all of that emotion has gone precisely where it was meant to, and you put it there. For one brief instant, the universe is a balanced place, and it all makes sense.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ahh, says your amygdala.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pretty nice so far, isnt it? But heres what you have to remember: The phrase is mano a mano. There are two hands doing the fighting. And one of them is not yours.
        </p>
        <p>
         After the attacks of 9/11, everyone was angry, and looking for someone to hit. Bluster and threats became patriotic. And once we all agreed that fighting didnt really mean hitting and getting hit, but rather was something scripted, proclaimed, and displayedhell, under those terms,
         <em>
          anyone
         </em>
         could be a hero. Even a seedy carnival barker like Glenn Beck, or a pasty white lump like Bill Kristol, or a visibly rusting David Broder, could call for war and feel virile and warlike without ever hearing the whine of a bullet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ken Adelman could write in the
         <em>

         that demolishing Husseins military power and liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk. Richard Cohen, also in the
         <em>
          Post
         </em>
         , could assure us that the prudent use of violence could be therapeutic. Tom Friedman could go on Charlie Roses show and tell Iraq to Suck. On. This.

         Ahh, says the amygdala.
        </p>
        <p>
         If youve never been in the middle of a fight, its easy to lose sight of what happens
         <em>
          after
         </em>
         you take your shot. In real life the other guy always gets a shot. Always. Sometimes more than one. And the question is, what will that be like for you? How will it feel, the fist or the knife or the bullet, when it smashes into your face and your life? Do you have any idea, really? If you havent been through it, I can guarantee that it wont be at all like what you expect. It may not kill you, but it will change you in ways you simply cant anticipate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Which is why I reserve a special distrust for people who advocate violent solutions from their safe perches at think tanks and editorial boards and radio syndicates. Rush Limbaugh thinks we should assassinate Julian Assange. David Broder wants us to bomb Iran. John Bolton thinks we should go after North Korea. Big, bold ideas from men who would probably, if punched in the gut, curl up on the floor and cry like tiny babies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Look, Im not saying that getting beaten up somehow, in itself, makes you a wiser and better person. All fighting experience really means, in practical terms, is that your vision tends to blur at inopportune moments and the bones in your hands ache every time it rains. But on another level, it means that at least youve personally absorbed the cost of violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Language is cheap, but the real currency of violence is extremely dear, and if all your experience with it consists of writing checks on someone elses bank account, youll always misjudge the price. To understand the real cost of violence you have to pay from your own pocket. You have to knownot in some abstract way, but concretelywhat the other hand can do to you. That knowledge is invaluable for anyone; it surely ought to be more common among our opinion-makers and policy gurus.
        </p>
        <p>
         So Im thinking about organizing my own fundraising effort, with its own crew of reformed felons going door-to-door, collecting money for a worthwhile cause. Itll benefit a truly deserving bunch of people: Tom Friedman, and Richard Cohen, and Bill Kristol, and as many other public supporters of violence as we can round up. And what well do is, well put them all on a bus, and send them to South Carolina.
        </p>
        <p>
         Im convinced this will be a great experience for them. They can meet new people and learn the local customs, and if they collect a few interesting scars in the process, well, it will give them something to talk about on Charlie Roses show.
        </p>
        <p>
         Im no fan of David Broder but if he showed me where hed been busted open by a set of brass knuckles, I would happily buy a magazine subscription from him.
