Whether or not the man is actually someone's dad is not verified, but his moves are probably the sweetest steps you've ever seen at a rock concert  and he's having way more fun than the people standing around in front. Please teach us your ways, dancing man.

Whether or not the man is actually someone's dad is not verified, but his moves are probably the sweetest steps you've ever seen at a rock concert  and he's having way more fun than the people standing around in front. Please teach us your ways, dancing man.

Lee then handed his mic to Chris Hardwick, and attempted to exit the stage But when Tatum noticed Lee was having some trouble, he jumped into action like a true superhero,

          Any useful technology that's successfully adopted by a culture won't be abandoned. Ever. (Except by top-down force). The technology might be replaced by a better alternative, but society doesn't go backwards. After books were accepted, few went back to scrolls. After air conditioning is installed, it's never uninstalled. Vinyl records, straight razors and soon, drivable cars, will all be perceived as hobbies, not mainstream activities. This one-way ratchet is accelerating and it's having a profound effect on every culture we are part of. As Kevin Kelly has pointed out, technology creates more

          When we hit an obstacle, sometimes the best we can hope for is to bounce back. To recover, to get through this and get back to normal. But when our project hits a snag, perhaps we can consider using the moment to bounce forward instead. Being on the alert for opportunities, not merely repairs. If we're spending our time and effort focusing on a return to normal, sometimes we miss the opportunity that's right in front of us. Bouncing forward means an even better path, not merely the one we were on in the first place.

          The brilliant decision in making the new Star Wars ComicCon reel was this: J.J. Abrams could have chosen to wow the audience with special effects, to show a little more, to try to pique interest by satisfying the tension felt by the true fans who don't know what's coming, and can't stand not knowing. Instead, of following the conventional wisdom and showing, he told. He told a story of care, of excitement, of anticipation. He created tension instead of relieving it. This takes resolve and guts. Most of the time, we want to blurt out the answer. But the thing is, people rarely get

          If you can say this out loud, when you've been holding back, avoiding your confrontation with the truth, you will free yourself to do something important. Saying it takes away the power of the fear. On the other hand, if you say it 8 times or 11 times or every time, you're using the label to reinforce your fear, creating an easy escape hatch to avoid doing something important. Saying it amplifies the fear. The brave thing is to find the unspeakable fear and speak it. And to stop rehearsing the easy fears that have become habits.

"Well," she said, "it has feathers." I was getting a parrot. What could be cooler than a parrot? Alas, I got a down blanket. Can't win them all. Today's my 55th, and it would be great if you wouldn't send me a gift, a card or even an email. Not because I have birthday issues, but because I think we might be able to plant the seed for a very significant culture change, something bigger than a bike. Is it possible for your birthday to

          Lets kick off this new week of 31 Days to Build a Better Blog with a podcast about finding your tribe. Im an introvert, and blogging and podcasting work really well with my personality type. I enjoy interacting with others, but at a bit of a distance. But one of the biggest lessons Ive learned over 13 years in this business is that sometimes I have to push myself out of my comfort zone and be among people, because its then that my blogs grow best. In my first few weeks of blogging when I had no idea what I was doing, I realised the value of having a helping hand in

Although this week weve covered social media, forums and groups, alerts, brainstorming, editorial calendars and even getting off your blog to find inspiration, we havent talked much about the static pages on your blog. And that is what todays episode is all about! Often these pages get left behind in the day-to-day grind of churning out fresh content. But think  how long has it been since they were updated? Are they full of old information? Do you have

          Todays challenge in our 31 days to build a better blog podcast series is a bit different, and hopefully  a lot of fun. Its to not blog at all! Today I want you to leave your electronics behind and go to your local mall or shopping centre. Why? Because it will put you out in the real world where real experiences will help give you real content. It will also ensure you brush your hair for the day! In this episode Ill go into detail about what happens when I do this, and why I now recommend it to everyone. I also outline the things Ive learned and how

          So yesterday your 31DBBB Challenge was to brainstorm 10 posts for your blog (you could come up with more, but 10 was the minimum!) and today we will be building on that  developing an editorial calendar. This is going to serve as the next week of content on your blog. Ultimately these two exercises will get you on the road to setting up a publication schedule you can carry on, specifying what kind of content youll publish on what days. If you already have an editorial calendar, I recommend you use this day to review it  how has it been working? Check in your stats to see

          Blogs cant exist without content, and it is often one of the most stressful parts of blogging. Coming up with fresh, interesting, new content repeatedly for weeks, months, and years on end can take its toll if you dont put strategies in place to help you before you get to burnout point. Todays challenge in our 31 day challenge is about alleviating some of that constant pressure (that you often dont think about until its time to write) to allow you to just get on with creating content. Brainstorming ahead of time removes at least one of the obstacles to a

          Chevron has kicked off an Apple Pay pilot program in the Bay Area that allows customers to use Apple Pay to pay for their gasoline directly at the pump, according to the company's Twitter account. Apple Pay can currently be used at a Chevron location in San Ramon, with a second location in Cupertino becoming available in the near future. @kevinkeitai 18060 San Ramon Valley Blvd in San Ramon accepts NFC including Apple Pay at the dispenser now.

          Ahead of the launch of Apple Music, Taylor Swift made headlines when she wrote a scathing open letter to Apple, criticizing its decision not to pay artists for their work during its three-month free trial. Her letter, combined with pushback from indie labels, led Apple to reverse course and opt to pay artists during the three months that customers can listen for free. Record label exec Scott Borchetta, who serves as the head of Big Machine Records and signed Swift when she was 14, recently spoke at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference and shared some backstory on the negotiations that

          Apple is cautious with its Apple Watch and doesn't market the device as waterproof, instead giving it a water resistance rating of IPX7. Apple says it's fine to wear the watch in the rain or while washing your hands, but the company doesn't recommend submerging the device. Many Apple Watch owners have tested Apple's water resistance claims, coming to the conclusion that the Apple Watch is more water resistant than Apple claims. It's survived submersion in a bucket, laps in a pool, lengthy swim tests, and even a 10m dive with no damage. Image via Craig Hockenberry iOS developer Craig

As part of this, Ive encouraged Harold to do as much of the planning and deciding as possible. Harold chose the Aloft hotel chain. Swell by me. He picked it because he loved the videos.

          Web readers are people on a mission. Cramped for attention. Bent on skimming rather than diving deep. They dont go to the web to window shop. They go there to drive 60 miles per hour  and look at billboards. Thats the unbreakable rule of the web. So what can you do as a web writer to not only catch their attention, but also give them what they want in less time than it takes to finish reading this sentence? Easy. Just use the inverted pyramid  its an age-old journalistic technique. And the web writers best friend. Some think its worthless. Others alter it.

          Heres the thing: nobody can deny that there is more content out there than ever before. But I dont think the challenge this creates for content marketers is any more unique than 60 years ago or 600 years ago. In the face of so much content, yes, we are shocked  but after the shock wears off, we adapt. Because we are really freaking excited about the possibilities. And because we, as readers, can develop skills that allow us to navigate through this world without getting swallowed alive, its only natural that we, as content marketers, can too. By

          Using and writing about vintage technology, I am often reminded that much of the business of using a computer is meta, that much of what we do with computers arent the creative tasks we buy them for, but rather theyre metatasks, menial chores we do for and to the computer so it lets us do the fun and productive stuff. I am reminded of this because I find Ive forgotten how to do the damned things.The skills we acquire in the process of ministering to these machines may be vital at the time, but they fade from our repertoire as technology itself changes.

          TiVo has turned on AirPlay mirroring support in its iOS app, letting some users watch their DVR content on an Apple TV.This is actually the first time TiVo has supported streaming DVR shows to a third-party TV set-top box. Previously, users needed a $150 TiVo Mini to watch their recordings on additional televisions beyond the one where the TiVo is set up. For iPhone owners, Apple TV is a much cheaper solution at $69.Still, TiVos reliance on AirPlay mirroring isnt ideal. With mirroring, the iOS device simply duplicates its display on the big screen. That means users cannot exit the app

          Mozilla isnt taking any chances after the discovery that Hacking Team, the recently breached surveillance software maker, had three working exploits for Adobe Flash. The open source organization decided to block all versions of the Flash Player plugin up to version 18.0.0.203 on Windows. Mozilla said Flash would remain on the Firefox blocklist until Adobe fixes all known vulnerabilities.Since that decision was made, however, Adobe appears to have updated its Flash player to version .209, which is not blocked. Adobe had previously said it would fix all known vulnerabilities later this week;

Each item should span a third of the content area, with the fourth item starting on a new row, much like floats. However, a particular item must always display the price at the end of the first row. So if there are only two elements, the price element would be second. But if there are more than three items, the price would be the last element in the first row.

          Photographing people is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding parts of photography. Besides the great photos that you can acquire, for me it also means building a connection with a country and its many different kinds of people. Taking portraits of people means you need to get up close, and sometimes communicate with them, so you need to get over your shyness. Whether its a smile and pointing to your camera, or simply getting by with limited language, its incredible how receptive people are when you put in the effort. Here are some simple tips once youre ready to start

          The great thing about night photography is that subjects that appear commonplace during the day take on a new, interesting appearance at night. Urban scenesare lit (or not lit) at night in fundamentally different ways that our eyes are not used to. The long exposure times required in night photography allow you to use different techniques to capture the scenes in creative and often dramatic ways. Plus you arent beholden to the suns rays and the changing daytime light. Nevertheless, you maystruggle with finding good subjects when you do have opportunities to get out and shoot

But when were tweaking a black and white image, what we might want (well, I always want), is to see a before image of the default black and white versus our tweaks, not jumping all the way back to the color image, which is kinda

I have noticed that the slider is much more effective (no pun intended) on images still in RAW format, versus those in JPEG (I did a comparison on the same file in RAW vs an exported JPEG and its a pretty wide difference). So, keep this up your sleeve for the Independence Day post-processing. Hope

          Irish software development studio Probendi is suing Apple in a Milan court for using its "iWatch" trademark in Europe as part of a Google AdWords campaign, reports Bloomberg.

          Pixelmator for the iPhone and iPad was today updated to version 2.0.2, adding the first major new features since the app expanded to the iPhone in May. The 2.0.2 update brings Dynamic Touch, a new feature for all of the app's Retouch tools. With Dynamic Touch, users can adjust the stroke size of Retouch tools without needing to open up the brush settings menu for faster image corrections. Dynamic Touch detects the surface area of the finger that's in contact with the screen and changes the brush size accordingly. If you paint with just the tip of your finger, the brush will be thinner, while

Facebook, however, is working on bringing virtual personal assistants to its Messenger app and the web, according to The Information. Facebook's offering, which is codenamed "Moneypenny" after the assistantcharacter in the James Bond franchise, will allow users to ask real people for help to research and purchase products and services. Moneypenny will be able to help users with other tasks, but it's unclear what those tasks could be.
