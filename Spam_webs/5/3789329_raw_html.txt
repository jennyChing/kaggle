       Srinivasa Ramanujan
      </b>
      was one of India's greatest mathematical geniuses. He made substantial contributions to the analytical theory of numbers and worked on

      , and infinite series.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Ramanujan was born in his grandmother's house in Erode, a small village about 400 km southwest of Madras. When Ramanujan was a year old his mother took him to the town of Kumbakonam, about 160 km nearer Madras. His father worked in Kumbakonam as a clerk in a cloth merchant's shop. In December 1889 he contracted smallpox.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      When he was nearly five years old, Ramanujan entered the primary school in Kumbakonam although he would attend several different primary schools before entering the Town High School in Kumbakonam in January 1898. At the Town High School, Ramanujan was to do well in all his school subjects and showed himself an able all round scholar. In 1900 he began to work on his own on mathematics summing geometric and arithmetic series.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Ramanujan was shown how to solve

       <font color="green">
        cubic equations
       </font>
      </a>
      in 1902 and he went on to find his own method to solve the
      <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/quartic_equation',350,200)">
       <font color="green">
        quartic
       </font>
      </a>
      . The following year, not knowing that the
      <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/quintic_equation',350,200)">
       <font color="green">
        quintic

       <font color="green">

       </font>
      </a>
      , he tried (and of course failed) to solve the quintic.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      It was in the Town High School that Ramanujan came across a mathematics book by G S Carr called
      <i>
       Synopsis of elementary results in pure mathematics.
      </i>
      This book, with its very concise style, allowed Ramanujan to teach himself mathematics, but the style of the book was to have a rather unfortunate effect on the way Ramanujan was later to write down mathematics since it provided the only model that he had of written mathematical arguments. The book contained theorems, formulae and short proofs. It also contained an index to papers on pure mathematics which had been published in the European Journals of Learned Societies during the first half of the 19
      <sup>
       th
      </sup>
      century. The book, published in 1856, was of course well out of date by the time Ramanujan used it.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      By 1904 Ramanujan had begun to undertake deep research. He investigated the series

       <font color="green">
        Bernoulli numbers
       </font>
      </a>
      , although this was entirely his own independent discovery.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Ramanujan, on the strength of his good school work, was given a scholarship to the Government College in Kumbakonam which he entered in 1904. However the following year his scholarship was not renewed because Ramanujan devoted more and more of his time to mathematics and neglected his other subjects. Without money he was soon in difficulties and, without telling his parents, he ran away to the town of Vizagapatnam about 650 km north of Madras. He continued his mathematical work, however, and at this time he worked on
      <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/hypergeometric_function',350,200)">
       <font color="green">
        hypergeometric series
       </font>
      </a>
      and investigated relations between integrals and series. He was to discover later that he had been studying elliptic functions.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      In 1906 Ramanujan went to Madras where he entered Pachaiyappa's College. His aim was to pass the First Arts examination which would allow him to be admitted to the University of Madras. He attended lectures at Pachaiyappa's College but became ill after three months study. He took the First Arts examination after having left the course. He passed in mathematics but failed all his other subjects and therefore failed the examination. This meant that he could not enter the University of Madras. In the following years he worked on mathematics developing his own ideas without any help and without any real idea of the then current research topics other than that provided by Carr's book.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Continuing his mathematical work Ramanujan studied continued fractions and divergent series in 1908. At this stage he became seriously ill again and underwent an operation in April 1909 after which he took him some considerable time to recover. He married on 14 July 1909 when his mother arranged for him to marry a ten year old girl S Janaki Ammal. Ramanujan did not live with his wife, however, until she was twelve years old.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Ramanujan continued to develop his mathematical ideas and began to pose problems and solve problems in the
      <i>
       Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.
      </i>
      He devoloped relations between elliptic modular equations in 1910. After publication of a brilliant research paper on Bernoulli numbers in 1911 in the
      <i>
       Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society
      </i>
      he gained recognition for his work. Despite his lack of a university education, he was becoming well known in the Madras area as a mathematical genius.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      In 1911 Ramanujan approached the founder of the

       <font color="brown">

      for advice on a job. After this he was appointed to his first job, a temporary post in the Accountant General's Office in Madras. It was then suggested that he approach Ramachandra Rao who was a Collector at Nellore. Ramachandra Rao was a founder member of the

     <p align="justify">
      Ramachandra Rao told him to return to Madras and he tried, unsuccessfully, to arrange a scholarship for Ramanujan. In 1912 Ramanujan applied for the post of clerk in the accounts section of the Madras Port Trust. In his letter of application he wrote [

      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p align="justify">
      Despite the fact that he had no university education, Ramanujan was clearly well known to the university mathematicians in Madras for, with his letter of application, Ramanujan included a reference from E W Middlemast who was the Professor of Mathematics at The Presidency College in Madras. Middlemast, a graduate of St John's College, Cambridge, wrote [

      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p align="justify">
      On the strength of the recommendation Ramanujan was appointed to the post of clerk and began his duties on 1 March 1912. Ramanujan was quite lucky to have a number of people working round him with a training in mathematics. In fact the Chief Accountant for the Madras Port Trust, S N Aiyar, was trained as a mathematician and published a paper
      <i>
       On the distribution of primes
      </i>
      in 1913 on Ramanujan's work. The professor of civil engineering at the Madras Engineering College C L T Griffith was also interested in Ramanujan's abilities and, having been educated at University College London, knew the professor of mathematics there, namely M J M Hill. He wrote to Hill on 12 November 1912 sending some of Ramanujan's work and a copy of his 1911 paper on Bernoulli numbers.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Hill replied in a fairly encouraging way but showed that he had failed to understand Ramanujan's results on divergent series. The recommendation to Ramanujan that he read

       Hardy

      brought Ramanujan to Trinity College, Cambridge, to begin an extraordinary collaboration. Setting this up was not an easy matter. Ramanujan was an orthodox Brahmin and so was a strict vegetarian. His religion should have prevented him from travelling but this difficulty was overcome, partly by the work of E H Neville who was a colleague of

     <p align="justify">
      Ramanujan sailed from India on 17 March 1914. It was a calm voyage except for three days on which Ramanujan was seasick. He arrived in London on 14 April 1914 and was met by Neville. After four days in London they went to Cambridge and Ramanujan spent a couple of weeks in Neville's home before moving into rooms in Trinity College on 30

Even in his first winter in England, Ramanujan was ill and he wrote in March 1915 that he had been ill due to the winter weather and had not been able to publish anything for five months. What he did publish was the work he did in England, the decision having been made that the results he had obtained while in India, many of which he had communicated to
