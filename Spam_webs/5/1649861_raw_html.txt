         McQuillan walked into a bar and ordered martini after martini,
 each time 
 removing the olives and placing them in a jar.
 When the jar was filled 
 with olives and all the drinks consumed, he started to leave.

 done. 'What was that all about?'

            Barty was trapped in a bog and seemed a goner when
Big Mick O'Reilly wandered by.

            Don't worry,' assured Mick. 'Next to the Strong Muldoon, Oi'm the strongest
man in Erin, and Oi'll pull ye right out o' there.'
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Mick leaned out and grabbed Barty's hand and pulled and pulled to no avail.

            <br/>
            After two more unsuccessful attempts, Mick said to Barty, 'Shure, an' Oi 
can't do it. The Strong Muldoon could do it alone, mebbe,
but Oi'll have to get some help.'

            Jimy-Joe went to a pet shop and asked how many budgies were in stock. 'We 
have 99' replied the shop owner 'Give us the lot' said the Jimmy-Joe, paid 
for them and left. He went to a tailors shop and had 99 pockets sewn into a 
jacket, put a budgie in each pocket, went up to the Post Office Tower and 
jumped off.

            It was Paddy and Seamus giving the motorcycle a ride on a brisk autumn
day.  After a wee bit, Paddy who was sitt'n behind Seamus on the bike 
began to holler ...'Seamus ... Seamus ... the wind is cutt'n me chest 
out!'
            <br/>
            <br/>
            'Well, Paddy my lad,' said Seamus, 'why don't you take your jacket off
and turn it from front to back ... that'll block the wind for you.'
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So Paddy took Seamus' advice and turned his jacket from front to back 
and got back on the bike and the two of them were off down the road 
again.  After a bit, Seamus turned to talk to Paddy and was horrified to 
see that Paddy was not there.  Seamus immediately turned the bike around 
and retraced their route.  When after a short time he came to a turn and 
saw a bunch of farmers standing around Paddy who was sitting on the 
ground.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            'T'anks be to heaven, is he alright?'  Seamus hailed to the farmers.
            <br/>
            'Well,' said one of the farmers, ' he was alright when we found him here 
.. but since we turned his head back to front .. he hasn't said a word 
since!'

            As soon as she had finished parochial school,
a bright young girl named Lena shook the dust of Ireland off her shoes
and made her way to New York where before long, she became a successful performer
in show business.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Eventually she returned to her home town for a visit and on a Saturday night
went to confession in the church which she had always attended as a child.
In the confessional Father Sullivan recognized her and began asking her about her
work. She explained that she was an acrobatic dancer, and he wanted to know what that meant.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She said she would be happy 
to show him the kind of thing she did on stage.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She stepped out of the confessional and within sight of Father Sullivan,
she went into a series of cartwheels, leaping splits, handsprings and backflips.
Kneeling near the confessional, waiting their turn, were two middle-aged ladies.
They witnessed Lena's acrobatics with wide eyes, and one said to the other:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            'Will you just look at the penance Father Sullivan is givin' out this night,

            Scorcher Murphy was selling his house, and put the matter in an agent's hands.
The agent wrote up a sales blurb for the house that made wonderful reading.
After Murphy read it, he turned to the agent and asked,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            'Have I got all ye say there?'

            'Well, Mrs. O'Connor, so you want a divorce?' the solicitor questioned his client.
            <br/>
