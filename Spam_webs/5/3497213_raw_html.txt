                                  Equine Legal Solutions clients have found that taking these

                                  landlord/tenant relationships, are governed
                                  solely by the agreement between the parties

                     </span>
                     Most states have laws that give
                                  boarding stables a lien on horses for past
                                  due board.
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
                     </span>
                     However, those laws typically require
                                  you to follow a specific process before you
                                  can sell a horse to satisfy the debt, and
                                  the process is usually time-consuming and
                                  expensive.
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
                     </span>
                     For example, state livestock lien laws
                                  often require you to get a court order, which
                                  means that you would have to sue the owner and
                                  obtain a judgment against them before you
                                  could sell the horse.
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
                     </span>
                     This problem is often compounded by the
                                  fact that you cannot find the owner and/or the
                                  horse does not have much market value.
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
                     </span>
                     Meanwhile, you are continuing to feed
                                  and clean up after this horse.
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

                     What can you do to protect yourself
                                  from this type of situation?
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
                     </span>
                     The answer is fairly simple  your
                                  boarding contract can provide you with more
                                  rights than you would otherwise have under
                                  your states livestock lien laws.
