           QUIRUVILCA, PERUTowering atop a pedestal in the main square, a golden statue of a miner with his headlamp and jackhammer gleams in the morning sun, a monument to the mineral wealth on which this town was built.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The Quiruvilca mine opened almost 100 years ago, and its blackened wooden structures still loom on the mountainside above the rooftops. But a century of mining copper, silver, zinc and gold brought little development to this remote settlement, nestled in a steep valley more than 4,000 metres up in the Peruvian Andes. The roads werent paved; many people didnt have electricity.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Nine years ago, another mine opened, operated by Toronto-based
           <a href="http://www.barrick.com/">
            Barrick Gold
           </a>
           , the worlds biggest gold mining company. It has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and royalties and the new-found wealth is visible everywhere. The local government has brought power to virtually everyone in town and is now hooking up remote villages. Through an infrastructure-for-taxes program, Barrick has constructed roads, a police college, a hospital and a school. A new highway has cut travel time to the coast from eight hours to 3.5.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But physical infrastructure is the low-hanging fruit of development. While everyone benefits from the new highway, not everyone can get work at the mine; unemployment and poverty remain endemic.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           I have to recognize that economically, (Barrick is) here and they allowed us to do projects. They allowed us to bring electricity to many communities, Mayor Walter Diaz Ramos says. But the job opportunities, which are a direct benefit to the families, theyre insufficient.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Making the jump from roads to jobs has proven difficult, and prompted people here to ask whether mining can bring lasting prosperity.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           In an effort to prove that Canadian mining companies can bring more than just a few jobs to the countries where they dig, the Canadian government has launched a series of international development pilot projects in mining communities. In Quiruvilca, it has funded a partnership between the charity
           <a href="http://www.worldvision.ca/">
            World Vision
           </a>
           and Barrick to develop the economy, but the small-scale jobs created  micro-entrepreneurs, theyre called  fall short of the economic activity needed to sustain the town long term.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The curse of the boom town remains on everyones mind. As Ramos said: Without mining, we wouldnt exist.

           It has been four years since Cirilo Paredes worked in the shafts, but he still looks like a miner.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           He spent 22 years as a tunnel builder and his deep-set eyes and creased skin testify to a life of hardships underground: long shifts in tight quarters with little light for low pay.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           When he couldnt take it anymore, he quit and passed his job to his son. There has never been much to do in mining towns other than mine. But as Paredes removes his cap to wipe sweat from his brow, he glances toward the sky filled with brilliant sunshine and says: You know, I dont mind physical labour at all, but its so much better out here in the open.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Paredes is the proud owner of Quiruvilcas first coal-delivery business. On a crisp and chilly day, he swung his shovel atop a giant pile of coal, mixing it with clay and forming it into balls to deliver to more than 200 households for heating and cooking. He makes more than he did as a miner and provides a service that benefits the community.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Paredes started the business after attending entrepreneurial workshops sponsored by World Vision and Barrick. His business plan won a local government competition that paid for three half-ton delivery motorbikes, which have allowed him to expand the company and hire three employees.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           With $500,000 from Barrick and another $500,000 from the Canadian government, World Vision launched the business workshops as a way to wean the town off total dependence on the mines. As the project winds down its third year, it can lay claim to a dozen successful small businesses in this town of 7,500, as well as a dozen more in the small villages nestled in the surrounding mountain valleys. From cheese factories to alpaca wool co-operatives, local restaurants to ice-cream vendors and even a doll manufacturer, the project has spawned a slew of micro-businesses.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Early successes like Paredess are promising, but the projects real victory is having unlocked the Peruvian governments own money for projects that will benefit local people. When the project started in 2010, the regional government spent just over $900,000 on five community development projects, said Onome Ako, the business development manager at World Vision. By 2012, those numbers had exploded: 21 projects were funded with $4.9 million. Most tellingly, without any help from World Vision, that momentum was sustained in 2013, when 19 community projects received $4.2 million.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           By spending $1 million, weve unlocked $9 million in government funds, Ako said. Were helping to ensure the resources are being used for the benefit of the local people. This empowers locals to hold government to account. Even if we walked away right now, weve already seen in the last two years that theres been an increase in locally driven projects.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The program is built on an innovative tax scheme that was already in place to fight corruption. Called the 
           <i>
            Canon
           </i>
           , it puts half of a mines income tax in a fund earmarked for the region around the mine. The money is only released when the local government can present properly planned and budgeted projects. While this is an effective way to prevent local politicians from buying fancy cars or feeding inflated contracts to friends, it has had the effect of making it hard for regional governments to spend their own money.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           World Vision estimates that in 2009, before the project started, the Quiruvilca government was spending less that half of the approximately $20 million it was receiving in Canon per year  the vast majority of it on infrastructure projects. In 2013, after three years of project proposal training with World Vision, the local government spent 60 per cent of its Canon, and funded four times as many economic development projects as before.

           Peru, like many Latin American nations, is a place of extreme contrasts. There is the Amazon jungle in the east and tropical beaches in the west, with the snow-capped peaks of the Andes dividing the two. Across this diverse landscape, the wealthy generally occupy the coastal lowlands, while the indigenous and poor live at altitude or tucked into the jungle. But the fate of both rich and poor are linked to the mining industry.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Peru has long been Latin Americas largest gold producer and remains overwhelmingly dependent on extraction. The
           <a href="https://eiti.org/">
            Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
           </a>
           reports that mining and petroleum make up 62 per cent of Perus exports and account for more than 75 per cent of foreign investment. But it hasnt always been this way. Pulling oil and minerals out of the ground in Peru is a business that has ridden waves of nationalization and denationalization over the decades.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The floodgates for foreign investment most recently reopened in the 1990s after then-President Alberto Fujimori defeated the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who had controlled most of the countrys mineral-rich mountains. The results of this victory have been enormous: mining concessions in the previously unsafe mountains increased more than tenfold and now cover more than half the territory of some provinces. Meanwhile, Perus GDP has tripled, bringing a wave of wealth and construction in the big cities. Seafront neighbourhoods of adobe houses in Lima have been levelled and modern condominium towers now take their place. Even that international indicator of moneyed classes has started to appear: the organic supermarket.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But head away from the coast and into the mountain towns where the mining takes place and the wealth is harder to find. Crumbling storefronts only receive paint when local politicians use them for campaign advertisements. Deafening three-wheeled moto-taxis imported from India carry people around for a few cents a ride. These towns have become flashpoints of conflict as indigenous people complain they arent benefitting from the mining happening on their doorstep.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Protests and blockades around mines have routinely turned violent. Almost 200 people were killed in clashes with police and private security forces between 2006 and 2011.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But according to the national ombudsman, the number of local conflicts in Peru has been dropping since its peak of 286 in September 2009. As of October 2014, the figure was down to 201. While more than 70 per cent of these conflicts are still sparked by disputes at mines, they have become markedly less violent. In 2013, the ombudsman found no deaths from riots and protests, though at least nine people have been killed in clashes around mines in 2014.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The mining industry helped defuse the protests by increasing spending on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects. Through a voluntary tax, the foreign companies built schools and hospitals, roads and power lines. While these projects won the support of those who benefitted directly from them, they also created jealousy and competition between towns.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Social responsibility programs dont resolve conflict, they are the source of it, said Ximena Warnaars, a program co-ordinator with the indigenous rights organization Earthrights International in Lima. People who are directly affected (by the mine) benefit from CSR, but people who are indirectly affected  downriver  dont. If it were a state responsibility, everyone would have a right to a school. But mines just build schools in nearby communities.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           In the past  I would say 10 years ago  most people in the public sector believed in CSR, believed it was a good thing, said Gerardo Damonte Valencia, a professor of anthropology at the Pontifical Catholic University in Lima and a specialist in natural resource management. But now, you dont see many results, mostly because these initiatives are more about negotiations for accessing land or water than they are about development projects. If you have this conditionality, you are not doing development. Its an exchange: land for money.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           CSR cannot replace the state  You cannot rely on CSR for development. Its never going to work, Damonte said. Companies have realized they can buy some social peace, but youd have to be a fool to think they can develop the country.

           Like many Canadian NGOs, World Vision wants to diversify its funding sources and the private sector is the obvious place to turn. This trend has increased markedly over the last few years, ever since the government started cutting development assistance.

           Canada, which under Brian Mulroney spent 0.5 per cent of GDP in overseas aid, now spends only half that: 0.27 per cent. Thats about a third of the UNs official goal of 0.7 per cent for all developed nations, a target the U.K. reached for the first time in 2013.

          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The budget cuts came as the Conservative government set about restructuring Canadas aid delivery. Long-term funding of organizations was ended and NGOs were asked for project proposals akin to private-sector bids on contracts. Then, the government released its CSR policy and declared that aid would work to build a Canadian advantage in the extractive sector overseas, introducing the idea of economic diplomacy. Finally, the stand-alone aid branch of government, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was folded into Foreign Affairs to create the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD).
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The McLeod Group, a think-tank of prominent Canadian development experts, has been relentless in its critique of the Conservative government reforms. In a blog posting, it reported that instead of formally cutting funding, CIDA and DFATD delay approvals of dozens of projects until they shut down from lack of funds.

          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The Harper government has declared open season on the aid budget, writes the group, which collectively authors its papers. The challenge for CIDA in all of this is to ensure that Canadas aid program is not lured away from areas where it has knowledge, history and a legal obligation  road, railways, schools and hospitals  into acting as a shill for companies that do a bit of this on the side as a customary part of the package the industry offers to acquire mineral rights.

           At the countrys biggest development conference, held in Ottawa this spring, the hostility to the governments changes was palpable. (In order to attend, the Star agreed to not quote any presentations or speakers.) In one session, the moderator asked those who had their CIDA funding cut to stand up. At least half the audience of several hundred stood. Then she asked how many had a CIDA-funded program that was forced to close because the funding didnt come through in time and a quarter of the audience rose. Asked how many people had been forensically audited by CIDA, several dozen stood. When asked how many worked for organizations that no longer existed because their funding had been cut by CIDA, a handful of people rose to applause from the crowd. Among them was a representative of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, which was shuttered after 15 years of training police officers and government officials overseas.

           While the Harper government has been cutting back, Canadian corporations are ramping up. An increasing number of companies  especially in the mining sector  are adopting CSR policies and looking to spend money on philanthropic projects. When they sit down with cash-starved NGOs, the impetus to work together comes from both sides.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           New types of projects are emerging from these marriages of for- and non-profit organizations. USAID, the American government overseas development organization, has wholeheartedly embraced private partnerships marrying business interests with development goals. The U.K. and Australia are doing likewise.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But, as veterans of mining partnerships point out, CSR is inherently limited to small projects and limited benefits.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           CSR isnt bringing the private sector into aid, its bringing aid into the private sector, said Jeff Geipel of Engineers Without Borders. We arent interested in building a school for 100 kids. We want to do something bigger.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           CSR budgets are a tiny part of what mining companies spend and EWB is pushing them to redirect other spending to the local economy, something Geipel says would have a far greater impact.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           According to a World Gold Council study, CSR spending by gold-mining companies is less than 1 per cent of the amount they spend on procurement of services and materials. Of the 15 major international gold-mining companies surveyed, the total budget for community projects was $285 million. Those same companies spent more than $35 billion on goods and services.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           If mining companies bought more materials locally, the impact would be exponentially larger than any CSR project, said Scott Gilmore, a former Canadian diplomat who founded Building Markets, an NGO dedicated to incorporating businesses in developing countries into global supply chains.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           A lot of the more prominent companies  the Rio Tintos and the Iamgolds  are genuinely making an effort to have inclusive local growth, he said. But they actually dont spend that much money, if you take a look at their CSR budgets versus their gross. What these mining companies should be focused on is supply chain, not CSR budget.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           You could double your CSR budget and put a few million into the local economy. Or you could increase your local spend on supply chain by 2 per cent, just by sourcing your tires here, and that will have four or five times the impact on poverty reduction and economic growth, Gilmore said. So spend your energy on that, not on the window dressing of the CSR projects.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           EWB and Building Markets have both been working with local businesses to bring the quality of their products up to an international standard, which has been the biggest barrier to increasing local procurement at mine sites.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Yet, DFATD remains committed to CSR, releasing last month its revised policy, called Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance CSR in Canadas Extractive Sector Abroad, which only mentions procurement in passing.

           Over the ridge above Quiruvilca, another image of the mining community appears. Its a shanty town on the side of the highway, hundreds of slapped-together shacks. When the stiff wind blows, the snapping of plastic tarps echoes between mountain peaks.

           Pablo Juarez Robles sits astride his motorcycle and gestures to his shack. He used to be a farmer, but has turned to informal coal mining to survive. When Barrick came, Juarezs family farm was expropriated to make way for the mine. In return, he says, Barrick paid him about $200 (U.S.) and promised to train him and give him steady work.

           Now I am without a job and I havent been with Barrick for a year and a half, he said. I am anxious to work at Barrick mine, but they only give you contracts. Six months. Eight months. Then they liquidate you.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Last year, miners at Barricks Lagunas Norte mine went on strike for better wages. Unlike the prolonged and violent conflicts at other mines, this was resolved peacefully in a little more than a week. But Barrick is no stranger to trouble.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Barrick has been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses and environmental destruction at mines across the world: in Papua New Guinea, in Tanzania and in Chile. Even in Peru, where Barrick is considered one of the most responsible foreign companies, a protester was shot by a police officer at a Barrick mine in Ancash province in 2012.

          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Here in Quiruvilca, the negative effects of the mine are more mundane: broken promises, misunderstandings and desperate people.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           As tractor-trailers rumble along the highway to the mine, Juarez gestures to the collection of shacks and explains the residents grandiose plans. Most of the squatters are unemployed mining engineers and they take a technical approach to their shantytown. One day, there will be a grid of streets, a town square and even a soccer pitch.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           For them, there is no question, the mine acts only in its self-interest. Whatever development the mine has brought has passed them by.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           I am offended, legally offended, because of the lies, says Juarez. They dont fulfil their promises. Clearly, they bring development. For example, this road is because of the mine, but its for their own benefit, their cargo, for themselves. You see, for the community, the people are still poor and there is no progress.

           QUIRUVILCA, PERUTowering atop a pedestal in the main square, a golden statue of a miner with his headlamp and jackhammer gleams in the morning sun, a monument to the mineral wealth on which this town was built.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The Quiruvilca mine opened almost 100 years ago, and its blackened wooden structures still loom on the mountainside above the rooftops. But a century of mining copper, silver, zinc and gold brought little development to this remote settlement, nestled in a steep valley more than 4,000 metres up in the Peruvian Andes. The roads werent paved; many people didnt have electricity.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Nine years ago, another mine opened, operated by Toronto-based
           <a href="http://www.barrick.com/">
            Barrick Gold
           </a>
           , the worlds biggest gold mining company. It has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and royalties and the new-found wealth is visible everywhere. The local government has brought power to virtually everyone in town and is now hooking up remote villages. Through an infrastructure-for-taxes program, Barrick has constructed roads, a police college, a hospital and a school. A new highway has cut travel time to the coast from eight hours to 3.5.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But physical infrastructure is the low-hanging fruit of development. While everyone benefits from the new highway, not everyone can get work at the mine; unemployment and poverty remain endemic.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           I have to recognize that economically, (Barrick is) here and they allowed us to do projects. They allowed us to bring electricity to many communities, Mayor Walter Diaz Ramos says. But the job opportunities, which are a direct benefit to the families, theyre insufficient.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Making the jump from roads to jobs has proven difficult, and prompted people here to ask whether mining can bring lasting prosperity.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           In an effort to prove that Canadian mining companies can bring more than just a few jobs to the countries where they dig, the Canadian government has launched a series of international development pilot projects in mining communities. In Quiruvilca, it has funded a partnership between the charity
           <a href="http://www.worldvision.ca/">
            World Vision
           </a>
           and Barrick to develop the economy, but the small-scale jobs created  micro-entrepreneurs, theyre called  fall short of the economic activity needed to sustain the town long term.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The curse of the boom town remains on everyones mind. As Ramos said: Without mining, we wouldnt exist.

           It has been four years since Cirilo Paredes worked in the shafts, but he still looks like a miner.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           He spent 22 years as a tunnel builder and his deep-set eyes and creased skin testify to a life of hardships underground: long shifts in tight quarters with little light for low pay.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           When he couldnt take it anymore, he quit and passed his job to his son. There has never been much to do in mining towns other than mine. But as Paredes removes his cap to wipe sweat from his brow, he glances toward the sky filled with brilliant sunshine and says: You know, I dont mind physical labour at all, but its so much better out here in the open.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Paredes is the proud owner of Quiruvilcas first coal-delivery business. On a crisp and chilly day, he swung his shovel atop a giant pile of coal, mixing it with clay and forming it into balls to deliver to more than 200 households for heating and cooking. He makes more than he did as a miner and provides a service that benefits the community.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Paredes started the business after attending entrepreneurial workshops sponsored by World Vision and Barrick. His business plan won a local government competition that paid for three half-ton delivery motorbikes, which have allowed him to expand the company and hire three employees.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           With $500,000 from Barrick and another $500,000 from the Canadian government, World Vision launched the business workshops as a way to wean the town off total dependence on the mines. As the project winds down its third year, it can lay claim to a dozen successful small businesses in this town of 7,500, as well as a dozen more in the small villages nestled in the surrounding mountain valleys. From cheese factories to alpaca wool co-operatives, local restaurants to ice-cream vendors and even a doll manufacturer, the project has spawned a slew of micro-businesses.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Early successes like Paredess are promising, but the projects real victory is having unlocked the Peruvian governments own money for projects that will benefit local people. When the project started in 2010, the regional government spent just over $900,000 on five community development projects, said Onome Ako, the business development manager at World Vision. By 2012, those numbers had exploded: 21 projects were funded with $4.9 million. Most tellingly, without any help from World Vision, that momentum was sustained in 2013, when 19 community projects received $4.2 million.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           By spending $1 million, weve unlocked $9 million in government funds, Ako said. Were helping to ensure the resources are being used for the benefit of the local people. This empowers locals to hold government to account. Even if we walked away right now, weve already seen in the last two years that theres been an increase in locally driven projects.

           The program is built on an innovative tax scheme that was already in place to fight corruption. Called the 
           <i>
            Canon
           </i>
           , it puts half of a mines income tax in a fund earmarked for the region around the mine. The money is only released when the local government can present properly planned and budgeted projects. While this is an effective way to prevent local politicians from buying fancy cars or feeding inflated contracts to friends, it has had the effect of making it hard for regional governments to spend their own money.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           World Vision estimates that in 2009, before the project started, the Quiruvilca government was spending less that half of the approximately $20 million it was receiving in Canon per year  the vast majority of it on infrastructure projects. In 2013, after three years of project proposal training with World Vision, the local government spent 60 per cent of its Canon, and funded four times as many economic development projects as before.

           Peru, like many Latin American nations, is a place of extreme contrasts. There is the Amazon jungle in the east and tropical beaches in the west, with the snow-capped peaks of the Andes dividing the two. Across this diverse landscape, the wealthy generally occupy the coastal lowlands, while the indigenous and poor live at altitude or tucked into the jungle. But the fate of both rich and poor are linked to the mining industry.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Peru has long been Latin Americas largest gold producer and remains overwhelmingly dependent on extraction. The
           <a href="https://eiti.org/">
            Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
           </a>
           reports that mining and petroleum make up 62 per cent of Perus exports and account for more than 75 per cent of foreign investment. But it hasnt always been this way. Pulling oil and minerals out of the ground in Peru is a business that has ridden waves of nationalization and denationalization over the decades.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The floodgates for foreign investment most recently reopened in the 1990s after then-President Alberto Fujimori defeated the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who had controlled most of the countrys mineral-rich mountains. The results of this victory have been enormous: mining concessions in the previously unsafe mountains increased more than tenfold and now cover more than half the territory of some provinces. Meanwhile, Perus GDP has tripled, bringing a wave of wealth and construction in the big cities. Seafront neighbourhoods of adobe houses in Lima have been levelled and modern condominium towers now take their place. Even that international indicator of moneyed classes has started to appear: the organic supermarket.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But head away from the coast and into the mountain towns where the mining takes place and the wealth is harder to find. Crumbling storefronts only receive paint when local politicians use them for campaign advertisements. Deafening three-wheeled moto-taxis imported from India carry people around for a few cents a ride. These towns have become flashpoints of conflict as indigenous people complain they arent benefitting from the mining happening on their doorstep.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Protests and blockades around mines have routinely turned violent. Almost 200 people were killed in clashes with police and private security forces between 2006 and 2011.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But according to the national ombudsman, the number of local conflicts in Peru has been dropping since its peak of 286 in September 2009. As of October 2014, the figure was down to 201. While more than 70 per cent of these conflicts are still sparked by disputes at mines, they have become markedly less violent. In 2013, the ombudsman found no deaths from riots and protests, though at least nine people have been killed in clashes around mines in 2014.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The mining industry helped defuse the protests by increasing spending on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects. Through a voluntary tax, the foreign companies built schools and hospitals, roads and power lines. While these projects won the support of those who benefitted directly from them, they also created jealousy and competition between towns.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Social responsibility programs dont resolve conflict, they are the source of it, said Ximena Warnaars, a program co-ordinator with the indigenous rights organization Earthrights International in Lima. People who are directly affected (by the mine) benefit from CSR, but people who are indirectly affected  downriver  dont. If it were a state responsibility, everyone would have a right to a school. But mines just build schools in nearby communities.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           In the past  I would say 10 years ago  most people in the public sector believed in CSR, believed it was a good thing, said Gerardo Damonte Valencia, a professor of anthropology at the Pontifical Catholic University in Lima and a specialist in natural resource management. But now, you dont see many results, mostly because these initiatives are more about negotiations for accessing land or water than they are about development projects. If you have this conditionality, you are not doing development. Its an exchange: land for money.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           CSR cannot replace the state  You cannot rely on CSR for development. Its never going to work, Damonte said. Companies have realized they can buy some social peace, but youd have to be a fool to think they can develop the country.

           Like many Canadian NGOs, World Vision wants to diversify its funding sources and the private sector is the obvious place to turn. This trend has increased markedly over the last few years, ever since the government started cutting development assistance.

           </a>
           . Last year, in addition to the budget cuts, the government revealed that it had failed to spend at least $300 million that had been allocated to aid. Last spring, the OECD reported that Canadas overseas aid fell by $600 million, proportionally greater than every other member country but Portugal. This year, the government

          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Canada, which under Brian Mulroney spent 0.5 per cent of GDP in overseas aid, now spends only half that: 0.27 per cent. Thats about a third of the UNs official goal of 0.7 per cent for all developed nations, a target the U.K. reached for the first time in 2013.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The budget cuts came as the Conservative government set about restructuring Canadas aid delivery. Long-term funding of organizations was ended and NGOs were asked for project proposals akin to private-sector bids on contracts. Then, the government released its CSR policy and declared that aid would work to build a Canadian advantage in the extractive sector overseas, introducing the idea of economic diplomacy. Finally, the stand-alone aid branch of government, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was folded into Foreign Affairs to create the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD).

In a blog posting, it reported that instead of formally cutting funding, CIDA and DFATD delay approvals of dozens of projects until they shut down from lack of funds.

          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           The Harper government has declared open season on the aid budget, writes the group, which collectively authors its papers. The challenge for CIDA in all of this is to ensure that Canadas aid program is not lured away from areas where it has knowledge, history and a legal obligation  road, railways, schools and hospitals  into acting as a shill for companies that do a bit of this on the side as a customary part of the package the industry offers to acquire mineral rights.

           At the countrys biggest development conference, held in Ottawa this spring, the hostility to the governments changes was palpable. (In order to attend, the Star agreed to not quote any presentations or speakers.) In one session, the moderator asked those who had their CIDA funding cut to stand up. At least half the audience of several hundred stood. Then she asked how many had a CIDA-funded program that was forced to close because the funding didnt come through in time and a quarter of the audience rose. Asked how many people had been forensically audited by CIDA, several dozen stood. When asked how many worked for organizations that no longer existed because their funding had been cut by CIDA, a handful of people rose to applause from the crowd. Among them was a representative of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, which was shuttered after 15 years of training police officers and government officials overseas.

          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           While the Harper government has been cutting back, Canadian corporations are ramping up. An increasing number of companies  especially in the mining sector  are adopting CSR policies and looking to spend money on philanthropic projects. When they sit down with cash-starved NGOs, the impetus to work together comes from both sides.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           New types of projects are emerging from these marriages of for- and non-profit organizations. USAID, the American government overseas development organization, has wholeheartedly embraced private partnerships marrying business interests with development goals. The U.K. and Australia are doing likewise.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           But, as veterans of mining partnerships point out, CSR is inherently limited to small projects and limited benefits.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           CSR isnt bringing the private sector into aid, its bringing aid into the private sector, said Jeff Geipel of Engineers Without Borders. We arent interested in building a school for 100 kids. We want to do something bigger.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           CSR budgets are a tiny part of what mining companies spend and EWB is pushing them to redirect other spending to the local economy, something Geipel says would have a far greater impact.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           According to a World Gold Council study, CSR spending by gold-mining companies is less than 1 per cent of the amount they spend on procurement of services and materials. Of the 15 major international gold-mining companies surveyed, the total budget for community projects was $285 million. Those same companies spent more than $35 billion on goods and services.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           If mining companies bought more materials locally, the impact would be exponentially larger than any CSR project, said Scott Gilmore, a former Canadian diplomat who founded Building Markets, an NGO dedicated to incorporating businesses in developing countries into global supply chains.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           A lot of the more prominent companies  the Rio Tintos and the Iamgolds  are genuinely making an effort to have inclusive local growth, he said. But they actually dont spend that much money, if you take a look at their CSR budgets versus their gross. What these mining companies should be focused on is supply chain, not CSR budget.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           You could double your CSR budget and put a few million into the local economy. Or you could increase your local spend on supply chain by 2 per cent, just by sourcing your tires here, and that will have four or five times the impact on poverty reduction and economic growth, Gilmore said. So spend your energy on that, not on the window dressing of the CSR projects.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           EWB and Building Markets have both been working with local businesses to bring the quality of their products up to an international standard, which has been the biggest barrier to increasing local procurement at mine sites.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Yet, DFATD remains committed to CSR, releasing last month its revised policy, called Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance CSR in Canadas Extractive Sector Abroad, which only mentions procurement in passing.

           Over the ridge above Quiruvilca, another image of the mining community appears. Its a shanty town on the side of the highway, hundreds of slapped-together shacks. When the stiff wind blows, the snapping of plastic tarps echoes between mountain peaks.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Pablo Juarez Robles sits astride his motorcycle and gestures to his shack. He used to be a farmer, but has turned to informal coal mining to survive. When Barrick came, Juarezs family farm was expropriated to make way for the mine. In return, he says, Barrick paid him about $200 (U.S.) and promised to train him and give him steady work.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Now I am without a job and I havent been with Barrick for a year and a half, he said. I am anxious to work at Barrick mine, but they only give you contracts. Six months. Eight months. Then they liquidate you.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Last year, miners at Barricks Lagunas Norte mine went on strike for better wages. Unlike the prolonged and violent conflicts at other mines, this was resolved peacefully in a little more than a week. But Barrick is no stranger to trouble.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Barrick has been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses and environmental destruction at mines across the world: in Papua New Guinea, in Tanzania and in Chile. Even in Peru, where Barrick is considered one of the most responsible foreign companies, a protester was shot by a police officer at a Barrick mine in Ancash province in 2012.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           Here in Quiruvilca, the negative effects of the mine are more mundane: broken promises, misunderstandings and desperate people.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           As tractor-trailers rumble along the highway to the mine, Juarez gestures to the collection of shacks and explains the residents grandiose plans. Most of the squatters are unemployed mining engineers and they take a technical approach to their shantytown. One day, there will be a grid of streets, a town square and even a soccer pitch.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           For them, there is no question, the mine acts only in its self-interest. Whatever development the mine has brought has passed them by.
          </p>
          <p itemprop="articleBody">
           I am offended, legally offended, because of the lies, says Juarez. They dont fulfil their promises. Clearly, they bring development. For example, this road is because of the mine, but its for their own benefit, their cargo, for themselves. You see, for the community, the people are still poor and there is no progress.
