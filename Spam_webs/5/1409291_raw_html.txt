          for indoor workouts

        <p>
         Individuals will have the opportunity to adjust their level of incline and speed quickly, at their own pace. A comprehensive display screen works in conjunction with the buttons themselves and make it easy for the user to control the intensity level of their workout. The console screen itself is a large and vibrant blue screen that contains helpful readouts to help users get more out of their exercising experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals will be able to keep track of numerous pieces of relevant information, including their heart rate, pace, speed, and calories burned after a certain amount of time on the device.

        <h2>
         Quiet and Durable Design
        </h2>
        <p>
         The treadmill is marketed with a more intuitive and silent design in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="sole_treadmill_belt_1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45" height="329" src="http://skirmisher.org/wp-content/uploads/sole_treadmill_belt_1.jpg" width="696"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been described as unique in that it can provide users with all of the comfort of a standard deck, but with the addition of a quieter workout as well. Using the machine produces upwards of forty percent less sound, while putting less strain on the motor itself as well. Reviewers also found that the precise welding on the devices frames increased its handling and durability, allowing for a much more reliable experience, even when handled by multiple users. The

          treadmills construction
         </a>
         also includes some of the most powerful motors and chassis that may be purchased in the training class. The framework and inclines are designed to support the inclusion of the high quality motors, which feature larger diameters and balanced flywheels to allow for a vibration free surface. The inclusion of the flywheels themselves allow the motor to operate at a cooler frequency, which extends the life of the motor. The use of heavier flywheels also establishes a much smoother range of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
         This allows the treadmill to create a more realistic walking movement, which many users have reported enhanced the quality of their workout.
        </p>
        <h2>
         High Quality Belts and Rollers
        </h2>
        <p>
         In addition to all of the other sturdy and reliable parts included in the construction of the SOLE F85 Treadmill, the device makes use of durable rollers.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="sole_treadmill_belt_2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46" height="401" src="http://skirmisher.org/wp-content/uploads/sole_treadmill_belt_2.jpg" width="696"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         The rollers used in the machine measure approximately two and three quarters and are sealed with a powerful bearing design, with copper wires to help reduce static as they are used in the device. Utilizing larger rollers rollers ensures that a higher quality of contact surface is established against the belt, which helps extend both the life of the roller and the belt. This also establishes a much quieter range of motion for the user. The belts used are all two ply with four woven layers. While such belts are featured on this treadmill, the company has said that they used this variety of belts on all of their devices. The two rubber layers that sandwich the middle layer of PVC with a durable nylon backing ensures that the belts move smoothly over the rollers and deck.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of the materials work with one another, preventing the other parts of the device from working with excess strain.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Message Boards
        </h2>
        <p>
         While all of these features come together to provide a comfortable exercising experience for the customer, the group has also put in the effort to establish a comfortable environment outside of the customers home, on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
         SOLE offers message boards that are dedicated to different models and devices. This allows individuals to have the chance to work with both other customers and dedicated staff members to troubleshoot any problems that they may experience with their treadmills, or share stories and experiences relating to the devices. The message board also provides additional functionality in that they can be effortlessly synced with the treadmill itself. They can help recap the entire workout after the user is finished with it, allowing them to track their progress and see what types of benefits they are enjoying with the treadmill.

         <strong>
          While most exercise rooms we have seen with the SOLE E25 Elliptical are designed with prominent functionality in mind
         </strong>
         , it is important to never stray too far away from aesthetically pleasing principles as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="sole_e25_elliptical" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68" height="465" src="http://skirmisher.org/wp-content/uploads/sole_e25_elliptical.png" width="668"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         Many people may not realize it, but the design and your feelings in the room can directly affect your performance in it. This means that by focusing on the decorative appeal of the exercise room, you will also be strengthening the functional appeal, while will result in more effective training. A well maintained room will result in less distractions and more personal comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
         Typically, there is much more to establishing an attractive environment in your exercise room than putting together functional pieces of equipment and arranging according to preference. It is always a good idea to observe colors and basic design principles in order to ensure that the space is used in an effective manner. Consider some of the following sections of the room that can be decorated in order to provide you with an attractive and practical training environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Always remember that no matter what design principles you plan on utilizing in the atmosphere, it is important to be comfortable with the room itself.

         Selecting the Right Flooring Options For The SOLE E25 Elliptical
        </h2>
        <p>
         If you plan on having an active workout area in your home, you will need to work with the right floors (that can support the weight of the SOLE E25 Elliptical). Most
         <a href="http://www.ellipticalwatch.com/">

         are quite heavy (which is also true for

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="sole_e25_elliptical_pedals_1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69" height="391" src="http://skirmisher.org/wp-content/uploads/sole_e25_elliptical_pedals_1.png" width="696"/>

        </p>
        <p>
         This means considering not only the decorative appeal of certain materials, but also the practical.
        </p>
        <p>
         Heavy exercise equipment, especially larger machinery or weights, can be hard on the surface of your flooring. Regularly used equipment could scratch and mar wood, tile, and vinyl surfaces, while wearing down carpet fibers, damaging both the carpet and the flooring underneath it. Even if you are using exercise equipment that has rubber feet, it can still end up leaving marks or smears along the surface of your floors, even after just a couple of uses. In order to effectively protect your floor, consider purchasing foam pads that can be interlocked, or a carpet that is based in foam.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even if you do not plan on utilizing such flooring options for the entire area, even a few stylish and functional rugs under key pieces of equipment (such as the SOLE E25) can reduce the strain on the floor.

        <h2>
         Establishing Appropriate Colors
        </h2>
        <p>
         While everyone has their favorite colors, there are certain hues that can be much more energizing and engaging than others.
        </p>
        <p>
         Depending on what type of workouts you plan on enjoying in the room, there are several options for you to choose from. For more hands on and active workouts, such as with aerobic and weight lifting exercises, it is a good idea to paint with oranges, yellows, and reds. For a more calming and relaxing exercising experience, such as with tai chi or yoga, focusing on crisper and more soothing tones of aqua, lavender, and green can help you achieve more mental serenity. With dynamic exercises, you will want to establish explosive hues that will motivate you to keep moving.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, if you want to establish a calmer and more introspective environment, natural, flowing tones are recommended.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Your Planned Equipment
        </h2>
        <p>
         Establish your workout equipment according to your needs and exercising goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you plan on working with body building equipment, it is highly recommended to set aside a section of the room where you can set a weight bench and the appropriate bar bells and free weights. If you plan on establishing a section of the room that will work with elliptical equipment, however, you will have more practical and stylish options to work with. The SOLE E25 elliptical trainer, for example, can be an excellent addition to your workout room because of the powerful functionality that it can provide you for all of your weight loss needs. In addition to the features provided with the machine, it can also be arranged as a centerpiece for your exercising room.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sheer size and the sleek style that these devices possess can allow you to focus on establishing them as focal points, while you arrange the rest of the environment around them.

        <p>
         You should always strive for comfort in your exercising room, otherwise you may not be as motivated to use it as often as you need to in order to reach your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Allow for plenty of natural light options to flow through the room. If there is a window, work with the outside area to create an attractive view. Always keeps the area well ventilated to ensure maximum comfort, and look into shelving options to allow for

         , magazines, even televisions and music systems. All of these items can be established as functional and decorative with the right arrangements. Work with negative space to allow for a natural flow between the functional and a decorative.

        <p>
         Consider the dailycaller.com article about Awai Gul, a suspected Taliban terrorist who was incarcerated at the USs Guantanamo prison in December 2002. According to American officials, Gul died at Guantanamo on February 8, 2011 from a

        <h2>
         The Rest of the Story
        </h2>
        <p>
         Guls passing might have simply been another statistic along with the other seven prisoners who have died at the US prison, except for one fact: Gul was one of six prisoners that were originally demanded in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bengdhal in June 2014. Secretary of State Chuck Hagel confirmed that there was a sixth person involved in the original trade talks with the extremist group during Senate hearing on the prisoner exchange. The government later released Guls name as the sixth prisoner requested in the swap.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the US government, Gul was a top Taliban recruiter and the commander of a primary Taliban base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan where he also managed the guest house. Officials have also alleged that Gul had direct ties with Osama bin Laden dating back to 1990 and was involved with him in operations. Lawyers representing Gul tell a different story.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to his attorneys, Gul did meet bin Laden at a meeting of wealthy Saudis involved in raising money to build a hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gul claimed that he was unaware of bin Ladens ties to terrorists and his anti-American positions at that time. Gul further claimed that while he did become involved with the Taliban under duress, he attempted to resign for the organization because of his growing disgust with their increasing corruption, abuse and use of terrorism to govern.
        </p>
        <p>
         Guls legal team, represented by W. Matthew Dodge, prepared a press release shortly after his passing, noting that Guantanamo placed detainees in one of three categories: court prosecution, cleared for release and indefinite detention. Gul was placed in indefinite detention after being detained. Dodge also stated that Gul was taken into custody while traveling to meet with US military officials.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dodge adamantly states that Gul was not a terrorist and that worked with the Americans during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He characterized Gul as a peaceful man who often repeated an Afghan proverb: You cannot wash blood with blood. According to the press release, he simply wanted to return home to be reunited with his family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the Gul defense teams version of the events surrounding his incarceration, it is understandable why the American government was suspicious of Guls ties and interned him at Guantanamo. He had a clear link to bin Laden and had been active in the Taliban. Based on factual evidence, Gul was an active recruiter for the Taliban and managed a known Taliban camp and guesthouse. In the Bengdhal trade it is also telling that Gul was one of the six suspected Guantanamo detainees originally demanded in exchange for the American soldier.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Facts and Truth
        </h2>
        <p>
         What is complete fact and truth in Guls story will be debated with very little likelihood of a final outcome. However, part of his legacy has come to light after his passing as the sixth man in a highly controversial exchange of prisoners between the US government and a Middle East terrorist group.
