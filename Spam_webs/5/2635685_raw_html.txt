         Informed people know that purifiers, which use the
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          HEPA
         </strong>
         filters, work more effectively to help remove airborne pollutants than air purifiers that use a simpler air filtration system. The trade-off is that you have to buy replacement filters, but there is no way around this if you want solid performance from your air cleaning system.

        <p>
         The praise was not universal, however as two basic complaints did emerge that went beyond simple quality control issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first was the noise, but when you buy an air cleaning system of this size and power, it probably is too much to hope that it will be silent, as well. There are silent cleaning systems  VERY quiet, but these run on an entirely different technology that seems almost like magic, and these are prone to emit unpleasant odors of their own. Such air-cleaning units also tend to be very expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second complaint was vibration. The unit seemed to be a bit off-balance, so that the body would vibrate at low settings. If this unit is sitting right at your feet, this is going to be a problem. Put it in a BIG room, and choose a smaller unit for cozier settings.
         <i>
         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         At $144 dollars, the powerful Honeywell 50250S
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          HEPA
         </strong>
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          Round Air Purifier
         </strong>
         is very cost-effective, for its intended use. If the unit becomes too noisy, here is a tip: change your filter. Unusually high noise is often a symptom of a clogged air filter. It will quiet down again as soon as unrestricted airflow is restored.
        </p>

         Replacing air filters is often an unattractive prospect for many potential buyers. As we said earlier, if you want performance, this is unavoidable. Beware air conditioner makers who claim that you need only vacum or wash their filter for effective air conditioning. You cannot have both. There are such AC systems, but they are nowhere in the same class as an

         </strong>
         air cleaning system.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, you will need to change the
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          HEPA
         </strong>
         filter every four to six months, but changing them out is a snap, and replacement filters are not terribly expensive. Technology may do better one day, but for now, this is the state of things.

        <p>
         Buying a window air conditioner unit may sound like an easy task, but there really is much to understand about them or you are certain to get burned, unless you do your homework. However, lucky you, now that you have this comparison review in hand, you will discover that we have done much of your legwork for you.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many questions to answer, and we have covered them all in the previous reviews on air conditioners that we have written. In this recap, let us touch again on these key areas of concern and propose some solutions, based on our previous discussions. We will also offer reference to these reviews to save you hunting about for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         In earlier reviews, we reviewed two similar window air conditioning units costing around $125  $150 dollars, to help you to get a feel for how to select the right air conditioner for your home. In this comparison review, we will bring a third patron to the party  the formidable FRA086AT7 window air conditioning unit. Stay with us now as we will quickly review the main features and benefits of each unit described and we will revisit our conclusions about each unit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <b>
          Frigidaire FRA052XT7 5,000-BTU Mini Window Air Conditioner
         </b>
         <a href="http://sincereproductreviews.com/2014/02/fra054xt7-window-air-conditioner/">
          http://sincereproductreviews.com/2014/02/fra054xt7-window-air-conditioner/
         </a>
         is a neat and compact AC unit that is rated to cool an area of up to 150 square feet. We touched on this ac model in our review of the FRA054XT7 window air conditioner unit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FRA052XT7 window air conditioning unit offers three temperature options Cool, High Cool and Low Cool. There is also a fan option that when selected turns off the compressor to save power. This is great when all you need to do is to move the air.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since this unit rates for a room area of 150 sq. feet, it would be perfect for a bedroom, home office, or other small room, but we concluded that the previous customers were unhappy with the cooling performance for this unit. As such, we could not recommend it  so on to something a bit more satisfying.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <b>
          Frigidaire FRA086AT7 8,000 BTU Window-Mounted Compact Window Air Conditioner with Temperature Sensing Remote
         </b>
         is a powerhouse unit that can cool a room as large as 350 square feet.
        </p>
        <p>
         The general features of this air conditioner unit are the same as those of its brethren, but the breakout feature for this puppy is the temperature sensing remote control. Its design makes it is easy to use and the large green digital LED display is easy to read even at night. This remote control works remarkably well even when you aim it away from the main unit.
        </p>
        <p>
         This ac unit is light at just over 50 lbs, and is easy to install. It offers a clean sleek design that looks great when installed in your window. It doesnt appear unsightly or bulky the way some other window air conditioners might.
        </p>
        <p>
         For this unit, customer opinion seemed to be all over the place. One reviewer might say it is noisy, another will say it is not. One will say it does not cool efficiently, and the very next reviewer to speak will say that it cools great!
        </p>
        <p>
         About the only consistent arguments focus on the loud beep, which is more of a moot point, since these beeps only occur when one presses a button on the control panel  and there is always the remote to save the day.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another complaint was that the air conditioning unit seemed to be more susceptible to mold problems than other systems that earlier users had purchased. This complaint was persistent enough for us to take notice  and it is something that you should think about, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other complaint with any legs was that the plastic casing was durable enough for daily use, but too many users received units that were broken or otherwise damaged. The damage seemed most likely caused by handling during shipping, so the construction needs reinforcement, or the unit packing for shipping needs to be made more carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of cooling though, we can find no reason not to consider this window air conditioner unit. You should be working with an installer in any case, so to make sure that you are getting a quality install, you might consider giving the model number to your installer, and letting him worry about delivering and qualifying your air conditioner unit. There is an extra cost to get help, but it wont be extreme for a window installation, and at least you can be sure of adequate protection, when the heat is on.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next window air conditioner unit for your consideration is the
         <b>
          Frigidaire FRA054XT7 Window Mounted Mini Conditioner
         </b>
         . This unit is similar to the FRA052XT7 so both units are covered in the same review at
         <a href="http://sincereproductreviews.com/2014/02/fra054xt7-window-air-conditioner/">
          http://sincereproductreviews.com/2014/02/fra054xt7-window-air-conditioner/
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The FRA054XT7 window air conditioner unit rates to cool a room up to 165 square feet. This coverage is a bit larger than the FRA052XT7
         <b>
         </b>
         model but the extra capacity apparently is just enough to eliminate the cooling problems with the FRA052XT7.
        </p>
        <p>
         Customers LOVE this unit, and remark specifically on its ability to cool quickly and efficiently. The FRA054XT7 is clearly the more advanced unit of the two, offering more cooling power, electronic controls an air cleaning system and even a 24-hour timer for custom cooling schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
         We found this model to be the best of the lot, which is proof that if you pay more, you dont necessarily
         <i>
          get
         </i>
         more. You really do have to understand how something like an air conditioner works
         <i>
          in practice
         </i>
          thus the importance of customer reviews. That was no problem for the unit in question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Customers were delighted with this model and naturally, they
         <i>
          loved
         </i>
         the price. At the time of this writing, we found this unit at
         <a class="StrictlyAutoTagAnchor" href="http://sincereproductreviews.com/tag/amazon/" title="View all articles about Amazon here">
          Amazon
         </a>
         where it was selling for only about $150. That is only about $30 more than the FRA052XT7 model, which will only cool a room up to 130 sq. feet. Not only does the FRA054XT7 cover a larger area, but also it does so more efficiently  which is of course a big savings on operating costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Some Final Thoughts
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         All of the window air conditioner units mentioned in this comparison review offer fan-cooling modes, air cleaning systems, and automatic restart after power failure. All except the FRA052XT7 offer, remote controls  which are a real convenience  but fortunately, the FRA054XT7 costing only a few dollars more has a fully functional remote  and we could find no complaints critical of its performance.
        </p>
        <p>
         We should remember that any of the issues that reviewers complained about could be caused simply by a failure to install the unit properly. Point of fact; unless you are an expert, you may not even have selected an air conditioner unit of proper size for the area that you intend to cool, no matter how accurate you feel your computations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Window air conditioner units are more complex than they seem, and even if the installation instructions might be excellent, unless you understand such principles as power load, grounding, room insulation, condensation, humidity, airflow design, etc., we strongly recommend you to get professional help to be SURE that the installation is made properly. It is what you do NOT know that will kill you.
        </p>

          And The Winner Is
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         In our opinion, the Frigidaire
         <b>
          FRA054XT7
         </b>
         window air conditioner unit wins easily. This selection is made based on the improved feature set, and the fact that it has a remote control, but mostly we decided on the strength of the customer reviews at amazon that, after proper analysis, seem to hold together to suggest that this unit is sturdy, reliable and delivers on what it promises.

        <h3>
         Air Purifiers: Health Benefit or Money Sink?
        </h3>
        <p>
         Do you own an air purifier? If not, there is a good chance that you would be interested in owning one in the future. Air purifiers are rapidly increasing in popularity because they make indoor air healthier and cleaner.
        </p>
        <p>
         You do not need to invest a fortune, either. Of course, the more you pay, the more effective system you will get, but even a moderately positioned system, costing less than $100 dollars, will produce a stunning difference in your air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
         Take, the germguardian 3-in-1 air cleaning system [
         <a href="http://amzn.to/1bpGFjr">
          http://amzn.to/1bpGFjr
         </a>
         ]. This air cleaning system not only looks good, but also it is perfect for alleviating the miseries of allergy sufferers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The germguardian 3-in-1 air cleaning systemfeatures three integrated air-purifying technologies, that work together to place this filter head and shoulders ahead of anything else I have tried.
        </p>
        <p>
         It goes well beyond just pulling dust particles out of the air. It also removes extremely tiny particles, such as, allergens, germs, even bacteria and odors from your rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The filtering system for the germguardian 3-in-1 air cleaning systemsupports a charcoal pre-filter that captures odors and large particles, such as lint and pet hair. The filtering system also uses a true
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          HEPA
         </strong>
         filter, to extract99.97% of airborne particles, dust mites, mold spores, even pollens and pet dander.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, a blue UV-C light kills bacteria and viruses by use of titanium dioxide. You will not know what that means before you read the manual  but as you might imagine  it is very cool.
        </p>
        <p>
         As for what the consumers think, the reviews at amazon site are stellar. To read them for yourself, just click on this link [
         <a href="http://amzn.to/1bpGFjr">
          http://amzn.to/1bpGFjr
         </a>
         ] and you can then be the judge.
        </p>
        <p>
         You would think that such a complicated air filtering system would be difficult to keep up, but in fact  replacing these filters is both inexpensive and easy. They are a single module, so you just yank the old one, and push in a new one  easy as can be. Filter replacement is a serious consideration when purchasing an air filter, so do not let this escape your attention if you are in the
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          market
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         You will notice an immediate improvement as soon as you turn on your germguardian 3-in-1 air cleaning system, but that is nothing, compared to the air quality you will achieve after using the cleaning system for several months.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fan doesnt wear out fast either, another major factor in purchasing an air cleaning system. Many inexpensive units run silent for four months, then they start to make noise  and after six months you simply cannot live with them any longer. Not so with the germguardian 3-in-1 air cleaning system. The unit remains quiet and effective, and the longer you leave it working, the cleaner your air quality will become.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, are air purifiers worth the buy? If you do your homework, then the answer is an enthusiastic yes. It is easy to over-do and to buy something that (supposedly) zaps odors and bacteria hundreds of feet away from the unit, or to under-do and get something that traps a bit of dust  but otherwise has little effect on your air quality.
        </p>
        <p>
         The unit recommended here certainly is a good buy  so if you want to remove the guess work  and get something that you will be happy with, use the link below to hop on over to amazon and buy this air purifier. Then, just sit back and enjoy air quality like you never imagined possible.

        <p>
         Air cleaners and purifiers are very popular for good reasons. They are affordable and even promote good health, but to get real benefits from them, you need to understand how to shop for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Air cleaners generally use permanent filters to trap dust and air particles. Air purifiers actually attack and destroy air pollutants, such as bacteria, spores, and allergens. The Winix WAC5500 is an extremely effective

         that pairs up a carbon filter with a true

         filter to scrub effectively the air in your environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, due to the high-tech nature of air purifiers in general, many manufactures have reduced them to the equivalent of nineteenth century snake oil, which upon a single dose would even cure a rainy day. Unfortunately, most of these units just arent as effective as we are led to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, what really does constitute a great buy in air purifiers? I just so happens that we have an answer for you  but certainly not the only game in town. We have reviewed several very reliable air purifiers here at Sincere Product Reviews. We urge you to visit the archives and read some of them.

          Overview
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         The Winix Air Purifier is actually a very effective unit for use in bedrooms and for other smaller areas of your home. It has a large effective range that will purify a room as large as 260 feet  and thats pretty big.
        </p>
        <p>
         While this
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">

         </strong>
         does claim to use some high-tech, it still must be classified as a standard

          HEPA

         air purifier, as the more technical features  while maybe not quite gimmicks  certainly do not move this purifier into a class of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
         Coupled with
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">

         As the high-tech goes, the Winix WAC5500 True
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          HEPA
         </strong>
         Air Purifier boasts both

         technology and a Smart Sensor with Auto Mode although there is no clear technical explanation of what they do  nor how they do it.
        </p>
        <p>
         One thing seems certain though. Customers love it  so if you are looking for an
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">

         </strong>
         that actually works  you might be willing to overlook just what is being done to achieve this effect.

         Of 213 customer reviews, this product managed to place 184 of them above three stars with another 19 at the three star level. This earns the Winix
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          air purifier
         </strong>
         4.5 stars out of five! As we said, customers think the world of this product  and as the unit is at work in their homes  they are the best qualified to judge.
        </p>
        <p>
         The few complaints you see here had to do with bad units that died in a week, or a unit that issued a bad smell, and one customer even says that the unit does not clean the air effectively, but bad units happen  and ten complaints out of well over 200 are sufficiently high odds to bank on.
         <i>
         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         Price for this unit might put you off though. It costs around $200  but if you want a proven effective air cleaner and are willing to pay a bit to get it  then you might just have found the solution to your problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         We hope so, anyway.

          Overview of the Frigidaire FRA054XT7 Window Air Conditioner
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         The FRA054XT7
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          Air Conditioner
         </strong>
         is a window installed air conditioning unit rated at 5,000 BTU and capable to cool rooms as large as 165 square feet. One must take care with ratings such as these, though. The conditions under which you will use your air conditioner may not be the same pristine environment in which your air conditioner was rated.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://sincereproductreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Frigidaire-FRA054XT7.jpg">

         </a>
         Therefore, the only true way to rate an air conditioner is to install it, and see what happens. The next best option is to read reviews from those who have been there before you. This second option lacks the advantage of being hands on, but is less expensive than finding you have the wrong unit  and having to start over again.
        </p>
        <p>
         The unit covered here has the advantage of having been well reviewed to very positive responses from previous users, so that is already the best reason to consider it, if you need a window air conditioner unit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FRA054XT7 Window
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          Air Conditioner
         </strong>
         unit is a modern design, and comes with electronic button controls that allow you easily to set your desired comfort level. The temperature display is large and easy to read even at night, so you are able to monitor the current set temperature at a glance.
        </p>
        <p>
         This unit is designed really to pump out the cool air. It has two directional output air vents at the top of the unit that you can point in the direction of hot spots, and the entire front of the unit is on big output grill that makes you feel cold just to look at it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Optional pleated side panels and a compact design ease installation by enabling you to adjust the unit to fit snuggly inside your window. That does not mean that you should attempt installation on your own though. Installation of a window air conditioner unit might look simple, but believe us when we tell you that installing air conditioning is ALWAYS a job for the experts.

         feature an effortless temperature control that maintains the preset room temperature and regulates by turning the ac unit on and off as the room temperature changes. There is also the auto-cool mode that adjusts fan speed as the room temperature changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Should you experience a power failure, there is no problem. Instead of digging about to find where you put the manual to reset the system, you need only  do nothing! The ac unit will automatically resume operation at the settings you had in place when the power is restored.

         Out of 186 total customer reviews, only 21 of these fell below three stars, giving the unit a total rating of 4.1 stars. Because of the way that we do things here at Sincere Product Reviews, that rating can be good or bad, as readers of our product, reviews should know by now, but this is a very good rating in this instance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most every review, to the last one, laments the tale of a broken unit, or perhaps an customer service issue that went awry, but not one of these complaints focused on the failure of this air conditioner unit to do its job.

         On the plus side, customers really love that this air conditioner unit runs silently so that they can sleep at night and they are delighted at how well it regulates room temperature. According to them, this unit cools quickly and the system even offers the added benefit of cleaning the air of pollutants, room odors, and bacteria by way of the antibacterial mesh filter that just slides out for easy replacement.
        </p>
        <p>
         They are also real fans of the full function remote that enables them to adjust their window air conditioner from their EZ chair of bed. These amenities may not seem to important when reading the brochures, but in practice, just reaching for the remote laying there on your night stand does make for quite a difference in terms of convenience.

         The current price for this unit on amazon is a startling $129.95. For that price, and supported by solid approval ratings, this window air conditioner is a totally fabulous buy, worth that amount of money any day of the week. Of course, you still need to factor in installation costs, but you should plan for this expense anyway, if you need a window air conditioning unit. Installation is NOT a job for a nonprofessional.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you look at this window air conditioner as a whole, there is just no reason to take a risk on something else. The unit is inexpensive, mounts easily (saving big money on installation costs), full featured and it does its job well.

          How to Select an Air Conditioning System
         </b>
        </h2>
        <p>
         Running air conditioning in your home is expensive  no doubt about it. The costs need not be outrageous though  assuming that you understand at least a bit, of what you are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are two main areas to controlling air conditioning costs. The process begins before you make your installation, and ends upon selection of your air conditioning system. This sounds simple, but is very important to note right up front, because after making your selection  there is little more that you can do to manage the cost of operation.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://sincereproductreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Iced-Over-Air-Conditioner.jpg">

         Listen up now  while we give you the basics for installing an air conditioner that you can actually afford to use. Then keep your eyes open for future posts that will review some
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          AC
         </strong>
         systems that just might be a good fit for your life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our first important step is to understand what the energy rating efficiency of your air conditioner means, and how to use this information. It is very important to understand how cost fits in here. A more expensive unit may cost more in the short run, but may save you TONs of money (on your electric bill) over a few years  after which  it begins paying for itself!
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively, buying a more expensive unit rated so low that it cannot get the job done means wasting your money now  and forever into the future. Whenever the hot weather sets in, it will cost a fortune to cool your home.
        </p>
        <p>
         What you want then, is to be able to relate your purchase to the size of the area it needs to keep cool. You could ask your contractor for advice, if you think you can trust him. Tread carefully though. I mean, just
         <i>
          who
         </i>
         is going to sell you that air conditioner anyway?
        </p>
        <p>
         To cool smaller areas with a window air conditioning unit, you can use this chart to determine the right rating. Skimping on cost in this situation is a bad idea. The goal is to spend a bit of money here, but to do it wisely. Buy a quality unit with good customer reviews that is large enough to cool the room efficiently.

         To cool larger areas, it is best to install central air conditioning. This is expensive, and complicated, so you are going to need to work with someone who you can trust. Watch how he goes about his work. Here are some things to keep in mind.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Did your contractor inspect your house thoroughly before offering you a solution?
         </li>
         <li>
          What do customer reviews for this contractor look like?
         </li>
         <li>
          Take some time to research his recommendation. If you can find it at amazon so that there are customer reviews, so much the better. Does your research agree with what you hear from your contractor?
         </li>
         <li>
          Ducting, air intakes and the like are usually in place already, but if not, you can be sure that you contractor has done his homework work by having him show you the data. If the ducting
          <b>
           is
          </b>
          already in place, make sure that your contractor understands what the limitations are by making a complete inspection of your home and reviewing her findings with you. Ask about bad ducting and air volume requirements to make sure that whoever installed your air conditioning system digs in, and does a proper job.
         </li>
         <li>
          Understand the
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           SEER
          </strong>
          rating for your air conditioning unit. The higher the SEER, the more efficient and less costly your unit will be to operate. Do not go looking for a powerhouse
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           AC
          </strong>
          system in this regard. Work with your trusted contractor to find an air conditioning system with a rating in the middle, as opposed to units with higher ratios and thereby higher prices.
         </li>
         <li>
          Understanding a central air conditioning system will always be over your head, but you should not be entirely ignorant on the subject. Information on
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           SEER
          </strong>
          (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) is available at any reputable site that installs air conditioning units, along with all you need to make a unit selection. Such information usually will not include the specifics required for installation to your home, but the more that you understand, the better off you will be.
         </li>
         <li>
          When shopping for a
          <b>
           new
          </b>
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">

          system, be sure it has an
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           Energy Star
          </strong>
          label. There likely is little reason to replace your older system just to install an
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           Energy Star
          </strong>
          product, but for new systems, this is necessary.
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           Energy Star
          </strong>
          air conditioning systems are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency, and are about 20 percent more efficient than other air conditioning systems.
         </li>
         <li>
          Price is not everything. Now that your trusted contractor has steered you to the perfect
          <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
           AC
          </strong>
          system for your home, why not go off and buy it cheaper? If the trusted contractor with whom you are working can arrange this lower price  fine. Otherwise, work with your trusted contractor  even if it means paying a little more. This person has won your confidence  and probably has already earned her pay already, just by virtue of this fact  assuming that you followed the steps outlined above. It is vital that you work with someone whom you can trust.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         That about covers what you need to understand, beyond what your trusted contractor will tell you. Just remember to check any preliminary information given you by your contractor  and if any of it proves fuzzy  move on. You have the wrong contractor. If the information proves valid, then it is safe to move on into the complicated stuff without worry.
        </p>
        <p>
         You are looking for someone who takes the time to understand your home
         <i>
          thoroughly
         </i>
         before making any suggestion for purchasing an
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          AC
         </strong>
         unit. A quick walk thru your home just will not cut it. If, for example, your original
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          AC
         </strong>
         installer installed too small an intake port for your newly proposed system, you need to know. Your contractor has to
         <i>
          demonstrate
         </i>
         that he cares how this job will turn out.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of this care might seem like overkill, but if you go into this project ignorant, then you will almost certainly lose a lot of money, and likely end up with an inappropriate
         <strong class="StrictlyAutoTagBold">
          AC
         </strong>
         system in the end. People are what they are, so dont fight it. You must KNOW whom you are working with  and you will be fine.
