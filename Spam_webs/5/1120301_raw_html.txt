            Sir Goldsworthy Gurney
           </a>
           a Cornish engineer invented the first high pressure horseless steam carriage, although it was not a great success, due the understandable apprehension of passengers who had to ride in a compartment situated directly above the dangerous steam boiler.

           The
           <b>
            Gurney Steamer
           </b>
           is similar to a coach. It is mounted on 6 wheels where 4 wheels sustain the vehicle weight while the 2 front wheels, the so callet "pilot" wheels, replace the horses and are used for turning the
           <b>
            steam carriage
           </b>
           .
           <br/>
           <br/>
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir Gurney later refined his design to provide a separate carriage which was hauled by the engine, known as the
           <b>
            Gurney Drag
           </b>
           .

          <p>
           In 1829 this steam driven carriage journeyed from London to Bath, although its maiden journey was marred by an accident just outside Reading where it collided with the Bristol Mail Coach. It was later attacked by a Luddite mob outside Melksham and had to be escorted into Bath under guard. The average speed for the round trip was
           <b>
            15 mph
           </b>
           and is claimed as the
           <b>
            first long journey
           </b>
           undertaken by a mechanised vehicle at a sustained speed.

           <br/>
           This same year Gurneys steam injection system was installed in George and Robert Stephensons
           <b>
            Rocket
           </b>
           for the Rainhill Trials where it attained a speed of
           <b>
            30 mph
           </b>
           , a record at that time. However Gurneys contribution was not acknowledged by the Stephensons, as neither was Trevithicks pioneering work on high pressure steam boilers. Gurney had to later publicly rebuke claims that Stephenson was the inventor of the steam locomotive, an idea which still persists today.

           Gurney is probably best known for inventing the
           <b>
            "Limelight"
           </b>
           .
           <br/>
           He invented the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, a system for burning a jet of oxygen and hydrogen to produce an intensely hot flame. He experimented with it on different substances and discovered that a brilliant light was produced when the flame was played on a chunk of lime. This was limelight, and was so intense that it could be seen
           <b>
            95 miles
           </b>
           away. It found many uses in the theatre, (hence the phrase 'to be in the limelight') but it was limelight's use in
           <b>
            lighthouses
           </b>
           that brought Sir Gurney fame.

            "My improvements in Locomotive engines and the apparatus connected threwith, consist in a certain arrangement and modification of the various essential parts of locomotive high-pressure steam engines , whereby such parts are adapted to each other , and combined together in a suitable manner for coaches or travelling carriages, so as to impel the same forward upon common roads and highways without the aid of horses, and with a sufficient speed for the conveyance of passengers and goods. And whereas it is by virtue of particular combinations of all the essential parts of locomotive engines, and of certain apparatus connected therewith, and by the adaption thereof one to another, that I have been enabled ,after long study and repeated trials, at great expence, to produce a locomotive engine, applied in a stage coach, which is capable of advancing itself in an efficient manner along a common road when loaded with passengers; hence my chief claim to improvement consists in the totality of that particular combination of parts one with another which constituted the  locomotive engine or steam coach which is herein after described. By such description competent mechanicians may construct and execute locomotive engines for steam coaches after that manner which I have found to perform properly for carrying passengers on common roads. The previous attempts by other persons to attain that object have proved unsuccessful for want of knowing how to combine the parts of locomotive engines with each other and with the apparatus of travelling coaches in a suitable manner for the purpose; but I have succeeded in finding out the particular means necessary to be used for attaining the desired result"
