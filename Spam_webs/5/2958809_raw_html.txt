               Well,
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               I've finally found enough energy to write another post. Needless to say, the first two weeks of teaching have been absolutely exhausting! The kids here are a mixed bag to say the least. My students are from a wide variety of Nablus families, some from middle class families, some from rich families and some from pretty average Palestinian families. Many of my students fathers, as iI found out recently, have spent time in Israeli prisons for resistance and political activities, which pretty much seems to be considered a crime by the Israelis. This is one of the reasons why they all seem to study science or engineering later in life, politics here is just too dangerous of a profession.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               The kids are full of life still, but you can definitely see the trauma in some, if not most of them.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               One day I asked after a rowdy gym class of dodge ball, in an attempt to calm them down, I asked them to draw what they felt. The results were saddening and yet inspiring at the same time. Many of the children drew pictures of death and destruction, which i guess shouldn't be surprising especially since many of my students come from the old city which has seen so much violence since the second intifada. But some of the kids, even some of the ones who drew scenes of death also drew scenes of a victorious Palestine. Their views on this matter are obviously simple and underdevelopped, but nevertheless it shows that their spirit hasn't been completely killed. Hope is still alive here, barely, but still breathing, especially amongst the children.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               My students are as misbehaved as can be, but I've managed to exert some control in my classroom, but given what so many of them have been through, I'm actually quite surprised at how behaved they are... They just need to learn how to form a proper line.. hahaha.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               Golda Meier once said something along the line of, 'the day I see Palestinians forming a straight line, that is the day Israel should be afraid...' This sums up my experience so far, not only with the children but with just about everything here. Whether its politics, educational philosophy or simply just forming a line, if Palestinians could get even remotely organized they could affect more change than they currently are. This is idealistic, that much I know, but it needs to start somewhere, right?
              </span>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               I've been here for a month now and I have to say, despite all this, the kids are great and I have grown to love them. I want to be there for them and see them through to the end, but alas, I cannot. If these kids become the future leaders of Palestine, I will be glad to have played my part.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               I'll leave this post with a quote from Norman Finkelstein, when asked what we (as Canadians) can do to help. he said "Organize, organize, organize.... and put and end to this madness."
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               I believe this quote is applicable not only for organizing against occupation, but also, one day, God willing, Palestinians will take this message to heat and at least try to organizr themselves!\\
              </span>
              <br/>
              <br/>

               Ok, ok, so it took me a long time to get this posting up, and for that I apologize, but I wouldn't be doing my 2 day adventure in Jerusalem justice by including it in another post. As I said before, Jerusalem is a wonderful, magical and terrible place all at the same time.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               My first taste of the city was entering through Damascus gate, one of the 5 gates into the old city. Little did I know that about 2 hours before my arrival, at Jaffa gate not to far from where I entered, there were reports that an orthodox Jewish man shot an Arab on his way to work. With Jews, Arabs, Christians and Muslims all living side by side inside the cramped walls of the old city, its sometimes easy to forget that east Jerusalem is also illegally occupied. While I was there, staying at a lovely hotel in occupied east Jerusalem, the Israelis decided it would be fair and reasonable to issue demolition orders to a Palestinian kindergarten so that they could build a 4 star hotel, which constitutes another settlement. So much for the land for peace argument. But once again I digress.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               I arrived at the Hashimi hotel in the old city, exhausted from our ridiculous and somewhat violent journey from Nablus. It seemed like an oasis in the middle of chaos. I was sold on the place when I went up to the roof top and saw the view of the old city... "wow!" I thought to myself, "what an amazing place! all the history and all the turmoil! I can't believe I'm actually here!" Again, my thoughts went immediately to my Palestinian friends who cannot go there. The view from the roof top was the stuff of postcards, the iconic view of the Al-Aqsa mosque which dominates the old city sky line screamed out to me. I felt a sense of peace come over me. This sense of peace was soon to be chewed up, spit out, stomped on, reformed, and then chewed up and spit out again. I can best describe my experience in Jerusalem as schizophrenic.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               After feeling so refreshed and at peace, I left the hotel to walk around the narrow streets of the old city. I first went to the Church of the Holy
              </span>
              <b style="font-family: arial;">
              </b>
              <span style="font-family: arial;">
               Sepulchre, the site that christians believe to be the tomb and crucifixion of Jesus, where a beautiful church has been constructed. I was amazed at the energy of the place and the peacefulness of it. I was happy to be there, and took it all in, the sites, the smell of incense, the variety of Christian groups represented there from all across the world, definitely a special place. After touring around the church with peace in my heart, I emerged outside to find an Israeli soldier standing in the court yard fully armed. This broke my heart. "This shouldn't be a place where there are soldiers with guns!" I thought to myself. I know that may sound naive, but seriously people, this is a place of worship. Him being there just reminded me of the obscenity of the system that exists here.
               <br/>
               I walked up and stood beside the soldier, I stood there in silence for a moment before I turned to him and said... "I don't like it that you have a gun in this place.." I'm not even sure if he understood me, he just gave me a weird look and carried on. I left the church square with only some of my peace remaining.
               <br/>
               From there, I went and found a quiet little cafe in the Muslim quarter run by a wonderful Palestinian man. I was the only one there, so he sat with me. We drank tea for what had to be at least 2 hours and talked about all issues ranging from politics to religion. It was wonderful, my peace was once again restored to full strength. This wasn't to last long. As I was returning to the hotel, I watched as soldiers picked out some young arab men out of a crowd and began harrassing them and asking them all sorts of questions, something I was too see multiple times in the next couple of days. This was hard for me to see. "Is this not their home?" I thought. "But they weren't even doing anything, just walking!" I felt saddened and angered by this at the same time. Even in this holiest of cities these people are not allowed to exist. I felt very down for the rest of the day and decided to stay at the hotel and hang out on the roof all night while some of the other teachers went out of the old city to the trendy cafe and bar district of Jerusalem. Something inside just did not feel comfortable going out to those places. I had an evening of introspection on the roof top with a few that people are literally willing to kill for. I was glad to spend a quiet evening by myself, but couldn't shake the sadness. I went to sleep that night with a heavy heart hoping and praying that I would have a better day tomorrow.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The next morning I awoke feeling no better than the day before, I had to deal with some personal issues that morning which only served to compound my feelings of sadness. I decided to suck it up though and headed out to tour and take in more of the old city, hitting up the usual tourist and pilgramage sites. Throughout the day I saw more of the same, young Palestinians being harrassed by soldiers simply due to the fact that they were Palestinian! I couldn't take it anymore! I went back to the hotel and went back to my oasis of peace on the rooftop. That night, I decided to venture out with the other teachers to the cafe and bar area, I figured that despite my sad mood, I should really check it out and see the other side. Looking back, I'm glad I went, but it was generally not a pleasant experience for me. Sitting at one of the cafes smoking sheesha I thought to myself, "This feels like I'm in southern france or something... but I'm not in southern france!" Everything about that area screemed the West, Western music, Western clothing, Western people. The only word I could think of was 'colonial', and I couldn't shake that feeling. I was reminded of where I was only by the occasional soldier and average citizen strolling around with assault rifles on their backs. It reminded me of being out in the backcountry in Canada where some people carry rifles to protect themselves in case of bear attacks. This idea was only furthered in my head by the fact that the conversations I overheard (in english obviously) were people talking about the Palestinians as if they were animals. Sitting there, I began to cry, it was all too much for me, and I had to get out of there.
               <br/>
               We left the trendy cafes and returned to the old city and decided to go visit the famous and historic Western Wall, or the "wailing wall" as its better known as. For those of you who are unaware of this place or its significance, here's a post that'll explain it for you. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall
               <br/>
               It was about midnight as we made our way through the windy streets of the old city towards the Western wall, and upon entering the compund, we had to go through airport style security. "Fair enough" I thought to myself. "This is supposed to be a place for all nations to worship at afterall, so it should be heavily protected as there are definitely crazy people in this city (reference 'Jerusalem Syndrome' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_syndrome). Once through security we approached the wall, and could feel the energy of the place. I thought it was amazing! This place for all nations! I soon found that I really was not very welcome there after all. People were just staring at me, and some began circling us and asking aggressively if we were Jewish.. "What the hell is these peoples problem?!" I thought to myself, "I thought all were welcome here." Some of the orthodox people there clearly did not want us to be there, so we decided to leave. I left feeling angry and upset, and sad with the realization that all this crap over here was never going to end. Needless to say I was depressed. That was really my final memory of Jerusalem and it left a very sour taste in my mouth. The next morning we made our way back to Nablus, where as I said in my last post, I felt relief and some happiness upon arrival.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I'm sure I'm missing so much, but my senses were overwhealmed there, and although its a beautiful place and I plan to go back before I leave (although I'm not sure why exactly, lol), it only served to re-enforce in my mind the obscenity of what is going on over here, and the almost oblivious nature of the Isrealis that I met. They are not evil people, far from it, but I kept thinking to myself. "Do they understand what they are doing to these people??! (palestinians)." In my mind, I don't get how you can deny reality that is shoved down your throat everyday, but many of them seem to have mastered such a skill.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I think going next time will be easier, just cause I know what to fully expect this time.
               <br/>
               I just noticed how bad my english is getting.. I'm tired and need to go to bed..
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Feel free share your thoughts with me on this, as I'm still trying to figure it all out myself.
               <br/>
               Good night and good luck to you all.. may God be with all of you.

               I spent the last 2 days in Jerusalem, which is quite the place to say the least. Jerusalem is a world of extremes and mental universes that are so far apart, that you'd think you've arrived on a new planet just by walking a couple hundred metres. Like I had briefly mentioned in my last posting, the journey there was not easy.

              <br/>
              <span style="font-family:arial;">
               We had arrived at the
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">

               , and were waiting in line when it happened. The 12 year old kid in front of us had just gone through, and the soldier then waved to us indicting that we should come through. As we began to walk towards him, the boy stopped, pulled out what had to be a 12 inch blade and sunk it fully into the soldiers shoulder. The soldier turned around quickly and cocked his assault rifle as other soldiers came running down. I began backing up quickly, not knowing exactly what was going on, at this point all hell seemed to break loose, with shots being fired and people running from the checkpoint. This was apparently in reaction to settler attacks on Palestinian villagers and farmland which they have set ablaze each of the last 3 days. The settlers are angry at the dismantling of some of their outposts which Israel deems illegal, (ignoring the fact that according to International law, all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal), and the bat shit insane cowards decide to take out their frustrations on local villagers, which naturally provokes a response, hence the likely reason for the stabbing at the checkpoint.

               We ended up having to take back roads all the way to

               and it took about 3 times as long as it should have, but we got through, and made it to Jerusalem where most Palestinians can never go. There was even a 14 year old girl who was rejected at an illegal checkpoint leading into East Jerusalem, and she broke down in tears because she was so excited to go. There was a part of me that did not want to go for that very reason, why should I be allowed to go there and they're not? Just another brick in the apartheid wall so to speak. Arriving into the old city of Jerusalem (Al-

                Quds

               ) it at first seemed like an oasis in the middle of a depressing yet beautiful world. I learned quickly that in Jerusalem, you can find heaven and hell in matter of steps. The Jerusalem experience deserves its own posting though, so more to come later on that.

                Nablus
               </span>
               was tense. In the few days we had been there, settlers had attacked Palestinian villagers and burned olive groves. While in Jerusalem I learned that the area around
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">
                Nablus
               </span>
               had been declared a closed military zone, and I thought, shit! How am I supposed to get back in?! As I learned more about it, I learned that it had been closed off to Journalists and Israeli human rights activists. particularly a group called "Checkpoint Watch." Interesting that a supposed beacon of democracy in the middle east would ban journalists and human rights watchers from an area, but we saw the same thing in Gaza 6 months earlier, so it wasn't a surprising move. The whole idea of democracy in Israel is apparently becoming more and more of a joke, just having elections does not make one's state a democracy. Anyway, I digress.

               </span>
               was fairly tense, settlers were lining the sides of the roads, just making their presence known, and of course, these insane criminals were being protected by the army. I've discovered that these are the only people that scare me here, them and the orthodox
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">
                jews
               </span>
               in Jerusalem, some of the most unfriendly and aggressive people I have ever encountered. Despite all of this, we arrived back in
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">
                Nablus
               </span>
               without a hitch, and I was shocked to feel relieved at arriving into
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">
                Nablus
               </span>
               , the people, the sounds, the sights, were all very comforting.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family:arial;">
               Since being back, things have been relatively quiet. Sometimes I can hear the almost nightly raids into the

               refugee camp, but the settlers seemed to have calmed down for now, and the checkpoints have been opened 24hours a day, with little to no interference from soldiers.
              </span>
              <br/>
              <span style="font-family:arial;">
               It is a world of extremes here, and schizophrenic politics where on any given day, policy and practice at the checkpoints can change.

              <br/>
              <span style="font-family:arial;">

               Today I made the trip to Jerusalem and witnessed humanity at its ugliest. I'm tired now, but I'll give the full story tomorrow. Its starting to get tense in Nablus, really tense. Things from this point are likely to escalate. I was at a checkpoint today about to go through when a kid stabbed a soldier, then all hell broke lose. 4 villagers were shot by settlers and olive groves were burned. This are ramping up.

               "You've got to be kidding me!" I thought to myself as more started being fired off the bottom of the jet, right above my neighbourhood too mind you. I quickly realised that they were just shooting flares and so was quickly relieved of my almost heart attack. This continued for a couple hours and then stopped suddenly, Intimidation was done for the day, or so I thought.....
               <br/>

               At around 830pm Adam (American teacher) and I ventured off into the old city to go for a stroll and find some

               . We found a great place near the old souk, and as I looked around me I could see "

               brigades flapping in the evening breeze. After enjoying a lovely

               </span>
               . I stayed outside to have a cigarette and enjoy the quiet and cool air of the beautiful
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">
                nablus

               evening. I realised last night that my place is about 3 or 4 km from an Israeli military camp, but nevertheless, the quiet of the night was contemplative. Suddenly, the power was cut to the whole city and and nervous quiet fell over the city for a few minutes.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "What do you think is going on?" I asked one of the teachers who had been here for awhile.
               <br/>
               "Its Israeli time." she replied with a somewhat sarcastic tone.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Not ten seconds after she said that, a flurry of activity began. Cars began driving en
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">
                masse
               </span>
               up my street at high speed, dogs were barking, and I could see spotlights and other activity on the hill side leading up to the
               <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">
                samaritan
               </span>
               village. After of few minuted of this, silence once again fell over the city, and in the distance, I could hear a brief exchange of fire, followed by more silence.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Despite nothing really big happening that night, I realised that silence is almost as tense as the raids themselves. Sitting and waiting in the dark knowing that pretty much anything could happen at anytime is a strange feeling for me. Silence is the secondary enemy I chuckled to myself. Silence and darkness allows ones imagination to go to some very dark places. All of this in just a few days makes me feel that much more respect for the people here who have taken it for so long, and are still willing to stand up for themselves, and continue to live their lives despite the obscenity of the system that is imposed on them.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So many thoughts, so many things to say already.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               PS: The kids at the school are insane little bastards, but so awesome, I love them already.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               More to come, stay tuned...........

               My initial plan was to head to Jerusalem to spend the night there, but as we all well know, plans can change rather quickly. The new directive was to head to the Arab bus station in East Jerusalem and then take the bus to Ramallah where my colleagues would meet me and escort me to Nablus. I was almost giddy at the thought of going to Jerusalem.. I thought to myself, "I'm really going to Jerusalem..." which made me chuckle a little. Unfourtunately, because I was just passing through to the bus station, I didn't actually see much in the way of Jerusalem, although it was friday so there were lots of orthodox jews and others out and about strolling the streets. Arriving at the bus station I strangely felt a sense of comfort. I have to thank my arab friends for that for preparing me over the years.. thanks guys and girls!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I was wandering around the bus station looking for my bus when I heard a man's voice yell out "Ramllah?!"
               <br/>
               "yes sir!" I replied. And with that I was off!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               As we approached the border, I caught my first glimps of the wall. I found it to be very surreal driving along side of it, and the symbolism which it holds. The word seperation and apartheid kept coming up in my head as we drove along side the wall towards Ramallah. So many thoughts and feelings were running through my head. From anger to ellation, from sadness to excitement, the whole range of human emotions were there.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Ramallah was quiet being that it was a friday, which probably made things easier for me. After meeting up with some of the other teachers, we strolled around the city for a bit, and then headed off to catch a mini-bus to Nablus.
               <br/>
               All I can say is that its beautiful here, the valleys and hills, and most of all the people.
               <br/>
               I'm really looking forward to my time here, and I know I will learn a lot.
               <br/>
               I'm feeling a little ADD right now, so I will post about my event filled first night in Nablus a bit later, all I'll say for now, is that Nablus is beautiful and vibrant despite years of being surrounded and cut off.
               <br/>
               Until the next time folks

               Well, I made it. The journey over was long and disorienting but well worth it.
               <br/>
               Arriving at the customs counter I was more relaxed than I thought I would be.
               <br/>
               "Hello, what is the purpose of your visit to Israel?" asked the customs officer.
               <br/>
               "tourism" I answered, "where are you from by the way?" I think I asked that because she was visibly African and I was partly thrown off by that.
               <br/>
               She looked at me like 'why the hell are you asking me that question!?' At this point things were going smoothly, or at least it seemed like it to me.
               <br/>
               "where will you be staying?" I paused for a moment trying to remember the story I was supposed to use.
               <br/>
               "ahh.. The Notre Dame Guest House!" I quickly answered. At this point it was like anyother experience I've had with customs officers all around the world.
               <br/>
               At that point she moved to stamp my passport and that's where I stopped her.
               <br/>
               "uhh.. excuse me miss, but would it be possible to get the stamp on a seperate piece of paper?"
               <br/>
               Her tone then changed immediately.
               <br/>
               "why?" she asked in a stern voice
               <br/>
               "well.... I wanted to go study in Malaysia in the fall, and to be honest, I really want to go check out Syria and Lebanon after my time in Israel.."
               <br/>
               At this point she just stared at me in silence.
               <br/>
               "Why would you want to go to Lebanon and Syria?"
               <br/>
               At this point, she asked me to go into the back room for further questioning...
               <br/>
               Great....
               <br/>
               Thankfully I was only back there for 15 minutes or so, and the same questions were repeated to me. At the end of the repeated and redundant conversation, the customs officer looked at me with a look of what I can only describe as disdain and said...."well, you'll have to go to Lebanon another time!" and with that, she stamped my passport and let me go.
               <br/>
               Thankfully I had contacted the Canadian Embassy before leaving and they said that they could issue me a temporary passport to go..
               <br/>
               And with that, I was officially allowed into Israel.
