     WHAT turns you on? What turns you off? You probably already know the answers to these questions, so they are not really that important. However, do you know what, in essence, turns on (interests, excites, inspires, motivates, thrills) others with whom you associate? Further, do you know what, in essence, turns off (bores, tires, upsets, hurts) these same individuals? You should know both the "turn-on's" and the "turn-off's" of all signs if you aspire to improve and smooth out your interpersonal relationships generally. That's the purpose of this article -- to give you insight into all of the signs of the zodiac relative to the types of motivations, actions, and approaches which work well and those which may not.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Apply the information which follows as far as you have astrological information about the individuals with whom you wish to or have to relate for whatever reason or reasons -- and to the degree that you feel the relationship merits the effort.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you know only the Sun-Sign, then work with this, as it connects very directly with the inner self of that person; if you also know the ascendant, all the better, as this relates to that individual's outer self and how he or she communicates with the immediate environment. Further usefulness and application can be gained if you also know which other signs are accented by planetary placements and concentrations in the native's individual birth-chart.

     Aries Turn-ON'S
    </font>
    : Arians, being aggressive, action-oriented, often impatient, and at times even a bit impulsive, find any sort of delay or postponement almost impossible to bear -- at least, it is safe to say that they do not like to wait.  So do what you promise when you promise if you want to please them. You should never stand too firmly in their way as they move headlong through life. They are normally regarded as being rather combative or even scrappy, as they seem to relish a challenge or dare; but it must be remembered that they enjoy only those contests and battles in which they win or are relatively certain that the odds are stacked in their favor. If they suspect that challengers are more expert then they, no contest will be held. They will simply not find the time or make up another excuse, but will never admit the real reason for the decline -- that they are afraid they might lose. Keep them turned on by allowing them to win often, and never force them to compete when it is obvious that they do not want to "fight." Allow them to save face.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="red">
     Aries Turn-OFF'S
    </font>
    : Arians are very turned off if they can't be "firstest with the mostest." They lose interest when you see and then talk about movies first, when you get in front of them in any way -- whether it be financially, educationally, or emotionally -- or when you get in front of them in a line or even while out walking. Of course, there is no reason to keep you from forging ahead of them in some areas of life; but it is most important that you don't boast or brag too much about your greater achievements and successes around them if you want to remain close friends. Remember, even though they do tend to forgive quickly, seldom do they forget any type of put-down or the fact that you do not regard them praiseworthy enough to be at the very top of your "admiration list."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="brown">
     Taurus Turn-ON'S
    </font>
    : Whether it be gold, cash, other objects of real and tangible value, services actually performed, or whatever else represents actual wealth, quality and worthwhile services, you'll very likely find that Taurus natives are highly pleased (turned on, if you will) by the object, article, or service, or the prospect of making it theirs. Turn the second-house sign on with a gift; promises mean little to them. If you doubt this, try this simple experiment: Offer to reward a very young Taurus child either with a coin (regardless of its value) or the offer of a kiss and a hug in exchange for doing a simple task. You will most likely find that the child will select the coin in preference to the promise of the less tangible representations of affection. The sign Taurus has an affinity with the throat and with the appetites; therefore, Taureans are very much turned on by the promise and offer of appetite satisfaction, whether it is good food, fine wine, sexual pleasure, or whatever else is pleasing to the "tastes." Prepare a good meal, serve a good cocktail, and dress in an alluring manner if you really want to turn Taurus friends on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="brown">
     Taurus Turn-OFF'S
    </font>
    : These second-house natives are very much turned off by just about anything that is poorly made, of inferior quality, or shoddy and lacking in any way -- this applies to material things, of course, but also to less tangible things, such as love, friendship, and cooperation. To keep their interest, all things -- both tangible and intangible -- must, according to their possibilities, look, sound, smell, feel, and taste good. Always use your best china when Taureans come to dinner. Literally, give these natives the most comfortable chair, out of drafts, the one with the best view. In short, if you want to get on famously with them, make them feel comfortable--this demonstrates your love.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="#999999">
     Gemini Turn-ON'S
    </font>
    : Keep Mercurial Geminians totally involved, completely busy and they are likely to be or to remain turned on. This is not always an easy job; but if you can do it, it may prove quite worthwhile if they mean that much to you. Communication also turns on these natives, but it is perhaps better if you allow them to do most of the talking. Lively conversation, regardless of whether or not it really leads anywhere, is very appealing to members of this third-house sign.  However, the new and most current subjects, even a bit of gossip now and then, normally fascinate these naturally curious natives. Geminians are also quite pleased if you will suggest places to go and will accompany them on these excursions. Always be on the lookout and point out anything interesting along the way which perchance they might not notice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="#999999">
     Gemini Turn-OFF'S
    </font>
    : If you would avoid turning off Gemini friends, whatever your relationship, you will make certain that the relationship is never lacking in newness and variety, for a repeat of the same old things and approaches -- the same greetings, same conversation topics, going to the same places, seeing the same friends, playing the same games -- tends to bore them to the point of  actually getting on their nerves. In essence, sameness and routine are Gemini people's really big turn-offs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="blue">
     Cancer Turn-ON'S
    </font>
    : The feeling and obvious presence of security really turns on these fourth-house and water-sign natives. Having a place which is, in the classical sense, a home is most important to Cancerians. If you would please them, keep this most important fact in mind. Help them to find, maintain, or improve their "nest"; make them feel most welcome, comfortable, and at home in your own residence when they came to visit. You can keep Cancer natives turned on forever if you never lose sight of the message contained in any variation on an old saying: The way to a Cancer native's heart is through the stomach. Prepare and serve a good meal or allow Cancerian friends the pleasure of preparing something to please your palate. Be certain that you are not remiss in offering your sincere compliments about their culinary expertise. In addition, you can earn "points" by saying nice things, even bragging about their family and home as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="blue">
     Cancer Turn-OFF'S
    </font>
    : If you-would avoid turning off members of this sensitive sign, you must never take away anything either emotionally or materially meaningful, even temporarily. To do so is comparable to removing a stone from the foundation of a building -- everything may fall in. Be guardful in what you say because your words, however unintentionally, might be nearly as painful as flaming arrows. You should realize that Cancerians normally must work very hard at maintaining their overall sense of security, and unkind or thoughtless comments can cause them to withdraw quickly into their protective "shell" for fear that some additional "damage" will be done to their self-image (security). Never criticize their mother or other  members of their family.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="red">
     Leo Turn-ON'S
    </font>
    : Perhaps the key technique to turning Leo people on is praise, praise, and more praise. There is little else that natives of this fifth-house sign appreciate more. While it is true that you may tire of looking for things about Leo acquaintances to compliment, finding them can pay great dividends if you aspire to have these individuals in your corner when you need them. Leo folks are turned on by pleasure and by pleasant people; so it may be best not to plan activities with them if you are in a bad mood, negative, or not up to par generally. They are very appreciative of youth and concepts of youthfulness. You are dear to them when you think, act, and feel as young as you possibly can. Not only will you please these fire-sign people, but you will also do yourself a favor when you encompass young thoughts and ideas regardless o your chronological age. Remember, too, that your Leo associates are also turned on by creativity, whether it is your own or someone's you both know. Your notice of their creativity and imagination is always appreciated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="red">
     Leo Turn-OFF'S
    </font>
    : In essence, the term turn-off  quite vividly describes what Leo natives can hardly tolerate -- that's turning off the spotlight when they are basking in its warm rays, something you must never do if you would avoid their wrath. Members of this fifth-house sign cannot long tolerate those who constantly or repeatedly attempt to upstage them. Leo, "the Lion," king of the jungle (house, shop, office, etc.), will surely roar in strong defiance if anyone seriously threatens their right to rulership of their kingdom. In short, if you would get along famously with Leo people, give them the leading role; at best, you may not get more than a good supporting part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="brown">
     Virgo Turn-ON'S
    </font>
    : You will turn Virgoans on if you are neat, clean, punctual, trustworthy, a hard worker, and as nearly perfect as you can be. It is a tall order, but members of this sixth-house sign are normally not asking you for one whit more than they are willing to try to give or do for you. Virgo natives find it next to impossible either to understand or tolerate anything or anybody who is not living up to their potential -- or, at least, striving very hard to do so. They will assist you; but you must be willing to follow their suggestions and teachings which often sound more like criticism than helpful, loving advice and constructive guidance. Your Virgo associates are also quite pleased when you notice and comment favorably on their work, but you must be certain that your compliments are not made up or you will do more harm than good.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font color="brown">
     Virgo Turn-OFF'S
    </font>
    : Avoid any criticism of your Virgo associates if you wish to keep from turning them off totally. It may seem unfair not to be able to criticize the sign known for criticism, but you must remember that people born under this Mercurial sign in no serious way regard themselves as lacking in faults. As a matter of fact, they are inclined to be so totally aware of their own lack of perfection that they can stand very little criticism from others and still maintain any satisfactory degree of self-respect. Let Virgoans be of service to you or they will likely be very disappointed indeed, as people of this sixth-house sign like to work and to serve others in a constructive and meaningful way. Never allow Virgoans to feel unneeded or unnecessary, for this will certainly turn them off in a hurry.

      Libra Turn-ON'S
     </font>
     : Surround your Libra associates with beauty--beautiful objects in good taste; beautiful thoughts, ideas, statements; beautiful proposals and projects--and you will keep them generally turned on most of the time. Libra natives are also very much into the concepts of fairness and equality, so you are wise to keep this fact in mind and to make certain that you employ balance and give-and-take when dealing with them. Further, Librans are especially pleased when friends lend an ear to their problems and then offer suggestions and comments as to how they may make better decisions, for making up their mind is not always easy for this "in-the-balance" seventh-house sign. Libra people are also quite thrilled when beloved associates like, approve, and get along well with other dear associates of theirs. Remember, you should be willing to "share" Librans with their other closer ties.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="#999999">
      Libra Turn-OFF'S
     </font>
     : Strive always to be definite and decisive when dealing with those who are Libra-born, since hardly anything frustrates them more than to sense a pronounced indecisiveness in their friends. They do not want to be troubled with having to make your decisions for you, as they have too much difficulty in trying to make their own. Never be gross or vulgar with or when around members of this Venus-ruled sign or its cardinal nature may express itself with a rather sharp and pronounced disapproval which may seem somewhat out of characer for these normally easy-going natives of the sign of "peace." Librans are very much turned off by those associates who neglect basic neatness in personal appearance and in other areas of their lives as well. Librans' Venus rulership is inclined to disapprove untidiness of all types.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="blue">
      Scorpio Turn-ON'S
     </font>
     : Find out what it is that they really want and help to get it for Scorpio people; you will really turn on members of this eighth-house sign in that way. It is quite ordinary for Scorpio natives to expect measurable results and benefits from any and all partnerships and associations. At times, you may not like the rather demanding nature of Scorpio friends, but only you can decide if what you get from these relationships is worth all the effort and trouble. Scorpio individuals are quite pleased if you understand, approve, and perhaps even appreciate the fact that they do have rather fixed ideas and opinions about most matters. Also appreciated is your further realization that they can't long tolerate anyone hounding them to change. In fact, they adore it when you are patient with them. If your relationship is in any way sexual, don't forget that sex is one of Scorpio's really big turn-ons.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="blue">
      Scorpio Turn-OFF'S
     </font>
     : Scorpio natives are turned way off by any associates who are "floating" -- lacking in determination and direction as to where they are going and what they really want out of life. Scorpio people believe that one should make up his mind as to what he wants, make his goals definite and clear-cut, take those goals and turn them into burning desires, and then fan those desires until they become a part of one's inner being so that, in time, they will be realized. Scorpio natives are strongly desire-motivated and are quite put out by anyone who criticizes them for seeking the fulfillment of those desires-especially those which are sexual in nature.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="red">
      Sagittarius Turn-ON'S
     </font>
     : Help Sagittarius friends to grow, to cover more ground, to expand and you will be in control of the key which turns these fire-sign members on. They really appreciate it very much if you will trouble yourself enough to look after what they would call the "small details" many of which are not really that small, in fact. Another big turn-on for Sagittarius persons is discussing various religious beliefs, philosophical concepts and outlooks with close associates. They will appreciate it very much if you are knowledgeable in these areas and are prepared to have a little verbal contest to defend your position and beliefs now and again. If possible, aid Sagittarians in getting out of town, in traveling often either by helping in the planning or going with them and looking after things for them. People of this ninth-house sign are also turned on by talk about your travels. They also love telling you about their longer trips -- if you will listen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="red">
      Sagittarius Turn-OFF'S
     </font>
     : Possibly nothing turns Sagittarius people off faster than having to deal with those who are dull and glum, lacking in a sense of humor. You will have to smile at times when you may not want to, even when it "hurts" a little. Try smiling more often; you might get to like it. Neither do Sagittarian friends particularly care for those who are small thinkers, those who limit their horizons and prospects. Think big, get the big picture, delve into the overall dream, envision the broad prospects and you'll avoid turning off members of this Jupiter-ruled sign. You'll run the risk of displeasing those of this long-distance sign if you are not willing to drop everything and go with them on an out-of-town trip when the notion strikes them. Never say you can't afford the trip, as this sign just doesn't like to be bothered with such "trivia" as this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="brown">
      Capricorn Turn-ON'S
     </font>
     : These natives are turned on by anyone who will actually aid them in any practical way to climb the ladder of success, to get ahead in realistic ways. You may do this by offering advice, by doing business with them, and through proper introductions to others who can help. Capricornians also appreciate those who understand their propensity to be too negative at times and those who are eager to assist in helping to motivate, to encourage, and to offer positive suggestions and hope to  Capricorn people's consciousness to higher and more constructive levels. These tenth-house natives appreciate, even demand in their own quiet way, that you show them respect and honor, especially if they hold a high position.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="brown">
      Capricorn Turn-OFF'S
     </font>
     : Capricornians are definitely turned off by anyone who lacks the motivation necessary in order to work toward improving his position in life.This is especially true as it relates to business and reputation. Basically, Capricorn natives are the "salt of the earth" and believe that they and everyone else ought to be "worth their salt." These earth-sign people are turned off if and when those in close association are too open, overt, and aggressive in showing their emotions, especially those that relate to love, sympathy, and sexual interest. These natives often are somewhat cold or slow in showing such feelings and do so only at the "proper" time and place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="#999999">
      Aquarius Turn-ON'S
     </font>
     : These eleventh-house natives are turned on by those who dare to be individuals, those who voice their opinions, those who have the courage to be themselves regardless of what the world in general thinks about them. Therefore, Aquarians like you more if you are not a member of the army of the ordinary. Originality, uniqueness, and aptness of thought all are appreciated by these Uranus-ruled persons. Aquarius friends appreciate those who understand that they often may march to a different drumbeat than that marched to by most others. Perhaps what is really desired is tolerance, since total understanding of this unpredictable sign might be too much to ask of anyone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="#999999">
      Aquarius Turn-OFF'S
     </font>
     : Aquarius people may well be quite turned off if you attempt to get too close to them, too friendly with them. While this might seem out of character for this friend-oriented sign, it is, nonetheless, true. However, Aquarians tend to expect loyalty from their friends and close associates and are totally disillusioned if those in whom they have placed their confidence betray that trust in any real and meaningful way. Aquarians expect you to follow through "as advertised." Aquarians have a rather pronounced inmate desire to be recognized and appreciated for their individuality and uniqueness, and you can turn them off if you attempt to outdo them or grab too much of the glory from them. They demand credit for that which is their own positive doing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="blue">
      Pisces Turn-ON'S
     </font>
     : Help Pisces friends to be more aware of the rhythms of life all about and you will keep them turned on. Have some appreciation for music, art, and other areas of creativity and you will certainly please Pisces people. Natives of this twelfth-house sign often live from brief to long periods of time in their own dream world and will be most happy if you understand this important part of their nature, and are considerate enough not to interrupt their dreams too often or too shockingly with the cold, hard facts of the reality of the here and now. Pisces individuals, while they may not show it very much outwardly, are very turned on when friends notice and compliment them on things of a creative 
nature which they actually accomplish.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <font color="blue">
      Pisces Turn-OFF'S
     </font>
     : You'll turn sensitive Pisces folks off if you can't, at least some of the time, dream along and pretend with members of this Neptune-ruled sign. Don't try to be too much of a factualist, a hard-nosed realist too much of the time if you would endear and enrich your relationship with Pisceans. Avoid inconsistencies in dealing with those of this often rather inconsistent sign. When you are unpredictable, it is very frustrating to Pisces people, as they often find this very part of their own nature so frustrating; they simply can't cope very well with the complex problem of matching or molding two indefinites into anything tangible and meaningful. Pisces natives do not enjoy having things of importance covered up or hidden from them when it is necessary that they know the truth about such matters. While it is true that Pisceans do enjoy surprises, it is best that you keep all surprises on the lighter side.
