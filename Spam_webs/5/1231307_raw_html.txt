       <strong>
        As of March 26th 2014, last.fm stopped their radio streaming! No streaming
whatsover, for no one (no, not even for subscribers). So this project is kind
of pointless now. Ill leave this page here for no apparent reason and the
source will stay on github.com as well, but you wont be able to use it like
you used to. Thanks to all the loyal users and contributors I got to know of
the years, especially those who chilled out with me in #shell-fm! And my very
special thanks to the few of you who actually donated money! I think it was
about 20 EUR over the years, and I spent all of it on beer!

       About
      </h2>
      <p>
       shell-fm is a lightweight, console-based player for
       <a href="http://www.last.fm">
        Last.FM
       </a>
       radio streams. Its pretty small (the binary is
currently about 70K, or about 60K when stripped) and it has most features the
official player has, if not even a few more. Additional features are, for
example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        network interface (control shell-fm remotely)
       </li>
       <li>
        autoban (automatically ban all tracks of an artist you dont like)
       </li>
       <li>
        bookmark stations (quickly jump to bookmarked stations with a single key)
       </li>
       <li>
         probably more
       </li>
      </ul>

       Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
       shell-fm doesnt need much. You definitely need
       <a href="http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/">
        libmad
       </a>
       shell-fm can also use
       <a href="http://xiph.org/ao/">
        libao
       </a>
       for playback (optional).
      </p>
      <h2 id="download">
       Download
      </h2>
      <p>
       I recommend using the latest checkout from the GIT repository.
      </p>
      <pre>
       <code>
        git clone git://github.com/jkramer/shell-fm.git shell-fm
       </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
       GitHub also prepares
       <a href="http://github.com/jkramer/shell-fm/downloads">
        release packages
       </a>
       for you to
download.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might also want to check if theres a package available for your Linux
distribution. However, those packages are maintained by other shell-fm users
and I can not guarantee that theyre up to date and/or working.
      </p>
      <h2 id="installation">

      <h2>
       Usage
      </h2>
      <p>
       Theres an extensive manual in the shell-fm package that should explain
everything.
