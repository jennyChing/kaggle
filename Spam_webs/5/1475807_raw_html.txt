         <em>
          Australia risks losing control of a strategic international issue after Tony Abbott said climate change was off the agenda at this year's G20 summit,
         </em>
        </strong>
        <strong>

        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyone who has ever hosted a dinner party should have some sympathy for the Prime Minister as he prepares to host leaders of the world's 20 largest economies later this year at the G20 Summit in Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Deciding whether to serve fish or chicken might cause some anxiety, but it's the question of what to talk about that will keep even the most experienced host awake at night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Naturally, the Prime Minister wants to steer the conversation towards issues that matter to all G20 members and to avoid topics that aren't relevant, or which it can do nothing about. The promotion of growth through trade that is equitable is most likely to be the main topic at the G20.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the question keeps coming up, why is the Prime Minister so keen to keep
        <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/climate-change-off-g20-agenda-20140604-39jdx.html" target="_self" title="">
         climate change off the agenda
        </a>
        at this year's summit?
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not that he doesn't acknowledge the need for a coordinated international response to climate change - he's long argued that it can only be solved through collective international action.
       </p>
       <p>
        His reasoning is that this is not the right forum for tackling climate change, and the G20 should remain focussed on promoting economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we know that if left unchecked climate change could cause trillions of dollars of damage and lost revenue, affecting business, jobs and the economy. Even a two-degree increase in global temperatures - which we are currently on track to surpass - could shave as much as 2 per cent off the global economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Climate change at its core is an economic and security issue and one global issue that G20 members can do something about.
       </p>
       <p>
        These 19 countries, plus the EU, are responsible for about 80 per cent of the pollution that is causing the earth to warm.
       </p>
       <p>
        The G20 accounts for 85 per cent of the world's economy, which now needs to be steered towards low-pollution wealth creation if we're ever going to get on top of this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister is right to caution against symbolism at the G20, but this is a poor excuse for taking climate change off its agenda. Going beyond symbolism in international affairs relies on strong leadership and skilful diplomacy from those who are leading the negotiations.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no shortage of practical steps the G20 could take to make a real difference to avoid dangerous climate change - for a start, making good on their
        <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2013/11/21/3895364.htm">
         2009 promise
        </a>
        to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the International Monetary Fund, globally, government handouts for fossil fuel production and consumption amount to $1.9 trillion per year. Phasing them out would cut global carbon emissions by about 13 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the implications of climate change for the global economy and the potential for the G20 to make a difference, what's really stopping the Prime Minister from including this issue on the agenda?
       </p>
       <p>
        Some would argue that it doesn't fit with the Government's domestic political agenda, but an often-overlooked feature of the Coalition's climate change position is that it has long argued that domestic policy settings must be calibrated to align with the international context.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the very heart of the Prime Minister's opposition to carbon pricing is an assertion that this approach to cutting emissions is out of step with the international trend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Logically, this means the Government would consider changing this position if other countries showed the lead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister has stepped up his rhetoric in recent days, perhaps because other countries are showing the lead.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the past week, we've seen the US introduce new laws to reduce pollution from power plants by 30 per cent, and signals from China that it is exploring the idea of introducing an absolute national cap on emissions.

        <a href="http://www.wwf.org.au/">
         WWF
        </a>
        , found that while the US, China, Indonesia, EU and Singapore are on track to meet their international carbon pollution targets, Australia is far off track.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EU, US and other G20 countries have expressed a desire for climate change to be on the G20's agenda - so why would Australia, as host, reject these requests? Perhaps it is embarrassing to have the spotlight on the Government's efforts to dismantle Australia's carbon pricing mechanism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is the first country to make such a move, putting us at odds with more than 40 other countries that either have carbon pricing schemes in place now, or plan to have one in the next few years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Explaining this to our international guests could well lead to some uncomfortable dinner conversation. Not only does it make sense for the G20 to act on climate change during this year's summit, it would also be perfectly consistent with the Australian Government's own policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rather than resisting international pressure to include climate change on the agenda, the Government would be better placed addressing the issue head on. Much better to own the issue than run the risk those others will force it onto the agenda. This would be messy and potentially damaging diplomatically.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians are great hosts and the Prime Minister will undoubtedly put on a good show. Does the Government want this year's G20 summit to be remembered for what was not discussed, or as an economic opportunity that was grasped by the world's leaders?

           If WWF is so appalled by the Abbott Government's stance then is should stop taking their money. Show some principle...for once.

             @ Don D'Cruz: Well said.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             For G20 to succeed it must focus on its main agenda. Abbott Govt is right here. The worst thing G20 can do is to allow its main agenda to be hijacked by a controversial issue like climate change.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I think the exploding exponential global population growth at 80,000,000 in one year is a much bigger issue than climate change. So why should climate change be on the G20 Summit agenda when issues on global population are not.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Lord Attenborough and Dick Smith have called the exploding global population the elephant in the room.

                 @ Peter and Bahbet. Thanks for your comments.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 As a graduate student I had the pleasure to listen to a lecture by Paul Ehrlich. Ehrlich was proved wrong by the Green Revolution in food production. Sadly it cannot be repeated.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Four years ago I was the project engineer to grow food in a 54 sq km block in Inner Mongolia, China in the place where Genghis Khan grew up. It is an arid and harsh region. We failed. It is now very very hard to increase food production to match population increases globally.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Sixteen percent of China's agricultural land are poisoned by chemicals. China is going out to Brazil, Africa and Australia to buy up farms. But China has a fair chance to survive the looming critical crisis in Asia before 2050 because of its one child policy.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The critical food crisis will affect 2,000,000,000 in Asia and Africa.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Australia needs to plan for this disaster. I have urged that Australia and USA start planning to have a large military base in Darwin to protect Australia AND US military assets in Australia and US important nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean which are serviced by Australia.

                 Dr BS,
                 <br/>
                 I quote your first post :
                 <br/>
                 "The worst thing G20 can do is to allow its main agenda to be hijacked by a controversial issue like climate change."
                 <br/>
                 The article above on which you are purportedly commenting on is specifically about why the author believes climate change should be on the agenda.
                 <br/>
                 Your second post launches into a  theme which you believe should be on the agenda.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I agree it is an important theme however not one mention of the subject of your choice appears in the above article by Dermot O'Gorman
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The worst thing this forum can do is allow its main agenda ( i.e. the article we are commenting on) be hijacked by some totally unrelated issue

                 Is the beefed up military presence in Darwin to counter China's rise, or to stop the human waves of hungry refugees?

                 You seemed to have mixed up humanitarian crisis with military ones. So should we buy nuclear submarines as well? Should we have nuclear missiles too?

                 @ GrumpiSkeptic. Thanks for your comments.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Please get over the hangover from the riots against Chinese in the Lambing Flat in 1861. Why keep thinking China is the number one potential enemy? China suffered from Japan invasions in 1895 and 1937-1945. From that China would have learned that  it is not cost effective to conquer another nation to gain access to resources.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The risk of war with China for Australia and USA is greatest because of the China and Japan dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Beyond that and with events in Middle East and Eastern Europe spinning out of control for USA it will be in the best interest of USA to pressure the Japan to join China and put the dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands into COLD STORAGE. This is a proven formula used by India and China to manage a bigger dispute over vast territories in the Himalayan Mountains because of historical legacies.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If peace can be achieved between US, Japan and China then US will realize that USA and China are now Siamese Twins in the World Economy and in maintaining global PEACE.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 When Asia descends into total chaos US needs to work with China to provide some peace. In that chaos USA, China, Japan and South Korea will be the natural allies of Australia as they would not like Australia to be conquered by a tsunami of millions of boatpeople as that will threaten their access to the resources of Australia by trade.

                 1) The G20 is an Economic Forum, NOT a Climate Change Forum, though I believe, Global Energy Usage, is on the agenda, which I would have thought is quite significant, given that ever increasing populations, along with improving prosperity in developing countries, such as China and Indonesia, is the real driver of Energy Usage, and COAL is still the cheapest form of base load energy supply, despite the fact that there has been big improvements in solar and wind energy, they still remain inefficient and expensive.  Despite all this, the Looney Greens and their Global Warming Alarmist cohorts, are still shrieking their mantra of the need to increase populations, but, at the same time, expect them to live in the dark, deprived of access to cheap enery, while they reside in their comfortable, airconditioned/heated Ivory Towers, with a fuel guzzling vehicle parked in the garage, lecturing the developing world that they can`t possibly expect to have the same luxuries.  It is the epitome of arrogant, sanctimonious Hypocrsy.
                 <br/>
                 2) The much maligned Diesel Fuel Rebate, a few facts, and an example of why "One Size fits all" therories don`t work in the real world.  Australia`s Coal and Iron Ore Mining, is all carried out in  very isolated areas, as is the majority of our Agricultural Export Industries, particularly Cattle, yes that beautiful clean, economical source of protein, now feeding so much of Asia, which the Green/Labor/Animals Australia fanatics, shut down overnight, and continue to describe as a Toxic Environmental Blight on the landscape, etc etc.  All the development work, and on going operating costs in these industries, is extremely high due to their isolation and distance from markets/ports for export of their products.  The diesel fuel rebate was introduced to try and counter their high cost of an essential item in their business, compared to businesses operating within sight of capital cities.  Remember, these industries are operating anywhere from 500 to 2000 klms from a a capital city or port.  The main point of my argument is this, and it is very rarely mentioned by the critics of this rebate scheme:  The Rebate is ONLY applicable for diesel used OFF ROAD, ie it is NOT ALLOWED for any MAIN ROAD or HIGHWAY TRAVEL.

                 @ Toc. Agree fully. In the long run Ehrlich is correct. In fact the problem in the long run is now worse and the problem is now at a higher scale.

                 What he was proved wrong is the timing of the disaster in front of us.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Australia located in the most dangerous neighbourhood in the World, namely Asia should better prepare to defend itself when chaos descends on Asia.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 @ GrumpiSkeptic:. Yes I support Australia buying a few of the Virginia Class Nuclear Submarines. Our only reliable military Ally is USA and it is logical to use the same military systems. We use US planes.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Also our leaders should sell Australia as an essential and very important ally of US in a global war. We are a large land mass located on the opposite side of the Earth to USA and that is very important. Furthermore we service the nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean can hit targets in Asia and Europe.

                 'Dr' Goh, what are you on about??Are you for real? Climate change is here, the science is there for all to see, except for a delusional few, Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop (alias bubble and squeak), amongst these. The G20 simply must address this issue. Of course I forgot, the Abbott regime does not have a minister for science. And another thing, China's one child policy, ie China's social engineering 'policy', has led to a shortage of females, which in turn has resulted in the kidnapping of females in some areas. One also has to ponder on the future medical problems eg diabetes, that these often spoiled, over fed children of one child families will have. As your illustrious career appears to have placed you in various areas of the public sector(?), how amazing that the Australian government has not listened to you! I cannot understand why Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop (alias bubble and squeak) would not be kindly disposed to your learned pronouncements. Sadly, you sir, are are a rambling, discombobulated example of humanity, unlike passionate, intelligent persons such as David Attenborough and Al Gore who may not be everyone's favourite pin ups, they however have devoted their lives to promoting awareness of our planet and its problems, with a fair dash of humility, unlike your good self.

                 @ Ozziefried. Thanks for your comments.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Please read my comments carefully. Note that I am in favour of truly Cost Effective Strategic Policies in fighting global warming. Also try to understand that in spite of all the abuses thrown at him, PM Abbott does believe in the risks of global warming. If not why would the Abbott Govt spend a few billion dollars in Direct Action to fight global warming.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I never worked for the Govt as a civil servant unless you think being an academic means I was working in the public sector. I was a pioneer in international education and set up the first private university college in Australia in 1987 and my God it was really tough business fighting some leftist Minister of Education in the Hawke Govt and some union bullies who threaten to blackmail our company.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I got my PhD in rocket science in 1967. Specifically it was to develop the mathematics of Strategic Decision Making known as optimal control theory. I was the first person to apply this part of rocket science to the management of fisheries in 1969. I am the leading authority in the subject as described in the review paper by Y Cohen. A review of harvest theory and applications of optimal control theory in fisheries management. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 1987, Vol 44: pp75-83.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 My proposal is:  (i) Australia does nothing within Australia as we are a very very expensive country and a small country people wise and our total CO2 emission is insignificant in the required framework of 30 to 50 years. (ii) Australia spends each year a few billion dollars a year in joint R&amp;D with China and India in nuclear energy and renewable energies. This is our share of the responsibility to fight global warming.  The aim is to moderate and reduce the CO2 emissions of these Asian giants.
                 <br/>
                 Be happy and have a good day in beautiful Australia.

               Dr Goh, 'Exploding exponential global population growth' certainly is a severe issue. The imminent statistics make for grim reading. But with a barely cloaked Catholic agenda alive and well behind the scenes this might be one of the last items to reach the table. Crikey !we are running out of things to talk about. Tea, anyone ?

                 WRONG. In fact, the "imminent statistics" (by "imminent" is assume you mean current) show that global population is set to peak in the next couple of decades and will start to decline slowly thereafter. If there is a population-related issue relating to the economy at the moment it is the looming problem of a global "ageing population" as the population shrinks. Besides, there is very little that we can do to control global population simply because every human being on earth has exactly the same right to be here as every other human being.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But there are things that we can do to fix the really big economic problem that faces us: global warming. And the G20 is the perfect place to discuss this because most of the major contributors to the problem will be attending and the worst offender of all is hosting the conference.

                 Abbott is running scared on climate change. He knows that Australia is becoming a pariah and that he faces a lecture on the subject from nearly any world leader he meets. That's why he refused to meet the head of the World Bank or the head of the IMF during his recent junket to pick up fresh instructions from Uncle Rupert. He knew that they would give him the "rounds of the kitchen" over climate change policy and he was too much of a coward to face the music.

                 Abbott is no coward. He DID meet the head of IMF as well as the Treasury Secretary , Jack Lew, the head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellin, both heads of the Democratic &amp; Republican Parties , Boehmer &amp; nancy Pelosi as well as head of the United Nations &amp; had Dinner with Rupert Murdock. But so what ! so did Kevin Rudd meet Murdock . If you were really so concerned about climate change , you should be against the .
                 <br/>
                 holding a G20 Summit .Look at all the vast amounts of carbon dioxide emissions produced by all the airliners bringing all these delegates .So much hot air    ------    nearly all of them paying lip service to the new religion of  " Climate Change ".

                 Well, he did bump into her during the D-Day celebrations, but that doesn't really count. He also had the opportunity to have a proper meeting in New York, but preferred to meet with Uncle Rupert instead. You can be sure that he got plenty of instructions regarding the changes Uncle Rupert wants to "intellectual property" laws in Australia, that will reinforce Foxtel's monopoly over the Australian market.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Abbott deliberately chooses to meet with ideological fellow-travellers and to avoid meeting with more experienced and capable leaders who are prepared to speak plainly and directly on subjects that make him feel uncomfortable. In my book this is a cowardly attitude. A braver man would face his fears and embrace the opportunity to learn from his betters.

                 <br/>
                 Yes he did. He met lots of tycoons and business leaders, but he still fought tooth and nail to introduce measures to fight climate change (against Murdoch's wishes), to get the task of renewing our ailing telecommunications infrastructure rolling and to begin the task of reforming our school education system. All of these measures were in direct contradiction of Rupert's wishes but, since the election, the Abbott government has made the reversal of these policies it's top priority.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 That's the difference. Rudd had the courage to put Australia first, while Abbott simply dances to Rupert's tune.

                 The government is scared and knows thier policy is crap. The direct action nonsense is the worst policy in the world. Much better to investing $3 billion in renewable energy then pay the big companies not to pollute, how do you even enforce this requirement. Removing a carbon price is a massive step in the wrong direction , China has six states using a carbon price pilot scheme with the aim of a national scheme and absolute natonal cap by the end of the decade, Carlifornia has adopted such a scheme and there is incentive for the US states to independently adopt such schemes following the laws introduced by Obama.
                 <br/>
                 An ETS would be best for Australia , its impact on industires and the economy is overstated, in fact everyone knows that high power bills have a LOT more to do with over investment in power infrastructure than the so called carbon tax.
                 <br/>
                 The dodgy power companies have been wasting money on pwoer infrastructure upgrades that will never be needed.
                 <br/>
                 FAct- the cost of solar photovolatic technolgoy and battery storage is dropping substantitallye very year and it will be not be long when households realize that solar panels and being off grid will save them money.

                 "Much better to investing $3 billion in renewable energy then pay the big companies not to pollute, how do you even enforce this requirement. "
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Well, yes, but the attraction of 'Direct Inaction' for the Tories is the fatal flaw you have pointed out. Abbott is pushing "Direct Inaction" precisely because it cannot be enforced. This will allow him to shell out billions in taxpayers' money to foreign corporations with no obligation on them to do anything at all.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Of course, the beauty of carbon pricing is that it pays for itself, whereas "Direct Inaction" has to be paid for by the taxpayer.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It would be really infuriating if not for the delicious irony of it all. The Tories procliam themselves as the champions of free enterprise and worship "the market" vociferously but, when it comes to actually placing their faith in "the market", they shy away and opt for a heavily interventionist approach. And, despite all of their loud claims of fiscal responsibility, they are prepared to throw away 3 billion dollars of OUR money on untied grants to their corporate sponsors. Meanwhile, the ALP and the Greens, who the Tories characterise as being "anti-market" got on with the job of creating a MARKET-BASED solution that was having significant success in a surprisingly short space of time and was delivered at no cost to the taxpayer.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The Liberal Party claims to be a liberal party dedicated to free enterprise. In fact it is a conservative party addicted to state intervention. The big difference between them and Labor is on whose behalf they intervene, not whether they intervene or not. Labor intervenes on behalf of Australians when the market fails to deliver. The Liberals intervene on behalf of foreign capital in situations where the market forces would produce better results for Australians.

               But you're right, I would agree that the elephant in the room is population growth. It is the core to nearly all of the problems facing our planet today. Acknowledging it doesn't help the looming disaster increased temperatures caused by man made emissions. A large population will magnify any problem human kind may impose on the planet, CO2 emissions is one of the big ones. Abbott needs to show some leadership instead of burying his head in the sand.

                 Yes population growth is the big issue.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The problem of course is that virtually all economic growth models have population growth at it's core.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Until somebody defines and implements an economic model that does not rely on population growth as it's central mechanism emissions will never be effectively addressed.

                 "But you're right, I would agree that the elephant in the room is population growth. It is the core to nearly all of the problems facing our planet today."
                 <br/>

                 STUFF AND NONSENSE.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 First: the world's population is close to its peak and will start to fall within the next few decades.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Second: even if controlling poputlation were a good idea we do not have the capacity to do it, so there is no point in talking about it.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Third: the vast majority of the world problems have as their root the collapse of the world capitalist economy during the 1890's and our subsequent failure to move on to a more rational economic system. By persisting with a system that has already failed catastrophically, we have done immense damage to the planet and caused the worst disasters in human history (WW1, the Great Depression, WW2 and the current, intractible famine affecting Africa and large parts of Asia and South America). We cannot continue. Capitalism killed billions during the 20th Century and we cannot afford a repeat in the 21st.

                 For hard statistics India reported in 2011 its census result. It now has 1,200,000,000 people with 180,000,000 added in the past ten years with no significant decline in growth rate. Soon India will have a population larger than China. Similar growth rates in many Asian and African countries.

                 Actually it is the results of demographic analysis and mathematical rules, and has nothing to do with "speculation", unlike your claim that the world is overpopulated or that population is a major problem.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Before we can say that the world is overpopulated,. we need to be able to say what the maximum sustainable population of the earth is, and nobody can say what this is because there is no one correct answer. The maximum sustainable population of the earth is dependent on the environmental "footprint" of each human being, and this is dependent on how each individual lives. The average citizen of the US or Australia has the same environmental "footprint" as the average Somalian village. So the world has a much smaller carrying capacity for people living like us than it has for people living like Somalis.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Most people who believe the myth that the world is overpopulated live in affluent countries like Australia and the US and, if we are to reduce the population of the world, the obvious place to start would be in these countries, where individuals have the same footprint as an entire African village. So, getting rid of. for example: Dr BS Goh would have the same effect as getting rid of a whole village.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Of course, we can make room for more humans simply by living better and reducing our individual and collective environmental footprints. This seems a much better solution than whatever sort of genocide you are suggesting.

                 I agree, it is a very simple formula. What you are describing is a way of roughly (extremely roughly) reckoning the environmental footprint, expressed in land area, of a human being. The big problem with this is there is no way of figuring out a single, accurate environmental footprint that will work as well for a Somalian as it does for a German, Chinese of US citizen. Each individual has a different environmental footprint resulting from lifestyle choices and life circumstances and the variation in the size of footprints is enormous.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If we based our calculations on the environmental footprint of the average US citizen, the maximum sustainable population of the earth may be less than one billion. But if we base our calculations on the average Somalian or Botswanan citizen's footprint, we may come up with a figure of fifty billion.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So attempting to figure out the carrying capacity of the earth is a totally pointless exercise. There is no way that you could come up with an accurate figure that would mean anything to anyone.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 There is another way of looking at it. If we figured out the size of the "resource pool" available to us, and divide it by th enumber of people inhabiting the earth, we could get a fairly accurate picture of just how large a footprint each of us can afford to cast. I think most of us would be surprised and alarmed.

                 But there is going to be an increase in population and increases per capita of emissions in developing economies with large populations.

                 So perhaps in the interest of relevancy for this particular debate, we should define population increases within the context of developed and developing economies increasing their populations with the resultant increases in emissions, both in total and on a per capita basis in countries such as China and India.

                 Jilleen,
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "Back when we had 3bn or 4bn people we had no where near the same environmental problems we now face."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And yet there were still people who were claiming that the world was overpopulated and that, if we got to five billion we would all be eating each other.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The big problem is that over the past sixty years or so, the world's economy has become progressively more monopolised and the power of transnational monopoly corporations to hold democratically elected governments to ransom has increase exponentially. Not only has this prevented us from taking effective action on climate change and other forms of environmental degradation, it has also fostered the development of an unsustainable consumer society in "advanced" societies, and increasingly among the privileged classes of the third world.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 While the answer to our environmental problems lies in reducing our individual and collective environmental footprint, it is in the interests of the transnational corporations to encourage ever more wasteful and frivolous misuse of non-renewable resources. And, as you can see every time you look around, it is the short term interests of the transnationals that prevail over the long term interests of humanity.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It is not population growth that is the problem, it is the unsustainable growth in consumer demand, driven by corporate propaganda (advertising) that is destroying the planet
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Our experiment with corporate monopoly capitalism has been a dismal failure that now threatens the sustainability of human society. We can't afford to entertain fantasies any more. Time to get back to basics.

                 Capitalism in fact lifted billions out of poverty in the 20th century and killed no-one.  The real killers were the systems of the left (Fascism, Nazism and Communisism) that puit the State at the centre of life at the expense of the individual human being.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Africa continues to suffer from poverty because capitalism can't thrive there, due to its corrollaries, the rule of law and the respect for private property, not being in place.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Capitalism is not a system anyway.  It is merely the human race's default mode of dealing with each other once public order has been enforced. That doesn't mean that commercial dealings don't have to be regulated.  However, it doesn't mean that there is any system that can take the place of what is the natural tendency of human beings to trade for profit.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You should look up Say's law.

                 Peter,
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "Capitalism in fact lifted billions out of poverty in the 20th century and killed no-one."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The three greatest disasters in human history were all the result of the total failure of capitalism during the 1890's.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The First World War killed tens of millions, destroyed vast swathes of Europe's most productive farmland, reduced entire cities to ruins and triggered a global epidemic that killed millions more.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The Great Depression killed an unknown number of people but, if you look at the experience of an affluent country like the US, where seven million are known to have died from famine, it is clear that the global toll was immense.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The Second World War killed hundreds of millions and levelled Europe and most of Asia.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 These three cataclysmic disasters were the DIRECT result of the failure of capitalism, and they have had many consequences that can be seen as indirect results of capitalism's failure in the 1890's. Of course, the most serious of these is anthropogenic climate change, and it is the dominance of our society and politics by transnational corporations (a product of decaying capitalism) that is preventing us from taking the action we need to take.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The death toll from human-induced climate change is difficult to estimate, but it is already clear that a growing trend of heat-related deaths around the world is not an historical blip, but an entrenched tendency resulting from higher temperatures being experienced by human beings.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But the biggest killer of all has been the intractable famine that has gripped large parts of the world and half of the world's population for well over half a century. We are talking about hundreds of millions of lives lost without good reason here.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The only places in which poverty has fallen significantly are in Latin America, and the falls recorded have been so significant that they have resulted in a reduction of the world poverty rate despite poverty increasing in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and so on. But these impressive results are not the result of capitalism - quite the reverse, in fact. It is only since the Latin American nations in question abandoned neo-liberalism for social-democratic and socialist security that significant inroads into poverty have been achieved.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I am afraid that your parroting of empty ideology is no substitute for cold, hard facts.

                 .... if you think Nazism and fascism are elemetns of the left you shouldn't bother to embarass yourself on the public forum. Even taking into account some of Hitler's left leaning economic polcies , fascism and rampant militarism and nationalism are hall marks of the extreme far right. Surely you realize this.
                 <br/>
                 No one is arguing capitalism is evil, a mixed economy is what most economist agree is the optimal system in an imperfect world. Surely you recognise that the complete free market is inherently flawed and needs regulation to correct negative externalities and market fialures. think of this, without a government there would be no army provided by private firms, without contract laws how can any business be done in a free market society.

                 Most of us would consider getting one out of three right as a failure. We would certainly avoid advertising our ignorance in a public forum such as this.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Fascism is a RIGHT-WING philosophy that has its ideological roots in romantic interpretations of the purity of Roman martial society. As an fundamentally authority-based system of thought, it lies at the extreme end of right-wing politics.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Nazism is a regional variant of fascism that arose in Germany during the 1920's and was carefully nurtured, financed and equipped by RIGHT-WING fanatics including Prescott Bush (that's right, George HW's daddy and Dubbya's granddaddy) and George H Walker (George HW's maternal grandfather and Dubbya's great-granddaddy). Hitler's fascination with the faux-science of eugenics has it's roots in Walker's efforts in breeding race-horses and his cock-eyed dream of breeding a master-race of humans.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Communism is a theoretical (for now) social system that is the result of a long and deliberate process of socialist development. It is the culmination of a school of rational thought (dialectics) that evolved in pre-Socratic Greece and its preference for reason over authority places it on the left of the political spectrum. Of course as one of the features of communist society is that it is stateless and classless, the idea that communism has anything to do with promoting the primacy of the state is obvious nonsense.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I suggest that you expand your reading out from the backs of cereal boxes and learn a little about various political philosophies before shooting your mouth off. There are a number of excellent texts that can help you, but you won't have time to read them if you spend your time making silly and ignorant posts.

                 <br/>
                 Sir, one would hope that this is not your real name for certainly, with your assertion that Fascism and Nazism are system of the left, you do all real lawyers by the name of of Peter a grave injustice.
                 <br/>
                 Is this attempt to attribute all of the historical wrongs of the extreme right as being of the left what you would call evidence?
                 <br/>
                 Perhaps in a court of law you would be able to argue that 2+2=5 and perhaps there are those who would believe if you sounded convincing enough.
                 <br/>
                 I quote your earlier post:
                 <br/>
                 "I am an expert at evaluating evidence in the hardest school of all, the legal system. I have looked at the evidence, and I have to say that if it went beofre a court the climate alarmists would lose. " (the typo is yours)
                 <br/>
                 I would suggest that what you are saying in that quote is also a fallacy and that lawyers are nothing more than mercenaries of the legal system that care not whether their client is guilty or innocent.  They only seek to convince the court otherwise for a fee.
                 <br/>
                 To say you have looked at the evidence and believe that it would not stand up in a court has no significance in this debate here for surely better lawyers would try this that being the case.
                 <br/>
                 I am afraid I must dismiss your profession to be an "expert" with the description:  'x' = an unknown quantity    spurt = a drip under pressure
                 <br/>
                 I don't understand what motivates people like you to present yourself as being the only spoken truth but you do your argument a grave injustice.
                 <br/>
                 Attempts at re-writing history as you have done here brandish all the hallmarks of the propaganda machinery utilised by, as you called them, "Fascism, Nazism and Communisism" (again, your typo)

                 If world population had stayed at 1900 levels, there would have been no need to lift billions out of poverty as there were not billions of us here. So only a few hundred million were in dire need of lifting out of poverty.
                 <br/>
                 Now it's a lot harder.
                 <br/>
                 We now have as many people approximately, living around about as well as we do in Australia, as the whole of the Earth's human population only 114 years ago.
                 <br/>
                 The rest would like lifting out of poverty and who can blame them.
                 <br/>
                 The fossil fuels needed to do it, don't exist and we couldn't afford to burn them if they did.
                 <br/>
                 That's the elephant.
                 <br/>
                 When the disaster has happened, I hope the survivors have enough left of our technological society to rebuild a sensible, rational technological society.

                 Peter,
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "Capitalism is not a system anyway. It is merely the human race's default mode of dealing with each other once public order has been enforced."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So, capitalism is about four-hundred years old. Human beings have been around for about 100,000 years. How does this make capitalism the "default mode of dealing with each other"? If capitalism was the "default", hunter-gatherer society would never have arisen because human beings would already have been capitalists.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Capitalism is not a "system", it is a "mode of production" of a system known as "human society". As human society has evolved, it has developed, exploited and discarded several "mode of production" that, despite being ideal when introduced, had been rendered obsolete by the advance of science, technology and social organisation.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 That's how history works. There is no ideal "mode of production", just as there is no ideal organism. Just as the organisms that are best fitted to their environment survive and reproduce, the "mode of production" best suited to a particular stage of development of human society will prove to be the optimal "mode of production" for that historical epoch.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The problem is that the time when capitalism was the mode of production "best fitted" to the shape and needs of human society ended over a hundred years ago. In many ways, the disastrous chain of events that formed the central narrative of the 20th Century and made it the most violent and destructive century in history was the result of our failure to move on to a more appropriate mode of production.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 As much as you tories would like them to be static and immutable, history is a dynamic process and human society is a dynamic entity. The only thing of which we can be sure is that what was ideal yesterday is no longer ideal today. Capitalism did a lot of good for a couple of hundred years a couple of hundred years ago. But, as is inevitable, the world moved on and capitalism became obsolete. Some of us have grown up and accepted this fact, but tories are still locked in a childish tantrum, which is their "default" reaction to change.

                 I wouldn't be so sure the world's population is at it's peak. I have seen no evidence of population growth tapering off.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Even if it was and lets say the world's population stops at around 10 billion, the real problem comes when the poorer 8 billion seek a material lifestyle of the fortunate top 2 billion. It's a mixture of people on the planet AND resource requirement and environmental impact of each of those persons.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But I agree there is little we can do about it. It's not like we have the moral high ground to demand they remain poor? But we can do something about climate change, hence my support on strong action on CO2 emissions.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Your last paragraph is little off track, I couldn't quite follow it, maybe has something to do with living space for the German people hence WW2. Not sure how it follows with WW1? You lost me there with capitalism, I prefer a low grade capitalist system with a heart myself.

                 <br/>
                 "Even if it was and lets say the world's population stops at around 10 billion, the real problem comes when the poorer 8 billion seek a material lifestyle of the fortunate top 2 billion."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 That is an economic problem, not a demographic problem. The problem is that capitalism requires unlimited and continuous growth to maintain a semblance of stability and, regardless of the aspirations of 80% of the population, they will never come close to achieving the "material lifestyle" that you claim they crave.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You see, the only way in which capitalism can make 20% of population rich is by making 80% of the population poor. Capitalism is the ultimate pyramid scheme because it convinces every builder that the pyramid is being built for them to sit on. But every builder believes this, and there is only room for one at the top.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So it is not the population that is unsustainable, but our economic system. Capitalism cannot be sustainable because the earth is finite and capitalism requires the absence of limits to growth. We need a sustainable economic system - one that can remain healthy without constant and unrequired growth.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It is too easy just to blame every problem on our fellow humans and suggest ridiculous notions. But how do you suggest that we fix the problem? Genocide perhaps - or maybe just a good old-fashioned "decimation" (where we kill one in ten of our fellow humans)?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Rather than dealing in fantasy, we should be accepting that there are a hell of a lot of people on earth and that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US has as much right to be here as you. The task is not to reduce the population but to learn to manage the available resources to ensure that we can live sustainably regardless of how many of us there are.

                 The peak and decline, based on what information is the world population going to fall.
                 <br/>
                 Cause according that what i can see and find the population growth is rising and there is no intel that would suggest a sudden fall.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Such a decline would be a world wide event this can only be achieved by a global outbreak of a virus etc, WWIII or a Nuclear holocaust.

                 But we do have the capacity to do something about it, v.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The replacement rate - the reproduction rate that keeps a population stable - is 2.1, yet nearly half the world?s population has birth rates lower than that. The U.S. has a total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.0.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Western European countries have low fertility rates, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Germany has a rate of 1.4, Holland: 1.8, Belgium: 1.8, Spain: 1.4, Italy: 1.4 (the Pope?s views notwithstanding). Sweden has a higher TFR of 1.9 , but that?s still below the replacement rate. Ireland and the U.K. also have high TFRs, at 2.1 and 1.9, respectively, but these rates are derived from non-European immigrant parents. Australia's rate is 2.1, or just enough to replace ourselves.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The conclusion is obvious. Advanced economies means lower birth rates. So the need is to lift the economic standards of the under-developed nations. And that means increased prosperity. And that means cheap and reliable energy.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If you want a lower world population then start advocating decent energy supplies to those most in need.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And that means coal and oil.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Pastor Abdul Sesay, a native of Sierra Leone, said:
                 <br/>
                 "People in Africa and developing nations deserve the opportunity to create better, healthier lives for themselves and future generations.? Sadly, it seems Kyoto Protocol supporters are willing to support a treaty that would deny them a basic necessity like affordable electricity.? How many more must go hungry and die before Western leaders understand that this is not a political game?"
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "If we want our African children to be able to have hope for the future, they must have electricity, especially in the rural areas where there is much need and that means using our coal?.

                 The EU and the US wanted it on the agenda, very arrogant of Abbott to deny them. Overpopulation and climate change are a disaster waiting to happen. I guess the right wing mob that tend to get in early are keen to talk about anything else but AGW. It is the latest tack to say there are more important issues facing us.

               Climate change is only controversial to those who don't look at the data, with they're eyes and minds open.  What, precisely, makes you think that Abbott and his Canadian mate are right, while the rest of the developed world is wrong?

                 I have an economics textbook that is 20 years old. There is a whole section in there about climate change. Sure the textbook might have been a bit before its time, but it argues the economic implications of what happens if climate change is allowed to run unchecked (which it pretty much has) and how the best way to tackle climate change is to price carbon.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It is quite simple even a first year economics student can understand it.

                 Back in the '60s Paul Ehrlich pointed out the many undesirable consequences of uncontrolled population growth, but as recently as the 2000's was ridiculed for it.  The food shortages predicted failed to occur because of a global revolution in crop production.  But the overwhelming problems of population growth are still with us and expanding.  Carbon-dioxide pollution is just one of them, but it's a bloody big one.

                 Unless, of course, you listen to the self-appointed experts who know that melting ice-sheets, rising sea levels, increasing droughts and floods, are just coincidental.

                 "I have an economics textbook that is 20 years old. There is a whole section in there about climate change. Sure the textbook might have been a bit before its time"
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Not really, global warming has been a scientific issue for a long time and the economic implications of inaction were already known in the late 70's.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I first heard of "the Greenhouse Effect" back in 1973, in a high school science class. Our teacher told us about the bloke who discovered it back at the end of the nineteenth century, explained the basic physics and chemistry, and painted a rather alarming picture of the future.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 One of the greatest fictions pedalled by the Denial Industry is the lie that concern about anthropologically-induced climate change is a new development. This is demonstrable nonsense. Research into the relationship between CO2 and atmospheric energy levels has been going on for well over a century.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The main reason that there is controversy over the subject today is that governments have started to take concerns over climate change seriously and are responding to the demands of the people to do something about it. This threatens the power of Big Oil, so the science has become controversial.

                 And yet, when I was in England in 1983, the British economy was a basket case. Sure a small pocket of London was doing fine, but it was a different story in places like Telford and Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, York........it was a very different story. Thatcher was hated, and rightly so. She had destroyed British manufacturing, closed the mines and made the whole place dependent on the dodgey dealings of stock-brokers and futures traders. Of course, this left Britain dangerously exposed to any downturn in financial markets and when the GFC hit, the full idiocy of Thatchers demolition job became apparent. There were riots on the streets. People died. All thanks to Thatcher and her "brilliant" management.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The woman was a monster. A war criminal and fraudster who numbered among her best friends murderous dictators like Augusto Pinochet, was directly responsible for the breakdown of the Zimbabwe peace accord, which was orchestrated by Big Tobacco with her eager assistance.

                 Let's actually see what happened in Britain in 1981 shall we Peter*?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 21 March - Unemployment now stands at 2,400,000 or 10% of the workforce
                 <br/>
                 2 April ? The effects of the recession continue to claim jobs
                 <br/>
                 23 April ? Unemployment passes the 2,500,000 mark for the first time in nearly 50 years
                 <br/>
                 30 May ? More than 100,000 people from across Britain march to Trafalgar Square in London for the TUC's March For Jobs
                 <br/>
                 23 June ? Unemployment reaches 2,680,977 (one in nine of the workforce)
                 <br/>
                 8 July - British Leyland ends production of the Austin Maxi
                 <br/>
                 13 July - Margaret Thatcher announces that police will be able to use rubber bullets, water cannons and armoured vehicles against urban rioters
                 <br/>
                 12 October ? British Leyland announces the closure of three factories
                 <br/>
                 1 November ? British Leyland's 58,000-strong workforces begins a strike over pay
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 In summary: Inflation has fallen to 11.9%, the second lowest annual level since 1973, but has been largely achieved by the mass closure of heavy industry facilities that have contributed to the highest postwar levels of unemployment

                 "Climate change is only controversial to those who don't look at the data, with they're eyes and minds open."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Well, we are talking about tories here. What do you expect. While rational people start with a question and work toward an answer, tories start with the answer that they want and work backwards to find a suitable question.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Science only becomes controversial when it reveals something that is distasteful to the powerful.  Science was suddenly controversial when Gallileo discovered craters on the Moon, because this conflicted with the Aristotelean Cosmology used by the Church, in which only objects below the crystaline sphere containing the Moon (the sublunary world) could be corrupted and anything above the moon was perfect.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Science was controversial again when Darwin and Wallace discovered the fundamental mechanism of evolution (survival of the best fitted), because this conflicted with the biblical explanation of the nature and origins of life.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Science became controversial again when medical researchers discovered links between tobacco smoke and various illnesses, because this threatened the wealth and power of Big Tobacco.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Science became controversial again when chemists and climate scientists discovered a link between CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and atmospheric energy levels, because this threatened the power and wealth of Big Oil.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Science can tell us that a cat can be alive and dead at the same time, and the Catholic Church, Big Oil and Big Tobacco remain mute. They have no interest in the intergity of science. But, when science discovers something that impacts negatively on their power or wealth, science is suddenly controversial and the rich and powerful suddenly become the dself-appointed arbiters of scientific integrity.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Makes perfect sense.

                 <br/>
                 There are a large amount of people including well known, well educated and very well respected scientists who have most certainly looked at the data and hold a counter view to your own.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 unfortunately they have trouble joining the debate because of the "the debate is over" crowd and the public ridicule that comes with anyone who dares to question the anthropogenic climate change religion.

                 John1 your arrogance is showing.  I would suggest that you look again at the well... everything... scientists you know and ask a few pertinant questions.  Better still, look at the data.  That's more than a five-minute job and if you take a little time off being obnoxious it will free up some time to actually check the information.  I suspect that your mind is a little too fixed to make a difference, but it's worth a try.

                 You made an all encompassing statement that is easily refuted using deductive logic. The simple fact is that at the very least one of the premises used to formulate your conclusion is incorrect, rendering the conclusion, no matter how well argued also incorrect!

                 I am an expert at evaluating evidence in the hardest school of all, the legal system. I have looked at the evidence, and I have to say that if it went beofre a court the climate alarmists would lose. They have rigged evidence, lied and tried hard to corner the market in grants. Of course they have told leftish governments (and others) what governments love to hear: ie that theer must be more government control.

                 The author of this article suggests that "deciding whether to serve fish or chicken might cause some anxiety" for any host, well as anyone who has hosted even the smallest event would know, a good host would serve fish AND chicken - and then some.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 In the same way, as the host nation of the G20 Summit, it is essential that the topic of climate change be on the agenda, as would be requested by many of the attendees.  Failure to do so, paints Abbott as a 'leader' (the jury's still out on that one) who refuses to discuss/accept any opinion other than his own.  THAT is not a good leader.

               BS,
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "So why should climate change be on the G20 Summit agenda when issues on global population are not."
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The simple answer to this is that the G20 is a conference on the global economy, not a talkfest of people who like statistics. Global population is simply a number, not a problem. There is no evidence that the current population of the world is either appropriate or inappropriate. It is simply a number that has very little relevance to anyone but statisticians and historians.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The G20 should concentrate on the really pressing economic issues facing the world and right of the top of that list is Anthropogenically-Induced Climate Change. Unless we deal with this problem as a matter of utmost urgency the economic consequences will be far worse than anything we have seen before in human history.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               At the moment, our economy is entirely dependent on the wasteful burning of fossil fuels for energy. If we cannot do it anymore, we are stuffed, and we already know that we cannot do it anymore. So it is rather important that we develop alternative energy sources as a matter of urgency. If we cannot the world economy will collapse, billions will starve, and there is a very good chance that our development as a society could be set back by centuries if not thousands of years.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The challenge of global warming presents us with the best chance since the end of WW2 to modernise and revitalise our productive infrastructure. Just as in the aftermath of WW2, we have little choice. Our existing industrial infrastructure is obsolete because it is dependent on the combustion of a fuel that is in limited supply and cannot be exploited without doing unacceptable damage to the quality of life of the world's people.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So, rather than engaging in yet another irrational rant against your fellow human beings, perhaps you should start thinking about the really important things that we CAN do to make a better, stronger economy and avoid the catastrophe threatened by continued inaction on climate change.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               A G20 that fails to discuss climate change is simply a waste of time.

                 @ v. Thanks for your comments.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 In a highly educated population and a small population like Australia many economists and academics  have got it totally wrong on what Australia should do to fight climate change. And you want to go and talk to another 19 leading nations on this issue?? It is not surprising that they had not been able to convince the majority of Australians on this and that is why we have so much political angst on this issue in Australia.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Global warming is a GLOBAL problem. In the past 20 years annual CO2 emission from Australia has been less than 580m tons a year. But in recent years the annual INCREASES in CO2 emission of China has been more than 700m tons a year. War against climate change is a long term problem and thus strategies must be define over a 30 years or 50 years framework. Then Australia's CO2 emission is irrelevant. Thus nothing should be down in Australia being a very small subsystem of a big dynamic system.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We should not swear at China or India for their CO2 emission because part of China's CO2 emission is caused by Australia outsourcing our CO2 emission to China as many goods we need are made in China.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Thus the strategic and cost effective policies for Australia is to spend a few billion dollars a year in joint R&amp;D research on nuclear energy and renewable energies with China and India with the aim to reduce their CO2 emission.

                 " And you want to go and talk to another 19 leading nations on this issue??"

                 Well, not personally, but I think that Abbott in particular could learn a lot from some real leaders. I don't think that Abbott is in any sort of position to lecture, but he should see the G20 meeting as an ideal learning opportunity.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I know that we have dropped the ball in the last few months, and this is a huge embarrassment, but we also need to remember that, until a few moths ago, we were headed in the right direction, and it is not too late to mend our ways and regain our status as a responsible player on the world stage.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I am not denying that Abbott has a lot to learn when it comes to leadership, and it is clear that his overseas counterparts are somewhat perplexed by his oafish behaviour and incapacity for communication, but their gentle tolerance of his bumbling performances in their presence should serve as an example to him.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The poor man will never learn anything while he refuses to talk about stuff that scares and confuses him.

                 "We didn't have these problems with 4 billion. Climate change is only one of them by the way. General pollution, water and food just as big."

                 But there were still plenty of people, when the population was 4 billion, who were telling us that the world was overpopulated. In fact, Malthus was telling us that the world was overpopulated more than a century ago, when the population was around one billion. And, besides, the size of the world's population isn't the only thing that has changed in the meantime, so all that you could possibly say is that population growth is a POSSIBLE cause of environmental degradation.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 In reality, rapid population growth is likely to be simply another symptom, along with environmental degradation, of a much deeper malady. In the past fifty years, the world economy has become dominated by a military-industrial complex of transnational corporations who have used their monopoly power to subvert democracy in "advanced" western societies and impose tyrannical regimes on the people of the third world, who are forced to live in poverty while watching their natural resources being stolen and their land taken over by foreign agribusiness who grow food for export back to their host nations. Poverty drives population growth and the failure of the capitalist, liberal-democratic model is at the root of the world's intractable poverty problems.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We can persist with monopoly capitalism, or we can have a sustainable future without the need for mass culling of our fellow human beings. But we can't do both. We have to choose.

               Population and climate change are inextricably linked; so closely that are almost the same thing.  One cannot be properly dealt with without the other.  However climate change is having a greater affect on humanity right now than population growth is and climate change must be dealt with, particularly in economic forums like the G20.  Only when we can get climate change under control will we be able to address population and food security.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I have noted your suggestion that Australia plan for a large military base near Darwin.  This strikes me as profound stupidity!  Neither population nor climate and the affects of both, either separately or together, will ever be controlled or ameliorated by killing people or threatening to kill them.

               There is no bigger economic issue than climate change so it should be the centre of the G20 agenda.

               The really sad thing about Abbott's recalcitrance is that moving to a low carbon economy generates innovation, jobs and sustainable economic growth.

               <br/>
               The wholesale destruction he is attempting is being undermined by the market which is making Abbott increasingly marginalised.

                 Menzies got replaced by John Curtin. Australia's greatest PM was John Curtin. Menzies was out of his depth. He was hopeless when confronted by the Nazi invasion of Poland. He didn't know what to do. He left Aussie and went off to London. Hopeless Anglophile who must have known that Britain in those days was no match against Hitler's Germany before Operation Barbarossa. Menzies was in a state of panic and was a wake up to his folly of selling pig iron to Imperial Japan. It was going to come back sooner or later in the form of bullets. My mother has often over the years commented how inept Menzies was at the time.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Menzies in the 1950's and 1960's was an older more wiley politician who loved to engage with Hecklers at open air forums also according to my mother. But  any pollie could of succeeded in the Long Post War Boom and Labor was divided and Menzies got in because unfortunately Chifley wanted to keep the petrol ration. The rest is history.

               Once again, the muddleheads get in first.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Let's simplify a fraction. Pollution = population x GDP/person x nastiness of economic production.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Global population growth in 1967 was over 2%. Population growth in 2013 was about 1.1%. (Max pop growth was 90 m a year in the late 80s, so 80m a year is better than 90m a year.) Trend going in the right direction.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Global GDP/person increasing, although 90% of us wouldn't know it. (If there are 100 people and one of them wins the lottery, average wealth increases.)
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Nastiness of economic production decreasing. Hooray. Wind and sun and energy-efficiency really work, who woulda thunk it?
               <br/>
               <br/>
               If we decrease the nastiness factor at a faster rate than we increase GDP x population growth, we decrease overall pollution. That might work. Why don't we give it a try?
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Subsidies for fossil fuels are an order of magnitude greater than for renewables. Even so, investment in renewables is now greater than for fossil fuels. If we took away all government subsidies for fuels, we'd have a cleaner planet and several $ trillion less in taxes. Surely our corporate overlords should be pleased with that? Unless, and I admit this is a long bow to draw, they somehow derive some benefit from the fossil fuel subsidies, tax breaks, kickbacks and exemptions from basic laws.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               If we wanted to be smart, we could actually punish pollution and use the revenue to, I don't know, pay for universal health care and education. I pay taxes on my booze and cigarettes - 70% of the sticker price of a pack of fags is tax. Imagine if we taxed carbon pollution at the same rate. The number of solar panels in Australia would double in a month, and then double again, and again.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Oh, wait, that's socialism.

               It is hypocritical for a living human to complain about the global human population, no policy can ever curtail it without being fundamentally immoral.  Image how you would react to an ant started arguing with you about there being too many ants.  Yes it will increase to the point of crisis because a policy of population growth will always defeat one of population decline in the long run (people that survive, multiply).  You can't control everything it is better just to accept that you are not god and continue breeding and doing the things that make you happy.

                 The examples of what happens to over-populated species from study of the natural world, suggests very bad outcomes, unless death by starvation, disease and fighting for resources are also somehow warm and fuzzy good things.

             <br/>
             <br/>
             Well, interesting that you believe that it is "the Abbott Government's money"...I would have thought it was tax payer's money.  There just might be a good number of tax payers who would support the work of the WWF, and are appalled that the current Australian government has rejected the requests of the EU, US and other G20 countries for climate change to be on the G20's agenda.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Perhaps it is embarrassing to have the spotlight on the Government's efforts to dismantle Australia's carbon pricing mechanism.  But also it might be more to do with promises made and kept to the fossill fuel industries. Would be enlightening if this government had the backbone to stand up to them and show some principle...for once.

               Judy Bee: I agree with all you have said. However I will be pleased if the leader of this great country gets through without leaving the rest of the G20 shaking their heads in wonderment. Wonderment as to how the best country in the world could elect someone so set in the 19th century with the emphatic belief that faith will fix everything. If that happens we will be able to fight another day when  Australia comes to its senses, and to the realisation that its little flirt with back to the past has been but a passing dream.

               I agree marigold. Professional commentators and their "dorothy dixer" loaded questions from alter-egos.
               <br/>
               Seems to me a hell of a lot of cut and pastingis going on here in these forums. Mostly off-topic stuff designed to bend and deflect or, as I said in an earlier post to mattmattmatty, obfuscate.
               <br/>
               Quite frustrating  when I put effort into reading and responding in an original manner. Like an ad break in decent drama it's unwarranted especially on the ABC ;)
               <br/>
               There are several passages on this page I have seen, word for word, used on a number of occasions over the past two weeks. This in response to many different stories posted. Now I'm not sure if it is deliberate or someone scratched the record but it certainly looks like propaganda to me.

             According to the WWF yearly report, they don't receive any money from the Australian government and certainly not from Abbott. Don't make me laugh - Abbott only gives our public money to the companies who support his fun runs and they are all advertised on his shirt.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             WWF are a Delaware listed company out of the US. They owe Australia nothing. What an ignorant furphy.

           Abbot will not put climate change on the G20 list as he him self don't want it on the list he thinks if he puts his head in the sand and keeps it there then the problems will go away or maybe he is trying to workout a way to get the poor to pay for all the costs it brings on.

               Barsnax  the actual quote is:
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "it is crap that the science of climate change is settled".  The PM is correct in that science is not settled and it hopefully will never be settled.  Unlike gravity climate change is a fluid and ever evolving issue and needs constant surveillance to ensure that we understand it and adapt accordingly.  Unfortunately too many folks have adopted the view that climate change is like gravity - simple observable and finite.

                 To be fair, no science is ever "settled", because the understanding progresses with every new piece of information.  However, the fact that the climate is changing IS settled.  More importantly, the fact that human activity is at least adding to the problem IS ALSO settled.
                 <br/>
                 The only things that are not settled are the details of how things will progress, what is the best solution, and how successful we will be if we attempt to minimise the problem.
                 <br/>
                 If you wish to just close your eyes and say: "we can't guarantee to fix it, so why try", then another thing that is settled is that you live in cloud-cuckoo land.

                 Science can satisfactorily answer questions and often does just that. Sometimes it does not provide a COMPLETE answer to all possible questions arising from a particular observation or conclusion, but this should not be confused with a state of continual irresolution.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We KNOW that the earth is not a flat, square plain with four corners as described in the Bible. There are still some questions regarding the shape of the earth that remain unresolved (like why Gina Reinhart and Clive Palmer are the same shape as it), but we know more than enough to know that it isn't a flat, square plain.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We KNOW that apples fall from trees under the force of gravity, and we KNOW why planets orbit around stars and moons orbit planets. We can predict with enormous precision the positions of planets and even asteroids centuries into the future, based on our understanding of gravity. But we don't really know how gravity works, why it is so weak when compared to the other fundamental forces, or even whether it exists exlusively in our universe or spans several. So, the science of gravity is not settled, but we know enough to know that stepping off a cliff without some means of support is a bloody stupid thing to do.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The simple fact is that you don't need every last question to be answered before deciding on an appropriate question. Once a certain amount of knowledge is gathered, it is possible to preclude possible alternative explanations from the investigation and, at that point, their fate is "settled".
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The science of climate change is not "settled" in that there is still more to learn. But the idea that climate change is not a problem, or that we are powerless to act HAS been "settled" in the negative. We know enough to know that it is a problem requiring our urgent attention, and that is all we really know to get on with it. Our understanding will improve over time, but it is not going to undergo the type of polar reversal that would vindicate the denialists. That part of the debate IS "settled", and Abbott is flogging a dead horse.

                 No, the quote was "man made climate change is absolute crap", and he even admitted he was a climate change denier literally a week before he knifed Turnbull for the leadership
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 He was telling that to anybody who would listen along with fellow climate change deniers Kevin Andrews and Nick Minchin.

                 Such memories people seem to have. This wasn't even 5 years ago.

                 James,
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "The PM is correct in that science is not settled and it hopefully will never be settled. Unlike gravity climate change is a fluid"
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 First of all, we know a hell of a lot about climate change and almost nothing about gravity.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We know how CO2 absorbs and retains infra-red radiation. There is no mystery there. We know that burning carbon-based fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. We know that our combustion of fossil fuels over the past three hundred years has had a significant effect on the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. And we know that energy levels in the atmosphere and oceans have been steadily increasing in line with the modelling for some time now. In other words, all of the important scientific questions regarding anthropogenically-induced climate change have been answered (or "settled" if you prefer).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Abbott is well aware of this. He attended school at the same time that I attended school and would have learnt of the dangers of "the greenhouse effect" as part of his science studies. In other words, when he said that the science is not settled, he was knowingly telling a lie.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Whichever way you try to rephrase his words, Abbott still comes out as a liar, fraud and coward.

                 You're wrong James . The actual quote is "Climate change is crap". Your quote is the more acceptable version Tony introduced after the initial statement was reported more widely than he wanted it to be.

             Climate Change is off the agenda, so too I believe are children's fiction, science fiction and mythology.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             No warming in the last 15 years - and how many G20 meetings in that time? - is a good reason to not to have it on the agenda.

               JohnM - the issue is that Anthropogenic Climate Change is scientific orthodoxy, while fictional stories are ... well ... fictional. Ironically, it is the science deniers who ignore, misrepresent and distort the evidence - and mix it into a story to produce fiction and mythology.

                 Going back to Abbotts quip that it is "crap" that the science is settled only serves to reinforce the argument that your "orthodoxy" view is not necessarily accurate.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 There are many variables and not all scientists agree, contrary to what you and others would have everyone believe.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The fact is that no-one has been able to successfully say exactly what percentage of current warming is due to anthropogenic means. In addition, current warming is not unprecedented in historic terms.........again contrary to what you and others would have everyone else believe.

                 All climate scientists agree human activity is a major (but not only) force in driving climate chage. Just like all biologists agree life evolved.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Arguments within the scientific community is not about weather or not it's happening, but what it's actually causing, and the potential extent of the damage.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 In scientific circles, consensus is going towards climate change being an even bigger problam than previously thought not less.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Only pseudoscientist lawyers who cant get their articles peer reviewed claim it's not a big issue, just like the lawyers who claim to be "intelligent design" "scientists".
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Weather you like to admit it or not: the attacks on climate science is no different from attemtpted attacks on biological evolution. And usually from the exact same people: American religious extremists and the Muslim world.

                 john1 - You assert "Well it is only orthodoxy by way of what you have been fed."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 No, this is simply false. It is orthodoxy because a scientific consensus has been reached within scientific community based on the available evidence. Tony Abbott's or any science denier's opinion is irrelevant. It is within the mainstream peer-reviewed scientific literature where this argument has been fought - and has been decided.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You say "The fact is that no-one has been able to successfully say exactly what percentage of current warming is due to anthropogenic means."
                 <br/>
                 Who has ever claimed that they know exactly the amount that is due to human activity? Their are estimated ranges, and they are all not zero. No scientist claims omniscience. It is only the science deniers who are certain that human activity makes no contribution to global warming and climate change.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "In addition, current warming is not unprecedented in historic terms.........again contrary to what you and others would have everyone else believe" Who has ever said this? While the *rate* of warming increase is probably unprecedented, the amount of warming has been much higher at particular points in the planet's history.

                 Orthodoxy or not, it's a fiction.  What's more it's a fiction that provides a lot of funding to those who endorse it, and when there's no jobs in anything but the fiction, where do people who want a job go to?

                 Doesn't believe in climate change and constantly talks about the last 17 years.
                 <br/>
                 Oh dear. Sorry, but 2010 was globally a lot hotter than 1998. 2013 was the hottest year on record for Australia, and now we are entering the La Nina phase.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I guess this will start a new record for the climate deniers to work on. When the oceans have risen by a few feet: Oh, nothing has changed since 2010 or 2014 or 2016, etc, etc.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>

                 They are the same people who were claiming that asbestos was not dangerous, that lead in petrol was not dangerous, that DDT was not dangerous. No such thing as the hole in the ozone layer due to aerosol use.

                 Asserting it is a fiction does not make it so. Your opinion is opposite to that of the scientific community.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You constantly and repeatedly misrepresent the evidence. The "no warming for 15 years" claim is demonstrably false. It focuses on one part of the planet, but ignores the effect on the biggest part of the planet's surface - the oceans. It is well established that the oceans are absorbing more and more heat - causing them to expand (causing sea level rise) as well as get warmer.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 To cherry pick one piece of data that you think matches your preordained opinion while ignoring the massive amounts of contradictory evidence is just plain dishonest.

               Speaking of fiction, here's one : "No warming in the last 15 years "
               <br/>
               That only works by cherry picking a El Nino Year 1998 as a starting point, then ignoring all those inconvenient years like 2005 and 2010 that were hotter.
               <br/>
               Even you repeat a lie so many times that many people believe, that still doesn't make it true.
               <br/>
               And then of course there is the continual accelerating thermal expansion of the oceans ...

                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 TheMet reports that the  trendline between January 2002 and August 2012 in Hadcrut4 is negative, being minus 0.04 deg C per decade. Between January 2003 and August 2012 Hadcrut4 shows it as minus 0.05 deg C per decade ? that is global cooling.
                 <br/>
                 Faced with reporting a global cooling, the Met Office was in a dilemma. So what did it do in its defence? It rigged the data. The data have always been shown in decadal bands, but faced with this problem it changed the reporting format.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It fudged the report by including the six years 1997 to 2001, thus making this report cover sixteen years, not ten. Why?  Because 1997 was a warm year, so was 1998 and so was 2001. They were deliberately inserted and distorted the figures. ?

                 Speaking of fiction, here's another one:
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The UK Met Office was in serious trouble, confounded by its own data. First, the trend overall from 1978 onwards was, first a decreasing rate of temperature rise, and then an actual cooling.
                 <br/>
                 The UK Met Office conceded this by reporting:
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 " ?  the  trendline between January 2002 and August 2012 in Hadcrut4 is negative, being minus 0.04 deg C per decade. Between January 2003 and August 2012 Hadcrut4 shows it as minus 0.05 deg C per decade?.
                 <br/>
                 That's an actual, measured, verified cooling.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So the UK Met Office was in trouble, defeated by its own data. But it had to maintain its political stance, so it had to fudge the figures to maintain its allegations. How did it do this? First, by cherry-picking the best year as a starting point. 1998 was an El Nino year, and therefore unusually warm. So it wanted that year in the figures. But 1999 and 2000 were, by contrast, cooler years, so it wanted them out. Therefore it used a ?decade by decade? process, working  backwards, but not using the usual decade format. Taking the El Nino year of 1998 into in one period but deliberately excluding 1999 and 2000 meant that the decade had to end at 1988, and the one before that at 1978. The trouble was that this process revealed a diminishing rate of temperature increase across the twenty years from 1978 to 1998, even though the hot year of 1998 was included. It faced even more trouble with the next decade, because that decade showed a cooling. To overcome this problem, the decade was fudged again and became a twelve year decade instead of ten, up to the end of 2010. This allowed it to cherry-pick 2010 -a warm year ?  into its data which meant it was able to say there had been a statistically observable warming trend after 1998, albeit a very small one. If the report had been consistent, that is, up to 2008, the decrease would have been marked.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The climate alarmists are the champion cherry-pickers.

                 262-3/540-4.  I can see at least five lies through these two posts (though I am counting the one he repeats as two lies).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Firstly, "TheMet reports that the trendline between January 2002 and August 2012 in Hadcrut4 is negative, being minus 0.04 deg C per decade."
                 <br/>
                 Apart from the fact that a ten-year trend isn't long enough to derive statistically significant trends, it seems odd that John would pick a timeframe that begins in a January and ends in an August, thereby not properly averaging eccentricities in the Earth's orbit and what it would do to the distance between the Earth and sun (and, by extension, the amount of solar radiation one would expect if other factors were equal).  That is until you consider that such a selected time period would see the Earth move away from the sun, and John isn't interested in truth - but rather, any argument, however specious, that supports his agenda to undermine respect for the science behind AGW.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 He then goes on to make unsupported and internally incoherent arguments about rigged data.  The most entertaining of these is that they wanted the data line for 2002-2012 to show a temperature increase, and so rigged data by adding 1997-2001 (inclusive of one of the hottest years on records at the BEGINNING of the data set, an inclusion which would tend to distort the trend in such a way as to show a decrease in temperature over this time period).

                 If you had bothered to do your research you'd find a miniscule change in deep ocean temperatures since 2003 (only 10 years) but there is no good explanation of how that heat could possible get there without being evident on or very near the surface.

                 They are called ocean currents.  Water circulates around the globe and carries the heat with it.

                 That miniscule change in ocean temperatures averaged over the whole of the world's oceans to a depth of 2km is a whole lot of heat.

                 Hey man, I have bothered to do the research and I'm afraid it points to more oceanic warming than 'a miniscule change in deep ocean temps' (e.g. Nuccitelli et al., Physics Letters A, Vol 376, 3466-3468, 2012).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And what has the Sydney Harbour Bridge got to do with things? All I know is that my grandfather helped to build it, and I'm sure it won't be scrap any time soon!

                 John,
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "If you had bothered to do your research you'd find a miniscule change in deep ocean temperatures since 2003 "
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Ah yes, you had to throw in the word "deep" because these are the only ocean temperatures that have not changed significantly in the past ten years.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Ocean temperatures are rising even faster than atmospheric energy levels, which are currently increasing at a faster rate than at any time in the past few million years.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If you cherry-pick climate observations carefully enough, you can create any scenario you like. But if you look at them in their entirety over the past century or so, the picture is pretty clear.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If you tories have a problem with the science of climate change, why didn't you raise your objections back at the end of the nineteenth century when it was first proposed? Why did you wait until Big Oil's profits were under threat before you became interested in the integrity of science?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Can you name one example of a corporation making a scientific objection to a discovery that did not affect their vested interests? Can you ever remember a tory politician raising objections to a discovery that did not affect the vested interests of their sponsors?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Stop whingeing about the science. The science is clear. Climate change is a clear and present danger. It is the most urgent question currently facing humanity. It is caused by the combustion of carboniferous fuels on a massive scale over three centuries. Atmospheric and oceanic energy levels are on the rise, sea levels around the world are on the rise, polar and alpine icecaps and glaciers are in retreat and the Gulf Stream is weakening.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If the denial industry had any genuine objections to climate science, they had over a century in which to do so. Why is only since people have started to demand action from their governments that Big Oil has gotten so interested?

                 I see the same handful of names do nothing on these forums other than oppose the science of climate change. I believe they are employed full time to mislead others to further their own financial agenda.

                 <br/>
                 They are so desperate to be heard that they have resorted to propaganda techniques similar to what worked for Hitler. By boldly reflecting accusations back at the enemy, the weak minded are befuddled and convinced to believe the lie at the expense of the truth.

                 <br/>
                 It isn't stupidity, ignorance or accidental - these guys have studied the artform and are adept at brainwashing others. The regular deniers on the ABC will know who they are (many appear in an organised manner in these comments). It wouldn't surprise me to find out that they all have a common employer. They probably have a daily meeting to come up with  an angle of attack and catchphrases and slogans to suit current trends. Well done people!. I guess we all need to earn a dollar....but how do you live with yourselves?

               Abbott says he believes in man made Climate Change.
               <br/>
               Abbott says that Australia will act in concert on Climate Change when other countries come to the table.
               <br/>
               Abbott says Australia should not go it alone but act on Climate Change in a world wide response so that Australia does not have to carry any extra burden by Australia going it alone.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So when nearly all of the G20 nations and the OECD are doing and increasing their actions on man made Climate Change what does Abbott do?
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Abbott runs and hides behind Stephen Harper bleating that to tackle Climate Change you can't Clobber the Economy.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Well that's all very well and good if you are a supporter of the Fossil Fuel industry and the Dirty disgusting Coal industries but what about the welfare of the planet and those who live here.
               <br/>
               Abbott has a Mantra of short term economic opportunity over reasoned action on Climate Change because despite what he may say about believing in man made Climate Change he really believes and was truthful when he stated that "Climate Change is Crap."
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Now I know that there will be dozens of posts on this site supporting Abbotts decision to not have Climate Change on the agenda at the G20 meeting but I will tell you lot something.
               <br/>
               The "majority of Australians believe in Climate Change". It would be very foolish to underestimate the passion of  the average Australian in regards of being  aware of Climate Change .
               <br/>
               <br/>
               To go on dismissing Climate Change as a radical Green religious alarmist response is nothing but shrill name calling in the hope that people who in your estimation are gullible will side with you lot. The Fossil Fuel industry may employ glossy and professional advertising which they are very good at but in the long run it is just a repeat of Big Tobacco on this front. Australians are well aware of the impacts of Climate Change and even those who try to dismiss it on Ideological Grounds are the worse for wear. They look like Idiots.

               It is not true and a very short time looking at data will show that.  IF, and I doubt that's the case, you are interested.

               I repeat this below but it is relevant here as well:
               <br/>
               <br/>
               'I know I shouldn't bite but...  These are common climate denial myths and cataloged as such.  Simple Google searches (e.g. 'climate change no warming in 15 years' or 'climate change no evidence to support') will show this and the relevant debunking.  This is not 'opinion' but either empirical fact or accepted scientific theory (which is a whole lot more robust than an opinion!).
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The only thing I will acknowledge you have a point on is that modelling is iffy because a single wrong assumption or incorrect data point can skew the results, but even without projections based on modelling there is more than enough solid evidence to see climate change is occurring, and to extrapolate from prior periods of radically different climate (and known physical effects such as lots of ice melting and thus changing water levels) that at the very least there would be significant economic impacts that could radically alter EVERYTHING.  E.g.  Current food bowls no longer being able to produce food or areas where anopheles mosquitoes (malaria bearing) cannot live becoming places where they can,  not to mention the likely desperate migration of the people living in suddenly uninhabitable areas to places that are still (or are newly) viable.  All of this is extremely likely to have tremendous economic impact on the world!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Therefore the G20 discussing this would make sense, whether that be for prevention or merely mitigation, or if you are cold-hearted enough, how to benefit from it I guess.'

             G20 is completely the wrong forum for climate change discussions.

             Its like going to a Parents and Friends meeting and wanting to discuss why the NBN is not coming to your suburb anytime soon.

           Quote: But we know that if left unchecked climate change could cause trillions of dollars of damage and lost revenue, affecting business, jobs and the economy. Even a two-degree increase in global temperatures - which we are currently on track to surpass - could shave as much as 2 per cent off the global economy.
           <br/>

           There it is. The ever reliable "could" in both sentences. The always present but unsupported by actual evidence two degrees.
           <br/>

           And when did Australia ever "control" this apparently strategic international issue. Labor was always worried that Australia would be left behind. Now we are told Australia was leading the way.
           <br/>

           Still, the world is told the science is settled. All that remains is the power grabbing politics. Shame on all alarmists.

             Yes - shame on all the alarmists who loudly proclaim that paying an extra 5c for electricity for a while will be the end of the world as we know it.  Funnily enough the same people who make their money from fossil fuels.

             Shame on the people who think it is OK to gamble with the planet's climate and think we should base our policies on wishful thinking and assume that all of the world's scientists have got it wrong.

                 Those must be the scientists who produce the 1% of papers that disagree with human induced climate change. I'll take my information from NASA, CSIRO, beyond a group of renegades. I doubt though that you'd ever bother to check where a lot of them get their funding, and hence their credibility, from. Feel free to surprise me - but more importantly, yourself.

               All insurance is based on well understood, properly conducted statistical analysis of past events where the mechanisms are understood and the data sets a robust basis to extrapolate to the future ( Weibull distributions  using shape and other parameters derived from historical data etc). The number crunching is done by specialists who work in the field all the time. not by kudos chasing amateurs looking for funding for their next ship of folly expedition.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The models, which represent the 'best' quantified understanding of the climate system are quite out of whack with the observations and also with each other on the evidence presented by the IPCC.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               If underwriters tried me on for the sort of premium scam the AGW mob are seeking I would cancel my policies because it would be better to go bare. Fortunately insurance is run by the private sector on real world principles where the aggregated self interest of all parties sees common sense prevail.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               If you want to insure against the sky falling, I am sure you can find an underwriter. They just might be a pretty dodgy outfit but if its your money on the line that is your business.

                 The 2014 National Electricity Forecasting Report issued on Monday by the Australian Energy Market Operator has highlighted once again how all previous assumptions about electricity demand have been turned on their head in recent years."

                 In other words, the people who know about money, as well as the scientists, are telling us the same thing.

                 Non-renewable power is heading into a terminal spiral.    Power prices are heading up - in Western Australia the government as forecasting a 7% increase in power prices.

               If the whole "INSURANCE INDUSTRY"  now calculates its risk aversion on Climate Change and surely the Insurance Industry makes its decisions based on what could impact on it's policy definitions due to reasonable and well researched climate conditions then what does that indicate about Climate Change?.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The Antithesis  of Climate Change are the Fossil Fuel industries (and those who profit from it )which continues with subterfuge and glossy advertising to convince people how great and wonderful they are for the future of energy in this country and that they are also on the same page as being Green, Environmentally and Ecologically Sensitive when in real terms they are the opposite.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               One industry quietly goes about its business model while the other spends an enormous amount of dollars on advertising in an attempt to convince (Fool) us otherwise.

               You have made a good argument and with regards to insurance, I wonder how many people realise it  costs will rise with AGW.
               <br/>
               I wounder if any have notice that all of Abbott government policies are prefix with "I'm certain"
               <br/>
               Yet again their are some commenting whom want to argue the science.
               <br/>
               When will they notice that a huge majority of the leaders of our planet are no longer arguing the science ?
               <br/>
               It's embarrassing that our PM believes that a rock of coal is natural energy. All those years and dollars spent educating him yet he doesn't understand that a rock of coal is a rock.
               <br/>
               Energy must be applied to that rock of coal to cause a chemical reaction before any energy is released by it.
               <br/>
               Gravity is an example of a natural force of energy not a rock of coal. Wind is a natural force of energy not the liquid substance we call oil.
               <br/>
               The world leaders are taking actions to limit AGW yet our PM doesn't want to talk with them about it.
               <br/>
               Abbott and his team have a plan called "Direct Action" they have had about 5 years to develop it, yet they are still in the planning stage of this plan. What a lie it was when Abbott announced " We are ready to govern "?
               <br/>
               When will they admit that "Direct Action" was a "scam" to delude others into believing they had a plan ?
               <br/>
               World leader realise Abbott's   "scam"
               <br/>
               They will develop their countries economies around a reduction of the use of fossil fuels.
               <br/>
               Will our countries leader not recognise it ?

                 A real shame that deniers never debate on merit.  They deny the facts without ever properly refuting them and prefer to "play the man" by attacking the credibility of prominent climate change researchers.

                 <br/>
                 When that fails they bring out the usual "it was a warm winter day yesterday" anecdotal rubbish that only serves to prove just how myopic they are.

                 I agree. However, approximately 99% of the scientific papers produced in relation to climate change agree with human induced climate change. Name calling doesn't help anyone. Understanding the science will.

               Yes, Pom, I COULD get shot in the left foot by a Martian wearing a Santa Claus suit in Collins Street at 3pm on a Wednesday. But I declined my Insurance Company's suggestion to take out a cover against this eventuality.

               When people tell me that I SHOULD insure against a risk that I COULD suffer, I always look at the actual problem, not the hysterical hypothesis.

               WP, a rational approach to insurance requires an understanding of the risks.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Life on earth could be extinguished by a meteor strike. Are you insured against such a risk?
               <br/>
               <br/>
               As for deniers, if you want to be taken seriously you'll have to be specific. Exactly who is denying exactly what?

               <br/>
               I'll start, you deny that the risks of having increased CO2 in the atmosphere are insignificant.

             As ever FG you have managed to completely miss the point - Abbott applauds coal and is reluctant to do anything about AGW solely because he needs Clive Palmer's bloc of votes in the Senate. Your little semantic quibbles are as ever simply a diversion to hide the fact you don't understand what is happening.

             <br/>
             <br/>
             of course, i would take your opinion anyday, against all those cheating, lying, greedy scientists who are making up all this stuff just to get research grants.

             It seems to me that you can't handle the truth .. but let's try anyway
             <br/>
             - no warming over the last 15 or so years and no indication when warming might resume
             <br/>
             - no evidence whatsover to believe that CO2 emissions cause significant and dangerous warming.  (Opinions and the output of dodgy models are NOT evidence.)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             And you really think that something that hasn't been present for 15 years and has no evidence to support it should be on the agenda?

                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Medieval warm period perhaps?
                 <br/>
                 How about the late cretaceous?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Or do you prefer just to look at the last 150-200 years of "cherry-picked" data showing a rise?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 How about including the mini ice age where the rise begins, or what about including the period before that, as well as the medieval warm period where global fluctuation both up and down show that the current warming is not really statistically significant in the absence of data manipulation..............................oops, should i have said that....oh no, I have been a naughty boy!

                 Most of the CO2 increase is from natural sources. Estimates vary from 20:1 to 40:1 of natural versus human release of CO2, which either way still means it's nutty to blame humans for majority of the increase when the evidence says otherwise. Not that CO2 is particularly relevant to be blamed for global warming, as it's only a fraction by comparison to the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere (water vapour is far, far, far more influential as a greenhouse gas than CO2).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The AGW bunch want to blame CO2, and carry on like a broken record repeating the same doomsday prophecies without any regard at all for the actual evidence. Worse, the AGW pushing "experts" have been exposed as notorious liars about evidence, repeatedly. Then adding to the silliness, a pack of very loud, and apparently gullible people who think that because something is labelled as "environmental concern" (and that must "good", right?) that it therefore must 'true' and anyone who disagrees with the holy prophets of doom must be infidels to be insulted, attacked, decried as "deniers" of the sacred orthodoxy. They cite predictions from climate models that have proven again and again for the decades to be faulty,  while the charlatans at the top of the cult "reinterpret" their previous predictions and pretend to have been "right all along" regardless of how many times they fail.

                 @John1 - O-16/O-18 ratios giving global temperature estimates go back some 800K years now, and even during the periods where Earth swung between ice ages and interglacial periods, we see nothing approaching the rate of temperature increase we see for the past 100 years.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 @AJC - Most deniers have worked out that half-truths are more destructive than outright lies, and usually contend with the worn-out line "human emissions are only 3% of natural emissions", or words to that effect, and don't discuss the cumulative effect this has, or that sequestration rates essentially absorbed all the natural CO2 (but can't absorb all of ours).  If you're going to go a step further and actually lie outright, and claim that the CO2 increase is mostly from natural sources (too easily disputed by isotope studies), presumably you haven't figured this out.

               JohnM - you are deliberately misrepresenting the evidence. Your first claim about no warming over the last 15 years ignores the 70% of the surface of the planet (the oceans) which definitely have been warming. This is a classic case of cherry picking one piece of evidence that you think supports your denialist views while ignoring all of the evidence that directly contradicts it.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Your second claim about there being "no evidence whatsoever to believe that CO2 emissions" cause significant warming is just laughable. It is the direct opposite of the view of every major scientific organisation in the world. It is a silly opinion that is on par with moon landing deniers or crop circle enthusiasts.

                 The oceans warmed 2000 metres down, marginally, they didn't warm at the surface. Air temperatures globally haven't changed for years, regardless of all the hype trying to pretend otherwise, there's been no actual rise since the mid-1990s. If you haven't forgotten physics, you may recall that warm water goes up, it doesn't hide deep down instead. A rational person should realise that the source of the tiny amount of additional heat in the oceans must be deeper down in those oceans, most likely geothermal vents and undersea volcanoes. Blaming humans for that extra temperature is akin to saying "Magic Did It" because the claim ignores physics.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I'm not sure what you classify as a "major" scientific organisation, because as far as I've seen, the 'list' of scientific organisations often repeated in copy &amp; paste only shows those of 12 nations. That's not remotely close to a 'majority', and absolutely is not "every" scientific organisation in the world. Last I checked, there are over 200 nations on this planet, so the politically biased "science" view of 12 is minor. I suppose that this exaggeration of fictional support is the same kind of distortion which AGW alarmists keep using when they claim 97% "consensus" about a survey of 79 scientists in which 77 agreed with AGW while the thousands of other scientists queried didn't bother to reply to the survey. That survey is very unconvincing, and not scientific. Another "study" searching for keywords in scientific papers were exposed as misleading when the authors included numerous sceptical scientists' papers as being in the "agree with AGW" category in order to inflate the numbers. There are also many scientific organisations in western nations whose leadership publicly declare agreement with AGW theory in contradiction with the survey results of those same organisations' membership are usually evenly split on the issue.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Before you repeat the anti-scientific assertion blaming CO2 for warming, I suggest that you research the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, the amount of CO2 from natural sources, the comparison between natural and human sources, and the influence of other greenhouse gases such as water vapour. Then when you've completed that assignment, make a comparison between solar activity cycles and global temperatures. Don't be lazy going to a second-hand "opinion" but check instead the real numbers. I've done the research, that's why I'm a sceptic. AGW theory is anti-scientific nonsense being promoted for political purposes, with cheerleaders in the environment groups that don't care what the actual evidence is as long as their agenda of anti-humanism is pushed as well. CO2 taxes are only a scam for putting more money in government coffers. Carbon trading is just another scam for financial frauds and banksters to manipulate, another gambler's market to play with. It becomes very clear.

                 A long and reasonably eloquent presentation of your opinions. But the fact remains that your opinions are at odds with the evidence in the view of the mainstream scientific community. You are free of course to disagree with the scientific consensus, but you are not free to deny that it exists. Asserting a massive global conspiracy in which "AGW theory is anti-scientific nonsense being promoted for political purposes" it just hilariously ridiculous. Scientists are some of the most independent and free thinking people on the planet, and their respect for truth and evidence is paramount. Proposing that every single  one of these professionals would prostitute their position and their personal and intellectual integrity by playing along with this "anti-scientific nonsense" is about as stupid and implausible as conspiracy theories get.

                 All conspiracy theories on the surface initially seem plausible. But upon deeper analysis, it quickly becomes evident that the narrative that has been constructed is a house of cards that quickly falls when exposed to scrutiny.

               JohnM, you are going to come unstuck because 2015 will be a record hot year due to El Nino (as was 1998 15 years ago).

               Then in 2016 you can reset and start saying "No warming for one year" blah blah  blah.

               Except you have no idea what you are talking about JohnM. The oceans are the most reliable method of determining gradual warming, and they have been warming.

               <br/>
               This has ALWAYS been the case with measuring global warming. Climate change is the study of the effects this has.

               <br/>
               As for the CO2 emmissions having a warming effect, that has been settled and not a single credible scientific paper has ever shown this to not be the case.

                 Well I suppose they would if the temperature rose to the year 2000 and then leveled off and no decrease.So why did the temperature level off after 2000 when CO2 levels are going through the roof.Thats right it all started hiding in the ocean or did the volcanos eat all the radiative forcing.The fact is the computer models failed to forecast it.So what else have they failed at.

               I know I shouldn't bite but...  These are common climate denial myths and cataloged as such.  Simple Google searches (e.g. 'climate change no warming in 15 years' or 'climate change no evidence to support') will show this and the relevant debunking.  This is not 'opinion' but either empirical fact or accepted scientific theory (which is a whole lot more robust than an opinion!).
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The only thing I will acknowledge you have a point on is that modelling is iffy because a single wrong assumption or incorrect data point can skew the results, but even without projections based on modelling there is more than enough solid evidence to see climate change is occurring, and to extrapolate from prior periods of radically different climate (and known physical effects such as lots of ice melting and thus changing water levels) that at the very least there would be significant economic impacts that could radically alter EVERYTHING.  E.g.  Current food bowls no longer being able to produce food or areas where anopheles mosquitoes (malaria bearing) cannot live becoming places where they can,  not to mention the likely desperate migration of the people living in suddenly uninhabitable areas to places that are still (or are newly) viable.  All of this is extremely likely to have tremendous economic impact on the world!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Therefore the G20 discussing this would make sense, whether that be for prevention or merely mitigation, or if you are cold-hearted enough, how to benefit from it I guess.

               Cobber, the term "global warming" was changed because a brief break in the warming process could be inaccurately interpreted as a return to normal.  Climate change is certainly occurring across the globe, but not everywhere is warming equally, because the world is a large and complex environmental system.
               <br/>
               Sadly, getting a grip on just what is or isn't happening requires a consideration of multiple factors and consequences.  As a grandfather, I'd be overjoyed if I saw real evidence that my grandchildren won't need to worry about rising sea levels, reduced crop yields, spreading of tropical diseases to more temperate zones, and the rest.
               <br/>
               Unfortunately, that kind of security is becoming clearly less likely.

               Climate change has economic consequences.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               It is a keen topic amongst economists, who look at the impact of climate on food production, consumer decisions (ie: warm clothes and air conditioning), energy production (winter vs summer) and therefore on a wide range of production and distribution decisions.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               No rational economist ignores climate - it makes or breaks economies.

                 Reinhard, Obama's 'policies' have not passed any legislature, in fact his policies have completely failed in that public test - he is relying on regulation to enforce limits.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 He has in particular chosen a start date specifically because his strict 'limits' have already been fulfilled by some half as 15% of his 30% between 2005-2012 has already been acheived by free market conditions.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So his 'strict limits' will be an actual 'lowering' of emmisions of 15% over the next 16 years.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Despite these limits, costs to households will be some US$3400 per annum for an expected averting of .05 degrees fahrenheit over the next 85 years.
                 <br/>
                 Householders will not be compensated &amp; in the US a low income household is a really low income household.
                 <br/>
                 As Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) points out, ?A lot of people on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum are going to die.?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Meanwhile China - who have at best hinted they may or may not do something will double the US's current electricty usage by 2040, using up an additional 10 times the CO2 emmisions that the US may save.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But even then the 'problem' wont be averted, as Lord Stern points out - that a worldwide price on 'carbon' needs to be at least 240 pounds to make significant difference.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 All of this to offset an, as yet, undefined amount of man made global warming, Please oh Please - give me a break!

                 The US target is 17% reduction by 2020 compared to Abbott's hollow promise of 5%. Monash University?s Centre of Policy Studies and The Climate Institute both found that Direct Action plan would see Australia?s CO2 emissions increase!....

               Yes, you're right.  Obama is using the powers of his EPA to reduce emissions in a direct way.  Obama is not using a market mechanism.  Neither is Abbott, who  is using funding to bring emissions down.  Setting a goal, which Obama has done, is still direct action.  Australia also has a goal; that is also direct action.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The similarity of their policies perhaps explains why they got on so well last week.

           Mr Abbott is uncomfortable talking about climate change at any time.
           <br/>
           His support base largely agree with his "climate change is crap" position.
           <br/>
           "Direct action" is nothing more than a fig leaf to claim that he is serious when it is in conflict with his earlier position that a price on carbon is the best solution.
           <br/>
           What the US President wants will be on the agenda.

               Alfie, you call Mr Abbott's plan as his "sensible direct action approach". But only a few posts earlier, you wrote that climate science was "alarmist fairy stories".
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Logically then, your are of the view that Mr Abbott has a sensible approach to solve fairy stories.

           Never thought I'd see the words 'strong leadership and skilful diplomacy' in an article about Abbott.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The G20 is shaping up to be the most embarrassing moment ever in Australian diplomatic history.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The G20 represents the worst aspects of corporate greed and short-term profiteering. To go beyond what even that crowd of self-interested grey men is comfortable with marks Abbott out for the twisted ideologue he is.

               I think the US commedians did a pretty good job without the need for any of us to assist. With Abbott, the comedy and cringe writes itself.

               Rudd calling a super power rodent lovers authorising taps on the Indonesian presidents wife, err this is the removal of an item on an agenda that can easily be discussed on other forums. Just because something is popular in your echo chamber doesn't make it an embarrassment.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The phone tapping is to me shameful not the revelation that we did the fact that we did do it.

               Due to our size we are followers on the world stage not leaders, remember the pride that was felt when elected to the security council
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Along with those world powers and bastions of democracy and.decency Argentina and Rwanda

               <br/>
               We had to bribe and crawl to be elected with Rwanda
               <br/>
               <br/>
               That's what the world thinks of us we are in the same group with  Rwanda that's pretty humiliating.

                 Cynical Rubbish. And what has Rudd and our place on the UN got to do with the stuff ups Abbott has continued with not to mention all the LIES he has propagated. We (Australia) has move on from the phone tapping.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The EU scheme is a work in progress. It encompasses many European states and they are working together. Take a look at Germany if you would like to see just one European state (the powerhouse of Europe in fact) and see how purposefully the Germans are using Renewables and altering everything from Transport to Energy with Renewables. The Germans are to be commended and they are not going backwards economically. Rather Germany is going from strength to strength and recognises the future.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The US direct action scheme actually imposes limits on the amounts of CO2 produced by polluting coal fired power stations. Completely different to the Voluntary Clap Trap proposed by Abbott. There is no meat on the bones of Abbott's direct action plan. It is a sop to the polluters. Nothing else.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 China is investing in Renewables. China wishes to maintain its extraordinary economic growth but has realised that it also wishes to protect its citizens from the toxic fallout of coal burning power stations (even though the Chinese ones are state of the art). Otherwise it will become just too much of a health risk (if not already) for human habitation in Chinese mega cities.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Russia has an abundance of fossil fuels and natural gas. The latter which they export in large quantities to Europe. Although not the best solution to fossil fuel CO2 emissions it is far preferable to dirty, filthy and polluting coal. China has recently signed an agreement with Putin's Russia for natural gas.

                 Slandering less fortunate nations (Rawanda and Argentina) is nothing short of bullying and gutless from a position of protection. Contempt for fellow humans is what it is closet romantic.

                 BTW Argentina is progressing and its economy and citizens are doing much better now along with the rest of South America now that they have ditched Neo Conservative agenda's and are Social Democratic. I would say their dark pasts and interference by the CIA are now ancient history.

                 What has Rudd and the UN got to do with this embarrassment
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 What I am trying to point out is that it is more a matter of perspective Rudds actions I found to be embarrassing calling the Chinese RAT F**kers is pretty embarrassing even if he did feel betrayed by their actlons.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Tapping a presidents wife is shameful and dishonourable.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We are talking about diplomatic embarrassments, The media has moved on from the phone tappings, you have moved on from the phone toppings only because it was not the diplomatic disaster that Abbott haters wanted it to be.i

                 See the echo chamber at work, there is more to come from Snowden so we are not over it at all. I remember this because I do  have an attention span  longer than ten seconds.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And that's the point about the US and EU it's all word games so far promises and good ideas their rubber has not hit the road and the place where the US has had success is coal seam gas etc, so at the moment all the rhetoric in the world is not real action. I have these awful suspicions that of course other countries want to say all the right things while doing nothing really concrete about it. Calling it a target or a work in orogress is another way of saying it hasn't happened yet.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The UN thing was another thing that Rudd pushed and the country spent and bribed to get this seat but we got in with countries that could not afford to do what we did so we basically bought our position at the table and came in with a country that is recovering from a military dictatorship, missing people and a failed war on one of the permant members and a country that is recovering from genocide and civil war.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You don't find that humbling? Still think the world really cares about what Australia does or does not do?
                 <br/>
                 Global warming is a global problem and as a country we could be much lower in emmissions if that is what we really want but we never do anything real about it we just hamstring our own industry and lifestyle. To the applause of those who corrupt their own systems say the right thing but still do nothing real.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We don't insist that all new cars sold in Australia are LPG or ethanol based both more able to be produced here and lower in emmissions, we don't centralize our industry and transport hubs so public transport while  great for the inner city is not terrific for the bedroom community or industrial suburbs where most of us live and work, we don't create decent affordable medium  to high density housing to make the delivery of services easy and lower cost in terms of a carbon footprint, we don't really investigate the nuclear option in the medium  term so that we have emmission free electricity until reneweables come on line. We are getting better at making our houses more solar friendly so that our lighting and light appliances can run on that while our big appliances, heating and cooling run

           To say that Australia has "strategic control" of the issue would imply that we have a significant impact on the outcome.

           Australia and it's coal could disappear under the waves tomorrow. The reduction in global emissions would be so small, climate scientists would assume it was a statistical error.

           "But the question keeps coming up, why is the Prime Minister so keen to keep climate change off the agenda at this year's summit?"
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The answer is that Abbott knows his position on climate change is a minority position vis-a-vis other world leaders. When you're the only person at the dinner party dressed in budgie smugglers you know you're out of fashion. Better to stand in the corner alone, or better still, hide in a bedroom.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Abbott doesn't want climate change on the agenda because he doesn't want intelligent debate taking place on his home turf. Better for him (and Hunt) to say the world is following Australia's lead than to admit that Australia is following a Pied Piper on this issue. You don't want to frighten the voters, do you?

            <p>
             Au contraire.  Abbot knows there's no evidence to support the notion that CO2 emissions cause dangerous warming.  (Point of fact: the IPCC has worked for 25 years and still can't prove it.)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Abbott is playing coy on it because he knows how the news media in this country will react if he says what he thinks.  You know the news media that I mean, the kind that rarely if ever posts articles from sceptics, the kind that has never even tried to investigate whether the scientific claims of the alarmists are anything more than hot air.  (Sorry about the pun but it was irresistable!)

               I know it would take a nuclear explosion to shift you from your denialist platform John, so I won't waste my time trying; evidence means nothing to a confirmed sceptic.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               But I will take you to task about this statement: "You know the news media that I mean, the kind that rarely if ever posts articles from sceptics"
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Au contraire again. The newspaper landscape in this country is dominated by the Murdoch empire (care to disagree?).  The Murdoch papers, especially The Australian, rarely print articles that contradict the denialist position (care to disagree?).

                 "Confirmed sceptic" suggests there is critical thought involved.  I'd suggest that "confirmed denialist" is more appropriate.  Doesn't imply any sort of rational thought.

                 You have it backwards. Scepticism requires evidence to be presented before any acceptance can be offered for a theory, but the AGW theory has such contradictory evidence and so much dishonesty among those who have promoted it, no truly rational, knowledgeable, independent thinker can accept it.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The "Blame CO2" game doesn't work, nor does the blaming humans for all increase in CO2, when most CO2 is from natural sources, far overwhelming human sources by a factor of 20 to 1 (at least!). Water vapour is a greatly more influential greenhouse gas, but the AGW alarmist mob doesn't care about that because it contradicts their distortions and excuses. The AGW alarmists most often are composed of simple repeaters; they repeat what they've been told, without analysis of whether it's truth or lie on the evidence, instead relying on the same dodgy "authority figures" - no independent checking. When anyone - without regard to actual ability, knowledge, proven expertise, experience - criticises AGW theory, instead of checking anything properly, the AGW alarmists rely upon the 'same' authority figures that are promoting the AGW theory, with the gullible belief that 'they' must be the sole arbitrators of "truth". Anyone outside the "approved" group isn't even listened to with the least bit of respect, the reaction is identical to that of a religious fundamentalist when their cult's Great Leaders are criticised by outsiders. Have you noticed how the term "Denier" is used in exactly the same way as cultists refer to those people who offend their religious beliefs; heretic, infidel, and pariah.

                 And that, AJC, is why "confirmed denialist" is a more accurate description of many of the self-titled sceptics who post aggressive and derogatory opinions here.
                 <br/>
                 But once again, it is entirely possible to raise a few correct points that demonstrate the uncertainties of AGW and ignore a great deal more points that build a much more threatening picture.
                 <br/>
                 The constant repetition of the claim that there has been no warming for the past 15 or 17 years (depending on who is writing) can only be taken seriously by those who have not looked at the overall picture for the past 50 years.  This period has seen the greatest expansion of global atmospheric pollution ever inflicted on the world by mankind, the scale of which is barely understood by human societies.
                 <br/>
                 Consider the various calculations done on the Iceland volcano that stopped air travel in the northern hemisphere for months.  Even the most optimistic calculations show that the pause in air travel saved more carbon dioxide emmission than the volcano produced.  And this is just one little component of what's happening through human activity.  So the argument for non-anthropogenic warming (the only other option, because warming is undeniable) is naive at best.

               JohnM - so you are calling Tony Abbott a deceitful liar, as he has stated publicly numerous times that he accepts the science. I hope you didn't vote for this man if you are convinced he is a liar.

               As for your other comments - they are simply false. The evidence linking CO2 and warming is established beyond reasonable doubt and has been known for decades. You keep asserting on this forum false and misleading statements which contradict established peer-reviewed science.

           Dermot O'Gorman of the WWF - the same organisation that contributes to the so-called 'independent' peer review process of the IPCC - fails to accept that the rest of the world is doing NOTHING toward a global agreement on (alleged) anthropogenic global warming.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The fact is atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased while global temperatures have remained flat for nearly two decades.  Neither Dermot O'Gorman nor his employer can adequately explain their insistent stance on AGW against all the empirical evidence to the contrary.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tony Abbott is right to ignore the rentseekers and carpet-baggers of the renewable energy industry and social equity lobbyists who foresee the derailment of their gravy train if the scare campaign is not maintained.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The reason why the oil price has failed to respond to the latest turmoil in Iraq is because the US no longer relies on mostly foreign oil for its energy needs.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Despite Obama's decree, cleaner coal-fired power, natural gas, oil and nuclear will still provide 93% of America's energy needs well beyond 2030.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It's laughable that the WWF is demanding that we fall into line behind an imperialist superpower on this issue. I could just imagine what their response would be if a call to arms to re-enter Iraq was issued from the Whitehouse.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The next step for the Prime Minister is to abolish the RET and stop all grants and subsidies to the renewable energy industry.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Only then will Australia be seen to be serious about removing all traces of a morally repugnant non-existent problem.

             Your absoulutely right... those quacks who reckon the world will change dramatically just because of a little more CO2 in the air are crazy.

             Good thing we have the smartest guys in the room telling us climate change is crap... lets all cut down more forests, build more roads and dig more coal to teach that stupid environment a lesson.

             Holy Sea Level Margaret, which head in sand project are you heading down?  Here in Queensland, we have experienced the hottest beginning to Winter for decades. Ask any farmer what is happening to fruit crops and other crops with unseasonal high temperatures.  Ask the people of the historic town of Grafton where entire streets and homes and people were washed away in 2011.  I could go on and on with accounts of Australians and those on small islands in our region, who have REAL experiences of extreme climate events, extreme and frequent events.   The Ice caps are melting at unprecidented rates, acidification of the oceans, warming temperatures of the oceans (look that one up) which are sending far north tropical fish and stingers into southern regions.  Some tropical species of sea life have washed up as far south as Tasmania.  There have been more frequent extreme wild fires, more frequent extreme floods  predicted by good men of science.  It is time to stop the scam Margaret.  The evidence is in.

               the upside is that we in Perth can expect an influx of Cane Toads in Perth. Our summers used to be dry heat and bearable experiences. Now they are oppressive in the extreme, humidity abounds and the night time temperature drop is becoming less and less negligible. You have to have an air conditioner just to get through summer or otherwise you suffer heat exhaustion when trying to get some shut eye.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               We have two desalination plants in WA and we are getting dryer by the year. The whole South West is going to suffer. We have had the hottest ever April, May on record and the Winter is turning into Autumn. The Clothing Retailers are beside Themselves.

               Margaret can you explain who needs Winter Fashions when their is no longer any viable Winter Season? Tell it all to the Clothing Retailers.

                 Even in the 7 years I've lived in Perth I've noticed the change in the summers from dry heat to wetter heat.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I note though, that despite our expensive desal plants desperately churning out fresh water for people living in what is effectively a desert, there are plenty of gardens all over the city crowded with water-thirsty rosebushes...

                 I guess you have seen the water guzzling gardens of those living in Mosman Park and Peppermint Grove not to mention Claremont and Nedlands and even Floreat Park and parts of Subiaco. Its a complete and obvious waste of a precious resource but do you think those residents are worried? No because they are the wealthy elites for the most who could not care less and are apt to dismiss Climate Change save for some caring professionals

           Climate change has a whole stack of talk-fests allocated to it where all the players get to expend large amounts of hot air in the cause of trying to social engineer the world.  The next big one is in Paris where they can put up the usual pointless arguments to support an ideological cause.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Putting it into G20 would just destroy the opportunity to get any useful outcome from it, and there are any number of more important things the G20 should be dealing with other than some religious cultism which is what climate change is all about

           The G20 will avoid the main issue like all other summits.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The single most important issue facing man today is population.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Last year we surpassed the threshold of not having enough resources to exploit. This is separate from irreparably damaging ecosystem and therefore not maintaining the criteria for us to flourish.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Non-economic reports (ie scientific reports) put a sustainable global population at between 1 to 4 billion with 2 billion most likely. Economics has it up to 1000 billion. One thing to remember is economics is not science, its economics.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Climate change is primarily a function of too many people with the secondary function of too much greed.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           My view is the G20 should be scraped. If its not going address the issues, its a waste of money.

             "Climate change is primarily a function of too many people"
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If this were true, then the third world countries with exploding populations would be causing the most carbon pollution.  This is not what is happening.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             China is at the top of the list, but not because their population is growing, which it isn't, but because they are far and away the largest country and rapidly modernising.  After China there is the US and the EU.  Their populations are also not growing, as in high birth rates adding to the global population but growing by immigration.  They are high contributors to global warming because of the high standard of living and therefore use of fossil fuel energy.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Population growth is a problem, but it is a different problem and being used as a "LOOK OVER THERE!!" distraction.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Population growth is generally in countries with low standards of living and low emissions and low use of the world's resources.  As their living standards rise they will then become part of the problem.  But unless you plan to nuke some 3rd world slums, the only answer is education, particularly of girls.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So, the challenge for the developed world is to find the answers to global warming they have mostly caused before the rise in living standards in the 3rd world does make their contribution disastrous.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             But stop blaming them for the problem we have now.  Our high standards of living and energy use brought this on all of us.  It is up to us to fix it.  It is definitely a topic for the G20.

              <p>
               Let me elaborate.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Australia is good for 10 million assuming we spread out and the maximum population centre is less than 500 000. In that is also livestock populations and we need to get hooved animals off of our fragile and ancient soils.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I am not looking at them. I am looking at us.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               With a 2 billion world population, of which we cut to 40% of the current, each person can then happily emit 11 tonne per head. The planet will cycle that.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               That means the third world, once depopulated, can emit 10 times more and we can emit half as much.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Now, you mention China. Not an exploding population but exploding in affluence in that their peasants are starting to burn coal for electricity. India is the same. And, as you mention, &lt;insert country here&gt; is the next time bomb, a not their fault time bomb.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So climate change is a function of too many people as I said. Too many people burning coal and oil for the sake of it and too many wanting to get a piece of the coal and oil burning action.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               How to get to less people?
               <br/>
               We need to systematically wind it down over the next 90 years. The behavioural science field can be put to work to figure that out and I am confident it can be done without killing people.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               So, the G20 needs only discuss how we get to 2 billion with developed countries also depopulating in accordance to environmental constraint.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Maybe the next G20 could then discuss how the third world shares in the pie.

             Trying to blame "too many people" for a changing climate when the climate has changed tens of thousands times over the millions of years since the Age of Dinosaurs? Eh?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             What about all the other times the climate has changed? It's been hotter, colder, changed faster too. Sea level was around 6 metres higher during the Eemian Interglacial, not that long ago really. The world didn't end then either. Nor were human factories and SUVs around, but the climate changed anyway. The Holocene was quite warm too, warmer than now, bu again there weren't any cars and factories. Seems the Earth's climate changing lots of times during the millions of years never bothers the AGW theory defenders. They'll just brush that all aside as "inconvenient".
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Scientists were estimating around a century ago that Earth could only cope with a population of 500 million, but they were proven wrong by the advancements of agriculture and other technologies. We told stories of doom in the 1960s and 1970s about overpopulation too, but those predictions too were proven wrong. Food supplies increase, and agricultural techniques improved. Urban planning has improved too, along with medicine and sanitation. Many ignorant people continue to believe (wrongly) that forests are being reduced worldwide, but that's not what's been happening. Overall, there's now more forest, more wild areas, than there were even 30 years ago, because as agricultural technologies improve, we need less farm lands globally.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             One thing to remember, even "Science" gets it wrong, because our frontiers of knowledge continue to pushed back, eventually forcing the scientific community to admit to the errors, and change with that new knowledge. Sometimes this just takes a little longer, and vested interests in the scientific community, political arena, and corporations, tend to resist it. AGW theory is based on outdated assumptions, which have proven often to be misguided at least. The computer models keep getting it wrong, and that's what happens when the wrong assumptions are built into the model. Never accept a "simulation" of reality when Reality keeps convincingly trumping the simulation's predictions.

               "Many ignorant people continue to believe (wrongly) that forests are being reduced worldwide, but that's not what's been happening. Overall, there's now more forest, more wild areas, than there were even 30 years ago..."

               <br/>
               Ahem...

               <br/>
               <br/>
               This article concludes that the rate of deforestation has decreased, although this conclusion has been disputed by other sources.  It is NOT the same as saying there has been a net reforestation rate, something no authority on deforestation has claimed.

           There can be only one reason why Abbott does not want climate change discussed and that is that he doesn't believe that it is happening.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           If he believed what he says, he would do something about it.
           <br/>

           He knows that the has to say that it's a problem or he would be laughed at by the rest of the world, but he probably thinks that it's crap.

           Climate Change is such an issue that require international coordination and finance.

             In my humble opinion he does not stand a snowball's chance in  Hell of downplaying let alone avoiding climate issues at this summit. The relentless accumulating force of International pressure will see to that. This opinion is based on a purely psychological observation: when people talk they talk about what is being talked about. And talk around global climate is everywhere you look.

           Great, let's talk about growth and the economy at the G20 meeting and not the environment. When does it dawn on Tonysaurus Rex that the environment i s the economic growth industry of this century. Renewables and alternative energy sources, weaning us off oil - these are global issues. But it is hard to see that when you have your head firmly buried in the sand.

           The mining industry don't want it on the agenda because any action will cost them money.  They own the Liberals and thus the government's position is to not have it on the agenda.

             You're probably coming close to the truth. There's little doubt that the liberal government is largely controlled by certain groups - the coal industry being one. One wonders what the party will get in return for the favours they're doing? Probably make for an interesting ICAC in a few years time.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I suspect even if Abbott leaves climate of the agenda, the other members of the G20 will ensure its spoken about behind the scenes and Abbott will pressured to ensure Australia does its fair share. I'd also wager that, in a few years time, other countries might start making action on climate change a prerequisite for other agreements.

               Well Lilly it may have something to do with the fact that for 2010-11 (ABARE) iron ore and coal accounted for 61.4% of total Australian commodity exports (A$125 billion), gold, copper, alumina and petroleum made up another A$59 billion then wheat came in at 9th, at A$6.2 billion.
               <br/>
               If you are worried about our coal just remeber that China produces 10x (3.5 Bt) what we do

           We all know what's behind Abbott's reticence to talk about climate change with the G20. It's embarrassing to make it obvious to others that you're pursing a totally selfish policy which makes Australia richer in the short term while damaging the world economy in the long term.

           What a stupid statement, as if Australian people are in control of anything here, its under the complete strangle grip of 2 corporations the ALP and LNP. Both corporations make millions of dollars through donations from miners, as if taxpayers have a say in anything that goes on here, least of all with respect to climate change.
           <br/>

             I assume you mean "borders" and not "boarders" unless you are actually discussing some kind of rental issue.

           Abbott pays no more than lip service to acknowledging AGW. His actions are 100% dedicated to denying effective action on it. Owning the G20 agenda is Abbott's form of directing collective international action as he sees fit.

           Abbott can't put climate change (that obviously has very important economic ramifications) on the agenda for the meeting, simply because for him climate change is crap, and he has been recently congratulated by the Texan Oil Industry for being a spokesperson for their interests (and those of the Australian and Canadian coal industries).... They even gave him a cow boy hat to seal the pact....Yee-ha!

           Mr Abbott has "long argued that it can only be solved through collective international action." And now, when China and America among many other nations, are not only discussing how best they can reduce carbon emissions but actually joining with concerted efforts, Mr Abbott is trying to hide this essential issue and (maybe) hide his shame.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Any reasonable person with an unbiased appreciation of the science must feel compelled to action to ameliorate climate change impacts. But Mr Abbott has committed himself and his Government to raw carbon energy matters: to support what he sees as the mainstay of our economic growth.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But Mr Abbott is not a "tech-head". He denies the value of science to the point that he has no science minister. Neither does he have an environment minister or a climate change portfolio. Environment comes into the portfolio of Agriculture! These are grave errors and the demonstrate his lack of appreciation of science and the environment.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I believe this proves Mr Abbott's incompetence as an economist as well. Science is vital to industry and economics as scientific research underpins the future development of business and economic growth.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So too climate change, as Mr O'Gorman rightly points out, will have huge impacts on our ability to manage our economy. Climatologists are indicating that we have an imminent El Nino developing with the prospect of drought looming for this coming summer. Does this not have impacts on our economy? The volatility of climate change will have even greater implications.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Mr Abbott's efforts to reject science and particularly climate science and economists opinions demonstrate his commitment to coal. Is this not myopic? Does it not show his ignorance?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           This is is not simply an issue for greenies or loony lefties. We cannot afford to ignore what the rest of the world is taking so seriously. He is rejecting his own commitment to joining "collective international action".

             This year 50 countries attended the annual CO2 gobfest about plant food.

             Obviously the left dont do numbers as according to the foremost world temperature data sets there has been no warming for at the last 17 years plus.

                 Jerry is right, John: check the data indeed! But hey, here is the data for you, read and learn (once and for all!):
                 <br/>
                 Over the long-term the warming continues relentlessly. Even the mythical "hiatus" that conveniently is given the starting point in 1998 is false. Since 1998 there has only been a slow down in warming. In fact the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the temperature anomaly and time for the three major global temperatures datasets is positive between 1998 and 2013:
                 <br/>
                 MetOffice/HadCRUT4: +0.29
                 <br/>
                 NOAA/NCDC: +0.28
                 <br/>
                 NASA/GISS: +0.39
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The mythical maximum temperature reached in 1998 was broken in 2010... so the "hiatus" only lasted about 12 years which, SURPRISE!, is roughly the time for a solar radiation cycle.
                 <br/>
                 Do you understand now, John?

             The liberal/ nationals main policy is Everyman for himself and the devil take the hindmost. Abbot and his followers are like those that said Hitler wouldn't strike they are denying the obvious. The nationals have let down the country constituents by agreeing to the fuel tax and PPL nonsense. Country Labor now needs to drive home it's the only party that can support country folk .Bill Shorten will have to consolidate his policies quickly and quietly. Now we know the lib/ Nat policies they are very easy targets.Climate change policies with substance need to be put in place for country electorates as they will be most effected by climate insecurity.

             I know it's useless to say this but I just can't help myself: Go look at the data!  Check the past 50 years carbon dioxide emmission (measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii) and compare them with the preceding 50 years' data.

               When you refer to Moana Loa then you prove conclusively that you are deceived.

               <br/>
               The data from Moana Loa are corrupted, contaminated and fiddled so as to get the desired end result.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The air sampled at the observatory is a mixture of ambient air, volcanic emissions and jet plane exhaust gases. Keeling has admitted this, but claims to have adjusted the readings so as to compensate. But what he won't do is release his raw data, tell us how he distinguishes one form of pollution from another, how much of each contaminant he has detected and what process he uses to prepare his end result.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Without that information his claims are rubbish - and he knows it, which is why he will not co-operate with other scientists and provide the base data.

                 "At night a temperature inversion forms near the ground, trapping volcanic emissions coming from Mauna Loa summit fumarloes in a layer tens of meters thick. Down slope winds sometimes transport these emissions to the observatory, where they are detected as a "noisy" increase above smooth baseline levels for some gases. A volcanic component can be estimated by taking the difference in concentration between periods when the plume is present and periods "

                 It's unfortunate that the levels of complexity in any assessment of global phenomena make it difficult to communicate an explanation to those who don't want to hear it.

                 What is not perfectly acceptable is Keeling's refusal to set out what amount of CO2 is transported, how he knows that, how he measures it, how he distinguishes it from other contaminants and what adjustments he has made to his raw data.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The Moana Loa observatory is located only about 24km from an open volcanic fissure that emits volcanic CO2 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. That is not transported by winds. But what are transported by the prevailing winds are the fumes and exhaust emissions from the jet planes using any one of Hawaii's three international airports. That is what Keeling collates, and it is what he assiduously keeps from scientific enquiry.

             The very fact that we are the hosts gives us a bit of weight in an event like this, in terms of setting the agenda and having some cause to talk ourselves up.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             To be seen to be essentially back-chatting the other delegates by refusing to talk about what is to them an important issue is a bad first start.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             You may think that we Australians don't need any international "street cred" to get by, but that's only because we have existed for so long with excellent "street cred" courtesy of Mother England and being, well, white and rich.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I posit that were that cred to actually disintegrate, many pooh-poohers of it's necessity would suddenly find it very lacking and be anxious for it's return...
             <br/>
             <br/>
             What do you do when other countries don't want Australians immigrating there? When they refuse to enter into trade agreements with us that are on our terms? When any disagreement between them and us becomes an issue for military posturing instead of just banter?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             That sort of thing happens to countries all over the world every day, you think just because it's NEVER happened in Australia yet that it never will?

           The G20 may not be the place to discuss climate change per se, but there's a great opportunity being missed by ruling it out entirely.  China and the US are both working at developing alternative energy production, with the US definitely worried that China's advances will make them the leader and thus dominate the global economy, selling their expertise and products to everyone else.  We could be getting in on this, creating jobs, increasing productivity, but instead we're dragging our feet, pretending it's not an issue, preferring to sell the coal we can dig up while we still can.  Fair enough, as far as that goes, but if we're not preparing now then when China doesn't need our coal or even needs it less, we're going to be in trouble.  Meanwhile, cuts to CSIRO, the effective elimination of a science ministry, climate change denial, these are the policies we think want?

             I'm sorry to say that I'm not amazed at the intransigence of some individuals.
             <br/>
             For those CC deniers I ask,"What would it actually take for you to acknowedge Climate Change is real; and that human activity contributes to it".
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As someone has already alluded to in the above posts, saying something many times with conviction, doesn't make it right, if it isn't.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             That was regarding the last paragraph, which is repeated ad nauseum by those with nothing else to cling to, without actually providing a skeric of proof.
             <br/>
             You're going to jump straight to recent the period of no warming? We're actually talking about trends, and 17 years  in climate study is less than a heartbeat.
             <br/>
             As for the rest, don't just say it, back it up, reference it. That way the validity of the reference can also be evaluated. You're the one making the sweeping statements with not even an attempt at justification.
             <br/>
             It's just an open invitation for someone to call you on it. Which puts you in the classification of the 'articulate, but ignorant'.

               I do acknowledge that the climate changes and has since time began.That humans are influencing it in any meaningful way is another story.

               <br/>
               Right back at you.What would it take for you to acknowledge that the climate change we are having is natural.If we are affecting the climate how will we know that any action we take,reducing CO2 in the atmosphere seems to be it at present,is working.What will be the sign.

               How about the IPCC will they do they have acknowledged that there has been a PAUSE in the temp rise that their very expensive computers did not forcast.So what else has the computer models failed to take into account.

                 Your belief is based on one event that wasn't predicted which you think invalidates all other predictions? Incredible. I deal a lot with religious people with magical thinking so I won't waste my time trying the discuss it further.

                 The models didn't get much of anything predicted right. They didn't just fail to predict the lack of warming, they also wildly over-estimated all of the doomsday scenarios as if built upon forcings and false assumptions that would result in such a bias. Many of those assumptions should be admitted as plain WRONG. However, it appears from the response of the AGW crowd when their holy silicon gods and their white robed priests of the IPCC get things wrong, the believers go into a frenzy, shouting down and insulting with more viciousness any person who dares mention the failings of their Faith.

                 Only if you have try to imagine that "broadly" includes zero increase in warming. There's been no warming since the mid-1990s, and that's not the only prediction that the alarmists' models got wrong. Worse, are the lies trying to pretend their prophecies of doom are proving correct when very clearly they are not.

               1880 was, give or take a decade or two, not only the time that records began to be kept but also the end of the last little ice age.

               As the end of an ice age is something like 4 degrees Celsius lower than the end of a warm age, the globe is, solely and only by natural forces, slowly warming. As it will inevitably and inexorably do, regardless of what humanity does or does not do.

                 John the little ice age was just as the name suggests, little, NOT a proper ice age as you imply. Temps in the northern hemisphere were less than 1 deg C below the 1000 year average in Europe and parts of the southern hemisphere but in Asia there was  little if any effect. It was likely caused by the combination of a maunder (solar) minimum and increased volcanic activity.

Note that John's argument relies on failing to make the distinction between the so-called "little ice age" (a slight drop in global temperatures caused by a lull in sunspot activity) and the true ice age (large temperature drop caused by eccentricities in the Earth's orbit - see Milankovitch cycle for more information).

                 <br/>
                 Well, that is exactly zero scientists. Scientists are salaried employees. It is true that they apply for research grants when they want to conduct particular research. But this is very different than needing grants so they can put food on their table.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But let me assume for the sake of argument that you are not completely wrong about how scientists are remunerated. Your implication that there is a massive global conspiracy where the scientific community are either willing participants, or blackmailed into going along with it so they don't lose the grants they apparently depend on to feed themselves, is nuclear powered, face-palming tin foil hattery conspiracy theory nonsense. I suspect that you have never actually met a scientist.

                 Evan, if you discount the "scientists" in the pay of the fossil fuel companies, you'll find most of us depend on grants for a living (although not all of us who understand AGW and know it's a problem work in environmental science, that's only a fraction of us).

           Tony Abbot can't afford to have the G 20 adopt a unified stance on climate change because he then can't argue against it. Abbot  and Hunt are Clayton's environmentalists and are living in the 80s like fools . Australia will miss out on much new technology advances and new jobs all because a P M can see political gain. Well it won't be long before Tonys deck of cards comes crashing down. Turnbull and Palmer have sensed a kill in the wind and Tony won't last past November . This latest stunt with the G20 could even hasten the event.

           Abbott doesn't want climate change on the G20 agenda because his backers, the big fossil fuel polluters, don't want it on the agenda.  If it is on the agenda then his backers may face more restrictions on their CO2 polluting industries and it is their man, Tony Abbott's job to prevent that from happening.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So it's  the big polluters vs the good of the planet.  We know which side Abbott is on.  The question is, is the rest of the world more powerful than the fossil fuel industry?  Surely it is.  It had better be, or we and our planet are in big trouble.

           "The promotion of growth through trade that is equitable is most likely to be the main topic at the G20".
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The trouble is that Abbott and the coalition would not know an equitable trade agreement if it jumped out and bit them.  Not one of the so called 'Free Trade Agreements' a misnomer in terms, they signed including the one with the US, have any real equity in them.   As far as I can see we well and truly got done over on them getting little, most of it off in never never land, for what we gave up.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I suppose they can talk about how good they are at selling Australia out just so they can get an agreement.  And I suppose we will hear about all of Abbott's best mates.  I wonder what list in order he will put them in.  Or, will he just tell them all what he thinks they want to here like he does to us and than do the opposite.  I wonder if what they say will come under 'operational matters' and we won't be told.

           Lord protect us from the morons in our parliament.  Other countries now sanction polluters and we the tax payers of Australia are now required to subsidise them.  No wonder Abbott wants emissions off the G20 agenda.  They would look like the fools they are.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Any sanguine investment adviser will now tell you to get out of anything to do with coal.  Our former customers certainly are.  Australia now has no manufacturing industry in cars, ships or anything substantial.  We dig and sell dirt.  Not for long unfortunately.

           C'mon all you warmenistas, the Anthropogenic Global Warming doctrine was that all the heat would muster in the mid-troposphere, particularly over the tropics. It didn't. Hence Trenberth's anguish. Where could it be? Oh dear it is clearly in the ocean depths. Snuck down there by some mystery and while we can't measure it accurately, trust us it's down there and now it is Catastrophic Climate Change. All those Kelvins waiting to assault us. Game over, warmies. Germany has gone back to Kaiser Kohl, Japan has said POQ, Russia laughs, India won't have a bar of it, Canada and Oz stand together against The Giggle, The Laugh. Bit by bit your bandwagon and milch cow are being destroyed. Well done though to those who sucked the public tit dry while they could - Rainman Flannery in particular is my hero in that regard!

           If I remember correctly he was anti g20 when labor pushed for and got it, now both he and hockey think they are something special, lets face facts, abbott has as much control over economic's as he does over climate change, but let him have a play at being Pm while he can.

           Maybe somebody should have told the leaders of the other 19 member countries that the adults are in charge over here and they'll have to do what they're told.

           <br/>
           I'm guessing that there's going to be two G20 meetings this year: one being a serious international discussion covering a range of topics, and one for Mr Abbott to play with.

           Why should climate change be on the table with the G20?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In Forbes Magazine (not really a Leftie-Greenie Rag) 18 May 2014 in an article entitled
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Rift Widening Between Energy And Insurance Industries Over Climate Change"
           <br/>
           <br/>
           - a couple of quotes would show why.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Being a big business, the insurance industry is a strong backer of free enterprise and its laissez-faire leaders. But a rift could be developing now that some major carriers are staking claims in the climate change cause while many of their congressional backers have remained skeptical of the science.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           For insurers, it's not about the political machinations but rather, it's about the potential economic losses. If even part of the predictions hold ? the ones released by the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change that ascribe temperature change to humans with 95 percent certainty ? then the rate of extreme weather events will only increase and the effects would be more severe. That, in turn, would lead to greater damages and more payouts.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "The heavy losses caused by weather-related natural catastrophes in the USA showed that greater loss-prevention efforts are needed," says Munich Re board member Torsen Jeworrek."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And for those who have faith in credit ratings:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Meantime, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services just issued a report saying that the credit ratings of sovereign countries would be affected by global warming. It pointed to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, heavy flooding in Great Britain and the record cold temperatures this past winter in the United States, all of which caused economic damages and disrupted business practices."
           <br/>

            <p>
             Since the insurance industry is now starting to take notice of (ie worry about) human ascribed climate change, I wonder how long it will take until insurance premiums on say houses and/or motor vehicles will have a discounted percentage for those properties or vehicles which have a "green" factor?  If if a house has solar panels or a car is hybrid or even fully electric the owner will be charged less for insurance?  Sounds reasonable.

           This is outrageous. One can only ask can things get worse? What's needed is all those concerned to protest at the G20. I suggest all those concerned from around the world and Australians living interstate get on planes and fly over to protest at the conference. Of course all those who live closer can drive their Suv's or 4wd's to meet up and protest about the lack of action on climate change. Then again some might think that those demanding change, change their own way of lives and lead by example living a more simple life but of course they can't do that can they. It is far easier to demand that others do something, turn up and protest, write messages on facebook or twitter complaining about the lack of action but then fly off overseas on a holiday or drive everywhere in their 4wd's and Suv's, upgrade their mobile phone every year to the best and latest to keep up with all their environmental concerned friends and get the biggest and best television they can. But that what climate change is all about hypocrisy from those who fear for the future of the planet demanding change but refusing to change their own ways.

             It'll certainly have far more beneficial effects on our environment than carbon tax.  Actually, anyone, who has not been totally brainwashed by the carbon political propaganda, would know that trees are, the best, most effective and most environment friendly carbon storages. Therefore, you should congratulate Tony Abbott on such great initiative rather than sneering at it.

           Move along, nothing to see here. The best thing you can do when your major trading partners are undergoing significant change is to hold your nerve and keep doing what you've always done. No need to change, become a beacon of stability. The world will surely reward you for such forethought and shower you with much glory and success.

           The only  thing  that  I  agree  with  Mr Abbott on.
           <br/>
           Climate change  and  CO2   are a  scam.  Climate  change  is put  up  by  the  world  elite  to  control  the  masses, change  technology etc.  If  climate  change  is  real??,  then  I  may  believe   CO   as a  possible, because  CO  is  man made.
           <br/>
           The  worlds  weather  over  the  last  2000  years  would  be  nice  to  study,  forget  man in that  picture.
           <br/>
           There  are  more things  in this  world  of  greater  importance,  food  without  being  poisoned (GMO)    and  the  TONS  of  lead   being  dropped  on us  by  aircraft.

           The climate change debate is principally about whether humanity via industrial processes and economic development is creating an adverse change in climate. Therefore to say that a climate change debate is not relevant for the G20 is Abbotts way of saying he does not believe climate change is manmade and therefore is irrelevant. He cant have his cake and eat it too.

           The sooner 'climate change' as defined by the climate zealots is off everyone's agenda the better. Of course climates change and of course extra CO2 warms the Globe slightly - other things being equal. But none of this is bad. As Nobel Laureate Arrhenius foresaw, more CO2 is and will continue to be good.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           That good is massively increased by the prime function of atmospheric CO2, i.e. feeding plants and promoting their growth. When CO2 tops out around .06% by volume later this century its profound good effect will have been recognised and we will be keen to maintain it around that level.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I look forward to my 11 grandchildren benefiting greatly from more abundant CO2.

             Oh not, the "CO2 is food for plants" crap again. Hey JR, please do learn about the effects of CO2 on climate: increased droughts in some areas, increased floods in other areas, increased large magnitude hurricanes in tropical areas, increased storm surges in coastal areas, increased high intensity bushfires, spread of diseases, etc..... all that will affect the life of 7 billion people by increasing regional conflicts, and the movement of people around the globe escaping both the effects of climate (such as famine) and the political turmoil..... This is happening and will continue to happen without the need to reach stratospheric CO2 levels and extraordinary high atmospheric temperatures... just a few degrees are and will continue to be bad enough.

               Well tried, Alpo.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The "global warming" scare didn't have much effect, so the alarmists made it "catastrophic global warming". When the globe didn't warm catastrophically they changed it to "climate change". When they got egg all over their faces and realised that the climate always has changed, they switched the attack to "extreme weather events".
               <br/>
               <br/>
               You've got to do better. The "extreme" weather events have not materialised and the threats of droughts and floods have been sheepishly retracted by the IPCC:
               <br/>
               <br/>
               " No significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency...";
               <br/>
               " ... does not support AR4 conclusions regarding global increasing trends in droughts...";
               <br/>
               " ... a low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale...";
               <br/>
               " ... there is currently no clear and widespread evidence for observed changes in flooding".
               <br/>
               <br/>
               All that from the embarrassing AR5 report.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Quick, Alpo, think of something else. Perhaps the Ebola virus is caused by CO2. Or AIDS.

           How exactly can Abbott tell 19 leaders what they can and cannot talk about at the G20?
           <br/>
           He may temporarily hold the Liberal Party leadership thanks to support from Climate Change deniers and Peter Slipper, but that is not the fault of the G20.
           <br/>
           They are flying around the globe, and what do they talk about?
           <br/>
           Apparently not the weather. That's Climate Change.
           <br/>
           And ceratinly not the economy. That's dependent on Climate Change being addressed.
           <br/>
           Maybe they can a group hug and piss off to the beach instead.
           <br/>
           Unless the cyclones are early again or the stingers and Irukandji have drifted south again. Which is due to Climate Change.

           The G20 is not interested in carbon dioxide or Co2 emissions per se, but upon the economic and political impacts of CO2e on their member states.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Dealing with the consequences of Anthropogenic climate change is something the G20 can be a key player in, as it brings together the big economies who can actually shape policy for 85% of the global economy or potentially more.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There are consequences for the economic activity that create and currently maintain our high living standards, and there are consequences for not addressing emerging or exacerbating problems. Or we can pretend that there is nothing to see, that we are doomed or we have no impact on our world like the climates change apocolypticians  or the AGW flat-earth denialists.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Maybe some of these people are right and the market an't do anything...which is code for pretending there are no AGW consequences o human activity or that a big strong world government will fix it for us.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           These people need to stop dropping the little "e", look at what the science tells about what we can know, what we can do and what we need to do.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The "e" is the missing part as in carbon dioxide equivalence, which is why AGW is not just about greater concentrations of CO2 and good for growing bigger tomatoes.....

           Time to react to the article rather than to the reactions.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Thanks Dermot.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           To answer the key question of your article, which has been smothered by comment: Abbott wants to avoid talking about climate change for the same reason I don't like talking about alcoholism. It cuts a bit too close to the bone.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I will admit that alcohol may be a problem for some people, but you probably won't hear me confess that it's a problem for me. Even if I have to get up during the night (and fall over), and maybe I miss the odd day at work, and sometimes my kidneys can be heard chatting to each other. There's the possibility that I may have destroyed relationships with people I cared about, or had the occasional motorbike accident.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Abbott is definitely at step 0. "What carbon pollution?" This is a man who believes in an invisible, weightless, odourless God but doesn't believe billions of tonnes of CO2 tossed into the atmosphere each year could possibly have some sort of impact on the planet's kidneys.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chances are, by the time the G20 meets in Brisbane in November, we'll be enduring a brutal El Nino. A bit like the time I woke up in hospital after deciding it was a great idea to take my motorbike for a ride at 4am without a helmet. It might be a wake-up call for him - his first AA meeting, if you like.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The big difference? I'm really only a danger to myself. They're my kidneys. I don't have to share them with seven billion other people - thankfully.

             Hi Ricardo, thanks for your endearing frankness and the offering up of an interesting and somewhat amusing metaphor.
             <br/>
             I take it as a confessional insight into mind-in-denial and also the erratic and  slow process of recovering reality bytes in incremental steps.
             <br/>
             When the stakes are high (health), that is when denial is most likely to shut down our own overwhelmed senses  . But the individual who can open himself to friendship will still pull through in the end. Not so much giving in to group pressure,  the process happens more by way of a collective and collaborative  group awareness.  Call it AA if you like. The awareness shifting principle applies  much just as much to international citizens as it does to private ones.

           "...Abbott MUST put climate change on G20 agenda...", so says Dermot O'Gorman.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The arrogance of the brainwashed warmists is breathtaking.  The do not want to talk, discuss or debate. They demand!!!    And... our ABC publishes and promotes such unreasonable and offensive articles.  Out of so many extremely important issues affecting todays world such as; World trade, economics, security etc, Dermot O'Gorman and our ABC demand that their pet project becomes the main issue for such important meeting. Fortunately, we have the Prime Minister who is strong enough to dismiss such arrogant and ridiculous demands. The majority of Australians are with him!!!

           Of all the issues to be dealt with by the G20 climate change is a minor matter. You people have pushed this climate change nonsense to the point where no one is interested any more...it's boring!

             INCORRECT!.... Global warming has continued unabated, including the period starting in 1998 (the fantasy "hiatus"). In fact, the record global atmospheric warming was broken in 2010!! and from 1998 to 2013 the trend in warming is positive according to the three major international climate centres (the UK MetOffice, NASA and NOAA)... and the record warming could be broken again in 2014.... Don't book any skiing resort in Australia this season, unless you want to ski on pebbles.

               Is that why the the likes of Hansen and Jones have stated there is a pause? Or perhaps the IPCC has got its numbers wrong again when it mentions the hiatus saying:
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "including the warming hiatus since 1998"
               <br/>
               <br/>
               or is quoted as:
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "Both satellites and surface records show that sometime around 2000, temperature data ceased its upward path and leveled off."
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Ch 9 of the IPCC report shows the hiatus and the models diverging from the actual T measures using Hadcrut4.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               It would not be wise to throw away those blankets just yet; wait a few hundred years.

           There's science and political science. Blend the two and we have real problems. The best scientists on earth are Sen Milne, Adam Bandt, Al Gore and Pres. Obama.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           These together with the writer turn orthodox science on its head. Only in this political world could assertions be science.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Assertions include "..of the pollution that is causing the earth to warm"  Really?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Even a two-degree increase in global temperatures - which we are currently on track to surpass-.." Is that why there has been a 17 year hiatus? So CO2 takes rests and unpaid holidays too!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           All the models based on the CO2 conjecture have failed; keep the faith. Ultimately in science it is the empirical evidence which should speak; everything else is just basically thought bubbles. The empirical evidence falsifies the alarmist proposal; most predictions have failed to materialize.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In true science we should turn to empirical evidence which is consistent and supports an assertion. In politics we don't care. In that sense you are right that PM Abbott might need to play the political game. It would be nice if you did not confuse the two.
