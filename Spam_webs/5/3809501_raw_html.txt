         Book Sales May be Much Greater than Previously Thought
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In a report whose findings are sure to be questioned by many in the industry, the Book Industry Study Group has issued a report that says book sales have been seriously underreported. The study, Under the Radar, says that approximately 63,000 publishers with annual sales of less than $50 million generate aggregate sales of $14.2 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff Abraham, executive director of BISG, says that while some of that revenue is represented in current industry sales estimateswhich puts revenue at between $23.7 billion and $28.5 billiona significant portion of the revenue is not. Abraham says the discrepancy between the findings of Under the Radar and historical industry measurements is that the study tracked sales from companies whose main business is outside of book publishing. The study also found that the majority of sales made by midsized and smaller publishers are made outside of traditional bookselling channels such as non-book wholesalers who serve outlets such as sporting goods stores.
       </p>
       <p>
        Abraham says he plans to put together an industry task force that will work to find a process that can combine the findings of Under the Radar with traditional industry measurements.

        China publishes around 200,000 new titles and new editions a year. It is by far the largest publishing market by volume - officially about 6bn units a year, but many more when pirated copies are taken into account. In terms of value the market will probably amount to around 4-5bn in 2007, which would put it fourth in the world - behind the US, Germany and Japan and ahead of the UK.

        Making #2 at Amazon.
        <br/>
        Total sales for the week of the Amazon campaign were 2294 copies for the
        <i>
         Biology of Belief
        </i>
        . It took sales of more than 1,000 to drive the book to number two. (A Harry Potter book was first)
       </p>
       <p>
        Thereafter, sales of only 100 a day or thereabouts were needed to maintain it there! I suspect this has to do with the algorithms Amazon uses to prevent wild fluctuations of the list.

        1993-2003: The number of titles published increased 58% while fiction readers declines 14%,

        2004. 56.6% of adult Americans said they read at least one book, fiction or non-fiction, between August 2001 and August 2002 compared to 60.9% ten years prior.
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of adults engaged in reading literature--defined as novels, short stories, plays and poetry, and a focus of the study--was 46.7% in 2002, down from 54% in 1992 and 56.9% in 1982.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1982 literary reading fell in virtually all groups and segments. By age, the rate of decline is steepest among young adults, with the percentage of 18 to 24 year olds that describe themselves as reading literature falling to 42.8% in 2002 from 59.8% in 1982. The percentage of 25 to 34 year olds fell from 62.1% in 1982 to 47.7% in 2002.
       </p>
       <p>
        While women still read more literature than men, that percentage fell to 55.1% in 2002 from 63% in 1982. The study also found that only 37.6% of men read literature in 2002, down from 49.1% in 1982.
        <br/>
        Meanwhile, the percentage of whites that read literature in 2002 was 51.4% in 2002, down from 59.8% in 1982, while 37.1% of African-Americans and 26.5% of Hispanics read literature in 2002. In 1982 those numbers were at 42.3% for African-Americans and 36.4% for Hispanics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the percentage of Hispanics and African-Americans that read literature declined between 1982 and 2002, because of the increase in population the number of those readers actually rose. The gain is particularly striking among Hispanics, with the study finding that the number of Hispanic adult readers totaled 6 million in 2002, up from 3.4 million in 1982 and 5.2 million in 1992.

        Last spring (1999) an uneasy Authors Guild, which had spent more than a year looking into these trends, released its report on midlist publishing. It laboriously toted up the figures for the top fiction and nonfiction titles on the Publishers Weekly annual bestseller list, then showed how those 30 megabooks suck up a growing proportion of sales. In 1986, the bestsellers accounted for about 7 percent of all adult hardcover trade book sales; a decade later they accounted for 13 percent. In 1999, applying the same methodology, the proportion reached nearly 15 percent.

        In 2000, John Grisham's "The Brethren" sold 2.8 million books.
