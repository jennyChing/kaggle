Which is surprising, since the novels have been well reviewed, avidly marketed, and abundantly sold. Yet they have been oddly absent from the radar screens of many who consider themselves aficionados of the contemporary novel.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This trilogy takes on nothing less than the intertwined dangers of ecological and social collapse, envisioning the horrifying near-future, post-apocalyptic consequences of unchecked corporate culture and scientific experimentation. But Atwood masterfully realizes this big picture through the telling (and occasionally hilarious) detail, with vivid characters, gripping plots, and complex narrative structures that subtly reflect the fundamental connection between human consciousness and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The final installment, &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam,&lt;/i&gt; is not the strongest of the three, but it deftly pulls together various threads left loose in &lt;i&gt;Oryx and Crake&lt;/i&gt; (2003) and &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Flood&lt;/i&gt; (2009). The two earlier volumes were \u201csimultanequels,\u201d a term Atwood coined to distinguish them from the linear sequencing of prequels and sequels. &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam &lt;/i&gt;begins where the cliffhangers of the two previous volumes ended: with the world precariously balanced between the few remaining survivors of the human race and the transhumans bioengineered to be their successors. This novel narrates the immediate destinies of the preceding volumes\u2019 main characters and sketches the likely future of humanity and posthumanity. But here, as in the first two volumes of the trilogy, Atwood devotes as much time to the past as to the future.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=\"nonindented quote\"&gt;The novel traces the picaresque wanderings of Zeb through the varied wildernesses of the pre-apocalyptic Western hemisphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even readers of those previous volumes may need some plot summary to orient them in this new work, which promotes a minor character from &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Flood&lt;/i&gt; to the status of titular protagonist and fills in his backstory. MaddAddam is Zeb, the leader of a resistance group dedicated to battling the bioengineering corporations known as the Corps, who are policed by their own private militias, the CorpSeCorps. At least that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the MaddAddamites\u2019 mission before they were conscripted to work for Crake, the mad scientist responsible for the viral pandemic that killed off most of the human race, as well as for the creation of their bioengineered replacements\u2014a trusting, inquisitive, and uncannily beautiful species known as the Children of Crake or, less formally, the Crakers.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the previous two volumes, we only glimpsed the MaddAddamites from a distance, and this novel doesn\u2019t tell us much more about their methods or group dynamics. Rather, it tells the story of how Zeb became Zeb. His bildungsroman begins, in classic fashion, with an abusive childhood, which is mitigated only by the companionship of an older half brother, Adam. We are not surprised to learn that this Adam grows up to be &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Flood&lt;/i&gt;\u2019s \u201cAdam One,\u201d the leader of a religious sect called God\u2019s Gardeners, whose members practice vegetarianism and nonviolence and avoid using new technology. Atwood details the sadistic treatment the boys suffered at the hands of their father, who leads a fundamentalist megachurch devoted to the worship of fossil fuels, and the revenge they exact before fleeing home.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel then traces the picaresque wanderings of Zeb through the varied wildernesses of the pre-apocalyptic Western hemisphere. He works as a pilot for Bearlift, a well-meaning but misguided save-the-bears operation high in the mountains of the Canadian Yukon and&nbsp;then as a magician\u2019s assistant in Southern California\u2019s Floating World, an urban district whose&nbsp;name&nbsp;evokes both illicit pleasures (a reference to the \u201cfloating world\u201d culture of fashion, entertainment, and prostitution in Japan's Edo period) and rising sea levels.&nbsp;Zeb next works as a hacker-for-hire, employed by various criminal enterprises and based in Rio de Janeiro, now known as \u201cthe Wild West of the web.\u201d In this novel, as in the two previous volumes of the trilogy, Atwood\u2019s satirical portrayal of the near future is as entertaining as it is incisive in its critique of our contemporary moment\u2019s volatile mix of religious fundamentalism, neoliberal profiteering, and environmental degradation.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Biochemisty lab. Photograph by Baitaal / Wikimedia Commons\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://public-books-01.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/029d15f9-8bee-41bc-aea4-ca0d4e6e1ce2.jpg\" height=\"373\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraternal relationship between Adam and Zeb\u2014Zeb attributes their \u201ccute A-Z name symmetry\u201d to their father, who \u201cliked to theme-park everything\u201d\u2014is deliberately conventional. Light versus dark, methodical versus impulsive, saintly versus sinful: the formulaic polarity of &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt;\u2019s brothers recalls the paired brothers (Charles and Adam, Cal and Aron) in Steinbeck\u2019s generational chronicle &lt;i&gt;East of Eden,&lt;/i&gt; and, like Steinbeck, Atwood allegorically\u2014or perhaps just flat-footedly\u2014invokes that originary pair of belligerent brothers, Cain and Abel.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adam and Zeb also echo the male antagonists of &lt;i&gt;Oryx and Crake&lt;/i&gt;, similarly yoked by loyalty, manipulation, and betrayal. Their agonistic bond, however, is much less compelling than the one at the heart of that earlier volume. Despite Atwood\u2019s attempts to invest Zeb with internal complexity in the form of passion and doubts, he remains a kind of action figure, an adventure romance hero largely defined by feats of derring-do at the computer keyboard, in mortal combat with man and beast, and in the sack. His physical prowess and survivalist skills come in especially handy at the novel\u2019s climax, which features an epic battle between Zeb\u2019s band of survivors and a violent remnant of the old human society\u2014the two Painballers who were captured at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Flood&lt;/i&gt; but manage to escape at the opening of this volume.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=\"nonindented quote\"&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s the story, then there\u2019s the real story, then there\u2019s the story of how the story came to be told.\u201d&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although Zeb\u2019s character remains fairly two-dimensional, the way that Atwood alternates between the pre-apocalyptic past and the post-apocalyptic present puts a far more interesting frame around Zeb\u2019s ultimately superficial tale. &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam &lt;/i&gt;filters the story of Zeb\u2019s past through two post-apocalyptic viewpoints: that of Toby, a former God\u2019s Gardener who joins forces with the few other human survivors of the pandemic, and that of the Crakers, the gentle tribe of transhuman hybrids who avidly weave Zeb\u2019s personal history, as retold by Toby, into a creation myth.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt;\u2019s narrative is thus split between Zeb\u2019s story as he relays it to Toby, who becomes his lover, and the version of that story that Toby tells the Crakers, who insist that she become their bard and protector-in-chief. \u201cThere\u2019s the story, then there\u2019s the real story, then there\u2019s the story of how the story came to be told. Then there\u2019s what you leave out of the story. Which is part of the story too.\u201d That is how Atwood\u2019s third-person narrator reflects upon the difference between what Toby hears from Zeb and what she sees fit to tell the Crakers, whose childlike curiosity outstrips their understanding of abstract concepts such as evil, or even such fundamental notions as human aggression or private property. This meta-reflection on the limits of narrative representation and the vicissitudes of its transmission joins &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt; to the two novels that precede it in the trilogy and to Atwood\u2019s novelistic oeuvre as a whole.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;Although Atwood\u2019s metafictional bent allies her with postmodern heavy hitters such as Philip Roth and Thomas Pynchon, she has more often been considered in the company of writers such as Doris Lessing and Ursula LeGuin who have used the conventions of fantasy to explore the gendered norms and sexual desires that shape women\u2019s lives. From her earliest, more realistic work, beginning with &lt;i&gt;The Edible Woman&lt;/i&gt; in the late 1960s and &lt;i&gt;Surfacing&lt;/i&gt; in the early \u201970s, Atwood\u2019s fiction has highlighted the challenges of telling stories of identity and connection in a world of unequal power relations.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While these tensions inflect her entire oeuvre\u2014more than 50 volumes of fiction, poetry, and essays\u2014they are most vividly dramatized in &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid\u2019s Tale&lt;/i&gt; (1985). This dystopian speculative novel is narrated by a reproductive surrogate slave who describes her subjection and resistance to a fundamentalist authoritarian regime, a future era that is a throwback to a nightmarish Puritan past. The fictional world of this \u201chandmaid,\u201d replete with her flashbacks to a pre-apocalyptic \u201ctime before,\u201d forms a significant precursor to the post-apocalyptic world of Atwood\u2019s 21st-century trilogy. &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid\u2019s Tale&lt;/i&gt; has been adapted for stage, opera, and radio, and film, including a 1990 Hollywood movie that was disappointing despite a stellar cast and a screenplay by Harold Pinter. The most brilliant, best-selling, and canonical of Atwood\u2019s 14 novels, there have been repeated attempts to ban &lt;i&gt;Handmaid&lt;/i&gt; from high school and even college curricula\u2014an ironic fate, given the novel\u2019s searing critique of censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=\"nonindented quote\"&gt;The framing of the story draws together the narrative and the criminal senses of what it means to frame or be framed.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Atwood was nominated for the Booker Prize for &lt;i&gt;Handmaid&lt;/i&gt;, and again for each of the three novels she published after that, but she did not win this honor until &lt;i&gt;The Blind Assassin&lt;/i&gt; in 2000. Set in 1930s and \u201940s Canada, &lt;i&gt;The Blind Assassin&lt;/i&gt; might well be categorized as historical fiction, though this label does not adequately account for its nested, multi-generic structure. Its framing family saga contains a love story, which, in turn, contains a science fiction story that culminates in an attack on the planet Zycron by the Lizard Men of Xenor. The pulpy tale embedded at the heart of the novel is precisely the sort of sci-fi\u2014complete with \u201ctalking squids in outer space\u201d\u2014that Atwood infamously distinguished from her own brand of \u201cspeculative fiction.\u201d{{f}}&nbsp;Her brand, she claimed, extrapolates from actually existing conditions into the near future. According to Atwood, \u201cScience fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.\u201d{{f}}&nbsp;Her dismissal of SF roused the resentment (still simmering) of that genre\u2019s fans, but Atwood ultimately downplayed the contretemps as a mere matter of nomenclature: \u201cIn short, what Le Guin means by \u2018science fiction\u2019 is what I mean by \u2018speculative fiction,\u2019 and what she means by \u2018fantasy\u2019 would include some of what I mean by \u2018science fiction.\u2019 So that clears it all up, more or less.\u201d{{f}}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Though diehard SF fans have not been mollified by her efforts at rapprochement, it is worth noting that the real crisis in &lt;i&gt;The Blind Assassin &lt;/i&gt;does not hinge on pinpointing the genre to which the intergalactic story belongs, but on the identity of the sister who authored the love story nested within the novel and, hence, on the question of which sister actually had the illicit love affair that the tale describes. The framing of the story draws together the narrative and the criminal senses of what it means to frame or be framed. In this regard, &lt;i&gt;The Blind Assassin&lt;/i&gt; resembles Atwood\u2019s other work of historical fiction, &lt;i&gt;Alias Grace &lt;/i&gt;(1996), which is presented from the complex and ultimately irreconcilable viewpoints of a convicted murderess and that of the \u201calienist\u201d doctor who researches her case. \u201cThere\u2019s the story, then there\u2019s the real story, then there\u2019s the story of how the story came to be told. Then there\u2019s what you leave out of the story. Which is part of the story too.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;The narrative framing of &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam &lt;/i&gt;is what gives this novel, like Atwood\u2019s other novels, its vitality. The satirical realism of Zeb\u2019s life story\u2014as told to Toby in the form of postcoital pillow talk, and as relayed to readers by Atwood\u2019s third-person narrator\u2014stands in counterpoint to Toby\u2019s rendering of the story as myth. She picks up where the character Snowman left off in the first volume, fleshing out his story of the \u201cgood, kind Crake\u201d who created the Crakers and \u201ccleared away the chaos\u201d of the world for them. Whereas Snowman\u2019s storytelling was primarily in the service of cynical self-interest, to induce the Crakers to bring him food, Toby\u2019s motives are decidedly more altruistic.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Though she is aware of the risks of sugarcoating the story of a man bent on destroying the human race, Toby is also conscious of her moral obligation to help the Crakers develop an origin myth that will serve them for the future. Atwood\u2019s portrayal of Toby\u2019s storytelling, along with her dramatization of the Crakers\u2019 development of an oral and written tradition, thus expresses her underlying faith in what Wayne C. Booth called the ethics of fiction.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Atwood sometimes plays it too much for laughs\u2014one particularly awkward bit involves Toby\u2019s attempt to explain to the Crakers the identity of the godlike \u201cOh Fuck!\u201d that the surviving humans keep invoking. But, at its best, the mythos she limns through Toby\u2019s storytelling is both satisfying and powerful. \u201cThe Story of the Two Eggs,\u201d for example, portrays Oryx as an owl who laid two eggs, one filled with all the animals of earth, the other filled with words.&nbsp; The Children of Crake got the gift of language, Toby continues, by eating most of the second egg, but she notes that the animals, too, ate some of the words, contrary to what Crake believed would happen. Toby explains that \u201cCrake was not always right about everything,\u201d leading them to the idea of a creator who is benevolent but not infallible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=\"nonindented quote\"&gt;Together, the Crakers and the Pigoons&nbsp;signify what Atwood calls \u201custopia\u201d:&nbsp;\u201c[a] word I made up by combining utopia and dystopia&nbsp;\u2026\u201d&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The animals that ate most of the leftover words were the Pigoons, a genetically engineered species of pig inadvertently released into the wild during the chaos after the pandemic. Whereas the Crakers are essentially humans with a suite of animal add-ons (such as built-in mosquito repellent and sunblock, the ability to soothe and even heal via therapeutic purring, and baboon-like sexual display to facilitate non-pair bonded reproduction), the Pigoons lie closer to the animal end of the continuum, albeit with some notable human mix-ins. Bred to grow extra kidneys for xeno-transplantation to humans, the Pigoons are not only extra fierce and extra large but also extra smart, a side effect of the human prefrontal cortex tissue in their brains. Gifted with strong problem-solving abilities and good memories, they can hold a grudge and are dangerously omnivorous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Crakers are the product of a benighted utopian vision of a genetically engineered human future, while the Pigoons evoke H. G. Wells\u2019s techno-dystopian vision in &lt;i&gt;The Island of Dr. Moreau&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;with shades of Orwell\u2019s &lt;i&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/i&gt;. Together they signify what Atwood calls \u201custopia\u201d: \u201c[a] word I made up by combining utopia and dystopia\u2014the imagined perfect society and its opposite\u2014because, in my view, each contains a latent version of the other.\u201d{{f}} Her insight that utopia gives rise to dystopia\u2014and that dystopia also gives rise to utopia, or at least to utopian desires and projects\u2014informs her depiction of the Promethean Crake, the evangelical God\u2019s Gardeners, and the MaddAddamite underground. All are visionaries who attempt to perfect the world, or at least to resist some of its worst tendencies. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Atwood is neither anti-religion nor anti-science. She insists, rather, that practitioners of both must be subject to ethical self-reflection and social accountability, and that the making and sharing of song and story and image\u2014in other words, the arts\u2014are among our most revealing mirrors.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Crakers and the Pigoons represent the two different faces of the post-humanity that has inherited this blighted earth. They are, quite literally, brother species to humanity\u2014family members who embody both self and otherness\u2014with whom the surviving humans must learn to coexist. Tellingly, the singing of the Crakers allows them to serve as intermediaries between the humans and the Pigoons. If the \u201cdigital-keyboard theremin sounds\u201d of their \u201ceerie waterglass voices\u201d make them seem profoundly otherworldly, their singing, along with their dreaming and their symbol-making, is what makes them most recognizably human. Significantly, their singing is something they share with Zeb, though his repertoire tends more toward obscene ditties. To sing is to be human in Atwood\u2019s novel, where it is equally human to be irritated, at least sometimes, by the singing of others. Hence Toby\u2019s patient but exasperated recurrent request to the Crakers, \u201cPlease don\u2019t sing,\u201d when they repeatedly interrupt the stories they demand from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=\"nonindented quote\"&gt;Atwood cautions against a complacent acceptance of technology for technology\u2019s sake and highlights the risks of taking the bottom line as our sole guiding principle.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Atwood\u2019s trilogy insists that we balance the human desire for scientific experimentation and technological innovation with the values of community and the greater good. We can see this balance in her own embrace of the digital revolution. While &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt;, like its two predecessors, satirically targets the pornographic violence and immersive addictiveness of much of what is available online, Atwood is herself an innovator in the virtual realm. To promote &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Flood&lt;/i&gt;, she supplemented her &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://margaretatwood.ca/\" name=\"\" target=\"\"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.yearoftheflood.com/\" name=\"\" target=\"\"&gt;another site&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the book that offered&nbsp;unusual tie-ins such as sheet music and CDs&nbsp;featuring the hymns of the God\u2019s Gardeners. Atwood has, moreover, taken to Twitter like a digital native. With more than 400,000 followers, she uses this platform to promote both her own work and the political, environmental, and artistic efforts of a cohort of like-minded Tweeters. She has also experimented with brave new online platforms. She recently published a four-episode, online only, dystopian serial called &lt;i&gt;Positron&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.byliner.com/margaret-atwood\" name=\"\" target=\"\"&gt;Byliner.com&lt;/a&gt;, and she found a venue for &lt;i&gt;Happy Zombie Sunrise Home&lt;/i&gt;, written collaboratively with Naomi Alderman, on &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/story/2426517-the-happy-zombie-sunrise-home\" name=\"\" target=\"\"&gt;Wattpad.com&lt;/a&gt;. Atwood has even launched a couple of online start-ups of her own: first, Long Pen&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in 2007, a device that allows authors to sign their books remotely, then &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fanado.com/\" name=\"\" target=\"\"&gt;Fanado.com&lt;/a&gt;, its next-generation sibling, crowd-funded in 2012 but still in production. This virtual event space will allow artists and their fans to meet, talk, interact, and sign collectibles\u2014cards, T-shirts, paper books, even e-books\u2014on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of which is to say that Margaret Atwood is no Luddite. She sees the possibilities of advanced technology, and avails herself of its power with gusto. But she also cautions against a complacent acceptance of technology for technology\u2019s sake and highlights the risks of taking the bottom line as our sole guiding principle.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Her feminist and environmentalist politics offer a sharp corrective to the force of neoliberalism in an increasingly globalized world economy and a damaged world ecosystem. In the &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam &lt;/i&gt;trilogy, she dramatizes the dire stakes of a cavalier disregard for the well-being of the planet and the species that inhabit it. In telling and retelling the story of the Crakers\u2019 origins, &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt; reveals the blurriness of the lines that separate the human from the non-human, and illuminates the fine but strong thread that joins the fate of all species. This final volume of Atwood\u2019s trilogy signals the end of the end of a fictional world she has been creating for over a decade, an ending that emphasizes the possibility of post-apocalyptic revelation as much as it does our drive toward self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","created_at":"2013-10-10T18:50:45+00:00","date":"2013-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","excerpt":"Margaret Atwood\u2019s &lt;i&gt;MaddAddam&lt;/i&gt; trilogy may be one of the most significant works of 21st-century literature that you haven\u2019t read.&nbsp;This trilogy takes on nothing less than the intertwined dangers of ecological and social collapse, envisioning the horrifying near-future, post-apocalyptic consequences of unchecked corporate culture and scientific experimentation.","footnotes":"According to David Langford\u2019s column &lt;a href=\"http://www.ansible.co.uk/sfx/sfx107.html\"&gt; \u201cBits and Pieces\u201d&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;SFX&lt;/i&gt;, no. 107 (August 2003), Atwood made her remark about \u201ctalking squids in outer space\u201d on BBC1 Breakfast News.\r\nRobert Potts, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/26/fiction.margaretatwood\"&gt;\u201cLight in the Wilderness,\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, April 26, 2003.\r\nMargaret Atwood, &lt;i&gt;In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination&lt;/i&gt; (Nan A.

Like\nthat journal, &lt;i&gt;Public&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Books&lt;/i&gt; supports an international\ncommunity of emerging and established intellectuals and artists committed to\nvigorous debate about works and ideas that deserve timely, intensive discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model contributors: scholars who write\naccessibly without sacrificing sophistication or depth; artists energized by\nresearch; and activists engaged with serious ideas. Our ideal readers: the brainy,\nbookish, or insatiably curious, who share our passion for connecting to the\nworld through ideas. Our goal: to make reading &lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt; feel like sitting in on a great seminar, or being at a\nparty where people are talking about books they have actually read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why call a review &lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt; when new publics and platforms are changing how we\nread and revolutionizing the book form? Even as many bemoan its decline, the\nbook is gaining new life as a symbol both for deep engagement and for the\ninventions transforming reading into an increasingly shared, fast-paced\nexperience. The title &lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt;\nencapsulates our goal of combining the liveliness, timeliness, and communality\nof public life with the craft, reflection, and care associated with books at\ntheir best.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each month &lt;i&gt;Public\nBooks &lt;/i&gt;selects a small number of adventurous works: serious nonfiction,\nliterary fiction, memoirs, bestsellers, genre fiction, comics and graphic\nnovels, young adult and children\u2019s books. We review writers already in the\npublic eye alongside those who deserve more prominent coverage. We resuscitate\nsignificant publications that speak to the present. We feature multilingual\nreviewers who introduce us to material from all over the world, including books\nnot yet translated into English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;Because books themselves take readers beyond the\npage, our outlook is ecumenical and experimental. Recognizing that print,\naudio, and visual cultures have long intersected, we include within our purview\ne-books, audiobooks, and apps, feature films and viral videos, art exhibits and\nperformances. In addition to short and long essays, we publish interviews and\nconversations with authors and artists; field notes from ethnographers;\nsnapshots from artistic and intellectual scenes around the world; reports from\nexhibits, conferences, and book festivals; and excerpts from work published\nexclusively in &lt;i&gt;Public Culture&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Public\nBooks&lt;/i&gt; publishes online in order to take advantage of the Internet\u2019s ability\nto move instantaneously across borders, to promote interaction among readers\nand writers, and to combine word, image, and sound. Our web-based format allows\ncontributors to give new works critical attention at a quicker pace than\nscholarly publishing allows, while still allowing time for reflection. Our\nsite\u2019s cutting-edge commenting features connect reviewers to readers and\nreaders to one another. Participants are the organic core of any public sphere,\nand our online format allows the review to develop in tandem with the uses that\nits readers and authors make of it. We look forward to conversing with you on\nthe site and to shaping and reshaping &lt;i&gt;Public\nBooks &lt;/i&gt;together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","header_id":"4fbbf365c36c9000010000c4","slug":"about","subtitle":"","title":"About"},{"_id":"50c8a9df80905c0002000029","content":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I sign up for the monthly &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; newsletter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;To receive our monthly newsletter announcing new issues and upcoming events, please click on our subscribe-to-newsletter button in the top right corner of the &lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt; homepage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I contact &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"nonindented\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;General Inquiries&lt;br&gt;To contact a &lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt; staff member or contributor, please direct your email to&nbsp;info@publicbooks.org.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Submissions&lt;br&gt;Our editorial staff welcomes pitches from professional and freelance writers, journalists, scholars, and artists.

       Margaret Atwoods
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       trilogy may be one of the most significant works of 21st-century literature that you havent read. Which is surprising, since the novels have been well reviewed, avidly marketed, and abundantly sold. Yet they have been oddly absent from the radar screens of many who consider themselves aficionados of the contemporary novel.
      </p>
      <p>
       This trilogy takes on nothing less than the intertwined dangers of ecological and social collapse, envisioning the horrifying near-future, post-apocalyptic consequences of unchecked corporate culture and scientific experimentation. But Atwood masterfully realizes this big picture through the telling (and occasionally hilarious) detail, with vivid characters, gripping plots, and complex narrative structures that subtly reflect the fundamental connection between human consciousness and storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final installment,
       <i>
        MaddAddam,
       </i>
       is not the strongest of the three, but it deftly pulls together various threads left loose in
       <i>
        Oryx and Crake
       </i>
       (2003) and
       <i>
        The Year of the Flood
       </i>
       (2009). The two earlier volumes were simultanequels, a term Atwood coined to distinguish them from the linear sequencing of prequels and sequels.
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       begins where the cliffhangers of the two previous volumes ended: with the world precariously balanced between the few remaining survivors of the human race and the transhumans bioengineered to be their successors. This novel narrates the immediate destinies of the preceding volumes main characters and sketches the likely future of humanity and posthumanity. But here, as in the first two volumes of the trilogy, Atwood devotes as much time to the past as to the future.
      </p>
      <h2 class="nonindented quote">
       The novel traces the picaresque wanderings of Zeb through the varied wildernesses of the pre-apocalyptic Western hemisphere.
       <br/>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Even readers of those previous volumes may need some plot summary to orient them in this new work, which promotes a minor character from
       <i>
        The Year of the Flood
       </i>
       to the status of titular protagonist and fills in his backstory. MaddAddam is Zeb, the leader of a resistance group dedicated to battling the bioengineering corporations known as the Corps, who are policed by their own private militias, the CorpSeCorps. At least that
       <i>
        was
       </i>
       the MaddAddamites mission before they were conscripted to work for Crake, the mad scientist responsible for the viral pandemic that killed off most of the human race, as well as for the creation of their bioengineered replacementsa trusting, inquisitive, and uncannily beautiful species known as the Children of Crake or, less formally, the Crakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the previous two volumes, we only glimpsed the MaddAddamites from a distance, and this novel doesnt tell us much more about their methods or group dynamics. Rather, it tells the story of how Zeb became Zeb. His bildungsroman begins, in classic fashion, with an abusive childhood, which is mitigated only by the companionship of an older half brother, Adam. We are not surprised to learn that this Adam grows up to be
       <i>
        The Year of the Flood
       </i>
       s Adam One, the leader of a religious sect called Gods Gardeners, whose members practice vegetarianism and nonviolence and avoid using new technology. Atwood details the sadistic treatment the boys suffered at the hands of their father, who leads a fundamentalist megachurch devoted to the worship of fossil fuels, and the revenge they exact before fleeing home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The novel then traces the picaresque wanderings of Zeb through the varied wildernesses of the pre-apocalyptic Western hemisphere. He works as a pilot for Bearlift, a well-meaning but misguided save-the-bears operation high in the mountains of the Canadian Yukon andthen as a magicians assistant in Southern Californias Floating World, an urban district whosenameevokes both illicit pleasures (a reference to the floating world culture of fashion, entertainment, and prostitution in Japan's Edo period) and rising sea levels.Zeb next works as a hacker-for-hire, employed by various criminal enterprises and based in Rio de Janeiro, now known as the Wild West of the web. In this novel, as in the two previous volumes of the trilogy, Atwoods satirical portrayal of the near future is as entertaining as it is incisive in its critique of our contemporary moments volatile mix of religious fundamentalism, neoliberal profiteering, and environmental degradation.

       The fraternal relationship between Adam and ZebZeb attributes their cute A-Z name symmetry to their father, who liked to theme-park everythingis deliberately conventional. Light versus dark, methodical versus impulsive, saintly versus sinful: the formulaic polarity of
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       s brothers recalls the paired brothers (Charles and Adam, Cal and Aron) in Steinbecks generational chronicle
       <i>
        East of Eden,
       </i>
       and, like Steinbeck, Atwood allegoricallyor perhaps just flat-footedlyinvokes that originary pair of belligerent brothers, Cain and Abel.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Adam and Zeb also echo the male antagonists of
       <i>
        Oryx and Crake
       </i>
       , similarly yoked by loyalty, manipulation, and betrayal. Their agonistic bond, however, is much less compelling than the one at the heart of that earlier volume. Despite Atwoods attempts to invest Zeb with internal complexity in the form of passion and doubts, he remains a kind of action figure, an adventure romance hero largely defined by feats of derring-do at the computer keyboard, in mortal combat with man and beast, and in the sack. His physical prowess and survivalist skills come in especially handy at the novels climax, which features an epic battle between Zebs band of survivors and a violent remnant of the old human societythe two Painballers who were captured at the end of
       <i>
        The Year of the Flood

      <h2 class="nonindented quote">
       Theres the story, then theres the real story, then theres the story of how the story came to be told.
       <br/>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Although Zebs character remains fairly two-dimensional, the way that Atwood alternates between the pre-apocalyptic past and the post-apocalyptic present puts a far more interesting frame around Zebs ultimately superficial tale.
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       filters the story of Zebs past through two post-apocalyptic viewpoints: that of Toby, a former Gods Gardener who joins forces with the few other human survivors of the pandemic, and that of the Crakers, the gentle tribe of transhuman hybrids who avidly weave Zebs personal history, as retold by Toby, into a creation myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       s narrative is thus split between Zebs story as he relays it to Toby, who becomes his lover, and the version of that story that Toby tells the Crakers, who insist that she become their bard and protector-in-chief. Theres the story, then theres the real story, then theres the story of how the story came to be told. Then theres what you leave out of the story. Which is part of the story too. That is how Atwoods third-person narrator reflects upon the difference between what Toby hears from Zeb and what she sees fit to tell the Crakers, whose childlike curiosity outstrips their understanding of abstract concepts such as evil, or even such fundamental notions as human aggression or private property. This meta-reflection on the limits of narrative representation and the vicissitudes of its transmission joins
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       to the two novels that precede it in the trilogy and to Atwoods novelistic oeuvre as a whole.

       Although Atwoods metafictional bent allies her with postmodern heavy hitters such as Philip Roth and Thomas Pynchon, she has more often been considered in the company of writers such as Doris Lessing and Ursula LeGuin who have used the conventions of fantasy to explore the gendered norms and sexual desires that shape womens lives. From her earliest, more realistic work, beginning with
       <i>
        The Edible Woman
       </i>
       in the late 1960s and
       <i>
        Surfacing
       </i>
       in the early 70s, Atwoods fiction has highlighted the challenges of telling stories of identity and connection in a world of unequal power relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       While these tensions inflect her entire oeuvremore than 50 volumes of fiction, poetry, and essaysthey are most vividly dramatized in
       <i>
        The Handmaids Tale
       </i>
       (1985). This dystopian speculative novel is narrated by a reproductive surrogate slave who describes her subjection and resistance to a fundamentalist authoritarian regime, a future era that is a throwback to a nightmarish Puritan past. The fictional world of this handmaid, replete with her flashbacks to a pre-apocalyptic time before, forms a significant precursor to the post-apocalyptic world of Atwoods 21st-century trilogy.
       <i>
        The Handmaids Tale
       </i>
       has been adapted for stage, opera, and radio, and film, including a 1990 Hollywood movie that was disappointing despite a stellar cast and a screenplay by Harold Pinter. The most brilliant, best-selling, and canonical of Atwoods 14 novels, there have been repeated attempts to ban

       Atwood was nominated for the Booker Prize for
       <i>
        Handmaid
       </i>
       , and again for each of the three novels she published after that, but she did not win this honor until
       <i>
        The Blind Assassin
       </i>
       in 2000. Set in 1930s and 40s Canada,
       <i>
        The Blind Assassin
       </i>
       might well be categorized as historical fiction, though this label does not adequately account for its nested, multi-generic structure. Its framing family saga contains a love story, which, in turn, contains a science fiction story that culminates in an attack on the planet Zycron by the Lizard Men of Xenor. The pulpy tale embedded at the heart of the novel is precisely the sort of sci-ficomplete with talking squids in outer spacethat Atwood infamously distinguished from her own brand of speculative fiction.
       <a class="footnoteMarker">
       </a>
       Her brand, she claimed, extrapolates from actually existing conditions into the near future. According to Atwood, Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.
       <a class="footnoteMarker">
       </a>
       Her dismissal of SF roused the resentment (still simmering) of that genres fans, but Atwood ultimately downplayed the contretemps as a mere matter of nomenclature: In short, what Le Guin means by science fiction is what I mean by speculative fiction, and what she means by fantasy would include some of what I mean by science fiction. So that clears it all up, more or less.
       <a class="footnoteMarker">
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Though diehard SF fans have not been mollified by her efforts at rapprochement, it is worth noting that the real crisis in
       <i>
        The Blind Assassin
       </i>
       does not hinge on pinpointing the genre to which the intergalactic story belongs, but on the identity of the sister who authored the love story nested within the novel and, hence, on the question of which sister actually had the illicit love affair that the tale describes. The framing of the story draws together the narrative and the criminal senses of what it means to frame or be framed. In this regard,
       <i>
        The Blind Assassin
       </i>
       resembles Atwoods other work of historical fiction,
       <i>
        Alias Grace
       </i>
       (1996), which is presented from the complex and ultimately irreconcilable viewpoints of a convicted murderess and that of the alienist doctor who researches her case. Theres the story, then theres the real story, then theres the story of how the story came to be told. Then theres what you leave out of the story. Which is part of the story too.

       The narrative framing of
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       is what gives this novel, like Atwoods other novels, its vitality. The satirical realism of Zebs life storyas told to Toby in the form of postcoital pillow talk, and as relayed to readers by Atwoods third-person narratorstands in counterpoint to Tobys rendering of the story as myth. She picks up where the character Snowman left off in the first volume, fleshing out his story of the good, kind Crake who created the Crakers and cleared away the chaos of the world for them. Whereas Snowmans storytelling was primarily in the service of cynical self-interest, to induce the Crakers to bring him food, Tobys motives are decidedly more altruistic.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Though she is aware of the risks of sugarcoating the story of a man bent on destroying the human race, Toby is also conscious of her moral obligation to help the Crakers develop an origin myth that will serve them for the future. Atwoods portrayal of Tobys storytelling, along with her dramatization of the Crakers development of an oral and written tradition, thus expresses her underlying faith in what Wayne C. Booth called the ethics of fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atwood sometimes plays it too much for laughsone particularly awkward bit involves Tobys attempt to explain to the Crakers the identity of the godlike Oh Fuck! that the surviving humans keep invoking. But, at its best, the mythos she limns through Tobys storytelling is both satisfying and powerful. The Story of the Two Eggs, for example, portrays Oryx as an owl who laid two eggs, one filled with all the animals of earth, the other filled with words. The Children of Crake got the gift of language, Toby continues, by eating most of the second egg, but she notes that the animals, too, ate some of the words, contrary to what Crake believed would happen. Toby explains that Crake was not always right about everything, leading them to the idea of a creator who is benevolent but not infallible.

       Together, the Crakers and the Pigoonssignify what Atwood calls ustopia:[a] word I made up by combining utopia and dystopia
      </h2>
      <p>
       The animals that ate most of the leftover words were the Pigoons, a genetically engineered species of pig inadvertently released into the wild during the chaos after the pandemic. Whereas the Crakers are essentially humans with a suite of animal add-ons (such as built-in mosquito repellent and sunblock, the ability to soothe and even heal via therapeutic purring, and baboon-like sexual display to facilitate non-pair bonded reproduction), the Pigoons lie closer to the animal end of the continuum, albeit with some notable human mix-ins. Bred to grow extra kidneys for xeno-transplantation to humans, the Pigoons are not only extra fierce and extra large but also extra smart, a side effect of the human prefrontal cortex tissue in their brains. Gifted with strong problem-solving abilities and good memories, they can hold a grudge and are dangerously omnivorous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Crakers are the product of a benighted utopian vision of a genetically engineered human future, while the Pigoons evoke H. G. Wellss techno-dystopian vision in
       <i>
        The Island of Dr. Moreau

       <i>
        ,
       </i>
       with shades of Orwells
       <i>
        Animal Farm
       </i>
       . Together they signify what Atwood calls ustopia: [a] word I made up by combining utopia and dystopiathe imagined perfect society and its oppositebecause, in my view, each contains a latent version of the other.
       <a class="footnoteMarker">
       </a>
       Her insight that utopia gives rise to dystopiaand that dystopia also gives rise to utopia, or at least to utopian desires and projectsinforms her depiction of the Promethean Crake, the evangelical Gods Gardeners, and the MaddAddamite underground. All are visionaries who attempt to perfect the world, or at least to resist some of its worst tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atwood is neither anti-religion nor anti-science. She insists, rather, that practitioners of both must be subject to ethical self-reflection and social accountability, and that the making and sharing of song and story and imagein other words, the artsare among our most revealing mirrors.
      </p>

       The Crakers and the Pigoons represent the two different faces of the post-humanity that has inherited this blighted earth. They are, quite literally, brother species to humanityfamily members who embody both self and othernesswith whom the surviving humans must learn to coexist. Tellingly, the singing of the Crakers allows them to serve as intermediaries between the humans and the Pigoons. If the digital-keyboard theremin sounds of their eerie waterglass voices make them seem profoundly otherworldly, their singing, along with their dreaming and their symbol-making, is what makes them most recognizably human. Significantly, their singing is something they share with Zeb, though his repertoire tends more toward obscene ditties. To sing is to be human in Atwoods novel, where it is equally human to be irritated, at least sometimes, by the singing of others. Hence Tobys patient but exasperated recurrent request to the Crakers, Please dont sing, when they repeatedly interrupt the stories they demand from her.

       Atwoods trilogy insists that we balance the human desire for scientific experimentation and technological innovation with the values of community and the greater good. We can see this balance in her own embrace of the digital revolution. While

       <i>

       , she supplemented her

       dedicated to the book that offeredunusual tie-ins such as sheet music and CDsfeaturing the hymns of the Gods Gardeners. Atwood has, moreover, taken to Twitter like a digital native. With more than 400,000 followers, she uses this platform to promote both her own work and the political, environmental, and artistic efforts of a cohort of like-minded Tweeters. She has also experimented with brave new online platforms. She recently published a four-episode, online only, dystopian serial called

       . Atwood has even launched a couple of online start-ups of her own: first, Long Pen

       All of which is to say that Margaret Atwood is no Luddite. She sees the possibilities of advanced technology, and avails herself of its power with gusto. But she also cautions against a complacent acceptance of technology for technologys sake and highlights the risks of taking the bottom line as our sole guiding principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her feminist and environmentalist politics offer a sharp corrective to the force of neoliberalism in an increasingly globalized world economy and a damaged world ecosystem. In the
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       trilogy, she dramatizes the dire stakes of a cavalier disregard for the well-being of the planet and the species that inhabit it. In telling and retelling the story of the Crakers origins,
       <i>
        MaddAddam
       </i>
       reveals the blurriness of the lines that separate the human from the non-human, and illuminates the fine but strong thread that joins the fate of all species. This final volume of Atwoods trilogy signals the end of the end of a fictional world she has been creating for over a decade, an ending that emphasizes the possibility of post-apocalyptic revelation as much as it does our drive toward self-destruction.
