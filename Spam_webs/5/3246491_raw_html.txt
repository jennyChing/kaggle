           Bullied, bruised, and beaten, they were young outcasts.
          </strong>
          Together, they became unlikely heroes. Little Heroes is a story for anyone who has struggled to fit in and all of us who think no one is beyond redemption. You will laugh, cry, and feel righteous anger, but most of all, you will believe in hope.

          Years ago, many novels used to be released via magazines in serial form. As late as 1984 Tom Wolfes
          <i>
           Bonfire of the Vanities
          </i>
          was released by Rolling Stone over 27 parts. After this serialization, Wolfe revised the work and re-released as a stand alone novel.

          I have a novel that has sat on my hard drive for over a decade. Its an unusual, uncomfortable at times, but incredibly hopeful story about two poor boys growing up in a small town in Alabama. One is white from an abusive poor home, one is black from an even poorer home. They become unlikely friends and together overcome incredibly difficult circumstances to become Little Heroes. Im gonna release my rough draft here on the website in serial form, and then later this year re-release as a stand alone novel. Ill try to put up a new part every Wednesday. Think Steven Kings

          Skelly, Alabama
         </span>
         <br/>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Sometime Not Long Ago
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Nestled among the tall pine trees of southern Alabama breathes Skelly, a sleepy town with three churches, four service stations and six stoplights. Until the late 1960s a relatively stable community, the Eisenhower expressway from Mobile to Montgomery steered clear of Skelly and the town began to dwindle along with the passing traffic. At the height of its prosperity Skelly had numbered over 15,000, but today it was a little less than 4,000.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          While driving through Skelly on the old Mobile Highway was usually just another unmemorable experience, one of Skellys four service stations was still full-service so the occasional business traveler would stop for a fill-up. The nostalgia of full-service and the glass-bottled six-ounce Coca-Colas from the stations 1950s era icebox looked good from a rental car.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          And more often than not, the same business traveler as he sped out of town would be startled to see the local sheriff, Tom Campbell- an inflated oak of a man, holding the trigger of a radar gun. A lineman in his youth for Alabama University, his 6 4 frame had bloated considerably in the thirty years since. He weighed well over 300 pounds and looked even sloppier. Sheriff Campbell spent most afternoons sitting under a row of Ponderosa pine trees on the edge of town eating cold chicken pot pies washed down with stale Dr. Peppers, a few quick bites was all it took for his shirt to become soaked with chicken grease. This disheveled appearance left him reluctant to pull someone over, even a slob does not like being seen draped with chicken grease; and, if by chance he did stop a passing motorist, he would offer the offender a chance to pay cash in return for a ripped up ticket.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Skellys crown jewel was its courthouse. The center of Skelly and the surrounding Jefferson County for almost 150 years, its three floors of weathered red brick had survived the Civil War and stood ever since to send generations of young men off to battle for God and Country. From its cracked concrete steps, young warriors swore oaths of allegiance while family and friends stood nearby on the courthouse lawn. There were always a few grade school kids watching intently, wishing they were older, as they sat on the barrel of the towns canon that had fired at the Civil War Battle of Shiloh.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          If Is a goin, Id kill me a mess of them krauts! The boys would boast, grandly announcing how many German, Japanese or whomever we happened to be fighting at the moment they would kill.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          And off to war they did go. Many never returned, and those that did quickly settled into the obscurity of Skelly; everyone that is except for one young man, Horace Aberknocker. From World War One onward his name was legend; there was not a boy in Skelly that had not memorized Horaces exploits.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Horace had returned from Germany to be awarded the Medal of Honor on the courthouse steps by none other than General Black Jack Pershing. All of Skelly had crowded the streets in front of the courthouse as General Pershing recounted Horaces single-handed capture of an entire company of German soldiers, just like the fabled Sgt. York. Of course, that was the official story; only Horace and the soldiers that surrendered to him knew the truth.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          It was February 15, 1918, near the end of what had been a long, hard war. Morale in the German Army was low, food was scarce, and everyone from private to general was hoping for a timely armistice. On the other side of the trench, while the Europeans were as worn out as the Germans, most American soldiers were intoxicated with the euphoria of imminent victory, and their pride in turning the tide of the war in the Allies favor. Especially those of Horace Aberknockers unit who were fresh off of a transport ship and had seen little combat. Horace, in fact, was one of the few Americans who was not enthusiastic at the moment.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Horace was a malingerer, a malcontent and generally lazy soldier who had been found asleep on guard duty twice and subsequently put on permanent kitchen detail. But peeling potatoes and washing dishes was not Horaces idea of fun so true to his nature, he wandered off one night with nothing more than a machine pistol, and a little beef jerky he had been sent from home. He figured that he would find a cozy place in the woods, sleep for a few hours then return to the peeling and washing
          <i>
           . The pots, pans and puhtaters wont be goin nowhere
          </i>
          , he thought.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Horaces plan might have worked except that he was incredibly absent minded and this combined with limited intelligence soon led him unwittingly into the no-mans land between his unit and the nearby German lines. He should not have been able to make it this far but the American sentry, one of Horaces more moribund companions, had fallen asleep and Horace was able to wander merrily by the guard post.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Little did Horace know that at that same time a large company size German patrol was headed in his direction. Bumbling along with his head down, he was startled by a shout as he met the lead elements of the patrol.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Halt! A young German corporal commanded. The order was followed by scattered gunshots from the rest of the trigger-happy German patrol.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Instantly, Horace turned to run but as he did, his foot struck a tree root and he tripped. Falling in the darkness, he threw his hands forward to break the fall; when fatefully, the machine pistol he was carrying flew out of his hands and hit the ground butt first, discharging the entire 30-round magazine into the air. Luckily for Horace, the Germans were more tired of the war than he was. Scared senseless, they assumed that they had carelessly stumbled upon the American front lines. Without a thought this motley group of warriors, a sad conglomeration of children and men old enough to be their grandfathers, threw down their guns and surrendered. By the time Horace had gained enough courage to look up from where he was lying on the ground, a long line of German soldiers was walking towards him with hands held high and white flags of surrender flapping in the breeze.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Ten minutes later, this gaggle of the Reichs finest was led by a dazed and confused Horace into camp, and before Horace could report otherwise, his CO, Captain Willard Jones, was pronouncing him a hero. Willard wanted badly to have a decorated soldier rise from his unit so the legend of Horaces feat stuck. A few months later Horace returned home to be decorated and the legend of Horace Aberknocker of Aberknocker Valley, the Skelly native who had single-handedly captured an entire company of Germans in the last desperate days of the war, was immortalized forever.

        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Luke Easterly, seven and bursting with energy beneath long blond curly hair, was playing with a pile of Lincoln Logs on his living room floor. Big boned and broad-shouldered with thin hips, you could already tell that Luke would grow to be tall, slender and wiry strong. Gifted with this body and a childs innocence, Lukes world was a playground. Nowhere he tread brought fear; Luke Easterly was all boy, all the time. But today was a special wide-eyed wonderland; it was Lukes Birthday.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Luke had been playing for almost an hour when his father Jeremiah arrived home; it was clear from where Luke had inherited his physique. Jeremiah stood well over six-feet tall and weighed a rock hard 200 pounds. His hair had grown sandy blond with age and hung disheveled off his shoulders.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Jeremiah entered quickly and with heavy footsteps slammed the front door shut, passed by the living room without saying a word to Luke, and headed for the refrigerator where he quickly grabbed and opened a bottle of Budweiser. After a few swigs, he looked nervously around the kitchen and then headed out the kitchen door towards the back yard where he sat down at the familys old red picnic table to finish his beer.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Jeremiah, is at you! Sue, Jeremiahs wife and Lukes mother, called from the basement. Sue was also tall, almost five-foot ten and still fit like the swimmer she had been in High School. Her hair was as blond as Lukes, her skin as clear as spring water. Sue had been washing clothes when Jeremiah arrived home and she had taken for granted that he would greet her from the top of the basement steps with his usual, Hey hun, whats up?
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          After a few minutes without hearing a hello, she called out, Jeremiah, ya home hun? but there was no answer.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Sue finished unloading the dryer and then headed up the stairs. Luke meanwhile, was still on the living room carpet blissfully playing with his Lincoln logs. He had just finished building a rectangular structure about ten logs high. Built to resemble a fort, it looked more like a pile of what it was, logs; but it did not really matter to Luke, he had built the fort for one reason, destruction. With a devilish grin, he swung hard, slapped the logs across the room and fell on his back laughing, well satisfied with the wooden pieces sprawled across the carpet.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Outside, Jeremiah was doing some swinging of his own, but his fists were slamming the top of the picnic table and the only thing he sent flying were shivers up his arms. Occasionally, he would mumble, Whatll we do? What the hell we gonna do?
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Jeremiah had been laid off earlier that day from the paper mill. For the last five years he had worked in the mills machine shop and the $21 an hour job along with plenty of overtime had allowed the family to buy a home, a nice car, and most other illusions of middle class comfort. In reality, they had only been able to qualify for plastic credit and loans that left them deeper and deeper in debt.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Jeremiah had been hearing layoff rumors for almost a year. The mill was losing money and more than once payday had been delayed; still, he ignored the warning signs. Fear goaded him into believing the fantasy that life would take care of itself, so he resigned himself to a simple mantra of, what happens, happens, lifes just fate. Fatefully for the family, he did nothing but take for granted that the bills would be paid and life would remain predictable.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          But life is never predictable, and now Jeremiah could not ignore the car and house payments that would break the family. He also knew there were no other jobs in town that could meet their needs. Jeremiah and Sue had thought about moving before, but moving seemed like such a fantasy they could not really consider it. All they knew was Skelly. Worse still, even if they had wanted to, they could not afford to move much further than the county line. With practically no money in savings and their credit cards completely extended, save one with an available credit of less than a couple hundred dollars, Jeremiahs best answer at the moment was to keep hitting the table.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Jeremiah, whats wrong hun? Sue walked out of the kitchen toward Jeremiah. Jeremiah, hearing Sues voice, broke down in tears, then quickly tried to compose himself and straighten up, wiping his eyes scratchy red.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Sue headed around the picnic table and asked again, Whats wrong hun, ya didnt say a word when ya got home?
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          The mill, Jeremiah whispered, turning neither his head nor eyes in her direction, staring helplessly into a sunset that was fading into night.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          The mill, whats wrong at the mill? Sue moved closer, sitting down then sliding her arms around Jeremiahs waist. Jeremiah began to rock back and forth like a baby, but the blank look of a beaten man remained. Sue tried to speak but Jeremiahs sullen words interrupted her.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Im done. Were all done Sue. Jeremiahs knuckles turned white as he clenched the picnic-table top. They went and did it. They finally did it.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Did what Jeremiah? Whatd they do baby? Sues voice softened.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Laid us off. Give us a severance check and said we might git called back in a few months. Bunch o crap. Jeremiah hit the table. Theyll never call. Millll be closed by the end o the year.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Let em have their mill. Sue leaned toward Jeremiah and held him tighter. Well find a way, always do.

         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">

          Well find a way, dont fret bout it. Sue then abruptly switched gears remembering Luke,  Did ya forget about Luke? Hes been waiting all day to see you. You didnt forget its his birthday?
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Those bastards. I cant believe it. Even a fathers love couldnt break through Jeremiahs despair.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Oh Jeremiah, Sue sighed as Jeremiah continued lamenting, burying his head deep in the comfort of Sues breasts. For the next thirty minutes he continued to weep and explain what had happened at the mill.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Sue was unfazed. After the initial shock of Jeremiahs news, she was comforted with blind hope and met Jeremiahs fears with convicted pronouncements that they would find a way to make it. She assumed that if they had to, she would get a second job and they would save until they could leave Skelly and find good work in Montague or Birmingham.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          By the time Sue had finished her consoling, Jeremiah, while still frightened, knew they would find a way to make it out of Skelly. Sues love gave him the strength to be the man he could only see glimpses of by himself, glimpses that he usually mistook for vain imagination.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          My God, its Lukes birthday, cmon Jeremiah. Sue stood up and grabbed Jeremiah, remembering Luke again. Thank God hes playin Lincoln Logs. That boyd lose himself playin with toothpicks.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Most kids would have followed their dad out the door into the yard and begged themselves rotten for their birthday present, but Luke was having too much fun, presents could wait. Sue could not, she had waited long enough, family crisis or not. It was time to celebrate a birthday.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          What bout Luke Jeremiah, did ya say happy birthday? Sue queried as they walked inside. And what bout the puppy you were goin to bring home?
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Didnt say much to em when I got in. I dont know how to face em. Puppys in the car though, Jeremiah shrugged.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Puppys been in the car! Sues hands dropped to her hips, Jeremiah, get that dog right now.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Ahright, ahright, Jeremiah shrugged and looked away, dogs fine Sue.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Almost an hour after walking out to him, Sue followed Jeremiah into the living room where he greeted Luke with a dispirited, happy birthday squirt.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Dad, dad, whatta bout my present? Luke was tired of the Lincoln Logs and he hadnt forgotten that it was his birthday and birthdays mean presents.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Dont know bout any present, Jeremiah teased, but lets see what I got in the truck.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Dad, ya did get me somethin. Dad! Luke screamed with joy.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Smiling, Jeremiah rushed out to his truck. He was a simple man, more often than not a slave to his passions; but love can tame the wildest beast if given a chance. With Sues steady help, he was able to accept and return as best he could the vulnerable love of a child. But it was terribly hard for Jeremiah, he was brought up to hide his tears and dryly suck up any emotions. This coolness along with the frustrated mediocrity of an aging man was a volatile mix for a father; but Sue did her best and Jeremiah did not do his worst.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Out in the truck Jeremiah grabbed a black ball of fur. Lukes present was an eight-week old mutt that looked like a small Border Collie. All black with a white streak down its forehead and over its left eye, it was a dynamo of energy, the perfect companion for Luke.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Ha, ha, ha! Luke laughed, knocking over another hastily built fort, as Jeremiah entered with the dog.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Dad, a pup. Mom look a puppy! Luke pointed and ran.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Its wonderful Luke, just wonderful. Sue stood back and smiled from the kitchen doorway.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Whatchya gonna name it? Jeremiah asked Luke.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Dont know, watchya think. Luke looked up at Jeremiah with wide eyes and the puppy flopping around in his arms.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Guess ya ought ta pick the first cool name you think of.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Cody, Luke hugged his furry new companion, I like Cody.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Then Cody it is, Jeremiah agreed.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Luke and the newly christened Cody rolled around on the floor while Jeremiah and Sue embraced, the days crisis lingering in the shadows long enough to allow a moment of peace.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Full of confidence and hope, Jeremiah smiled, then stooped over and scooped Luke up in his arms. Kissing him on the cheek, he was sure now, Well find a way.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Sue smiled back then continued on to the kitchen. She wanted Jeremiah and Luke to have a little time alone. At least that is what she told herself. She was exhausted and had been for the last couple of months. While bearable at first, lately, she had been feeling sick and painfully tired. By the time Luke got his present she was hanging onto Jeremiah. Merely standing, watching Luke and the puppy caused sweat to form on her brow. She felt flush and faint; but none of it was enough to wipe the smile off her face. The love of this mother was a dying one. She would sacrifice life itself for Luke.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Jeremiah had badgered her to see a doctor, but she always had too little time and too many excuses.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          Itll get better. It has to, Sue assured herself.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font: 13.0px Arial;">
          But it would not get better. Now that he had been laid off, Jeremiah would lose his health insurance in three months. Without his mill job, money would be tight and the cost of a Doctors visit overwhelming. And as the pain grew, Sue would lose the conviction that she and Jeremiah seemed to have found. Her only hope would become a faint wish, Ill feel better soon. I have to. I cant leave Luke.
