         If 
		you burn the candle at both ends horizontally at 75 1/2 Bedford St., you 
		just might set the opposing walls on fire. At 9 1/2 ft. wide, 75 1/2 
		Bedford St., off Seventh Ave. between Commerce and Moore Sts., is the 
		narrowest house in the city. On the inside, it measures 8 ft. 7 in. 
		wide; at its narrowest, its 2 ft. wide. From the facade to the rear 
		garden the house is a cozy 30 ft. deep. Yet this svelte picturesque 
		three-story red-brick structure casts a wide history as the cherished 
		residence of regular folk as well as the renowned and the scandalous, 
		most notably Edna St. Vincent Millay, who penned the famous candle quote 
		 but alas, not while living here: (My candles burning at both ends/It 
		will not last the night./But Oh my foes, and Ah my friends/It sheds a 
		lovely light.)

         The archives of the Greenwich Village 
		Society for Historic Preservation state that the house was constructed 
		in 1873 during a smallpox epidemic, for Horatio Gomez, trustee of the 
		Hettie Hendricks-Gomez Estate, on what was the former carriage 
		entranceway (with stables to the rear) between numbers 75 and 77. 
		However, according to an article by Christopher Gray in the New York 
		Times, dated Nov. 10, 1996, The assessed value of the entire parcel did 
		not change, suggesting that the house had been built before then but 
		simply not noted.

         In its early years, 75 1/2 Bedford was used 
		as a cobblers shop and then a candy factory (in 1880, Martha Banta, a 
		candy maker, lived there). Thomas Newett, a shipper, lived there in the 
		1890s. By 1920, the neighborhood had become largely working-class 
		Italian, and Victor Ponchione, a recent immigrant and a cooper in a 
		vineyard, his wife and two children resided in the building. Then in 
		1923, when Greenwich Village was just beginning to reinvent itself as an 
		artists enclave, Spalding Hall and fellow artists and actors leased 
		73-77 Bedford St. from Hendricks-Gomezs descendants. The group 
		established the Cherry Lane Theater around the corner at 38 Commerce St. 
		and converted the three contiguous buildings into apartments in order to 
		rent them out. Shortly thereafter the openly bisexual Millay, Vincent, 
		as she was known by her friends, and her new husband, Eugen Jan 
		Boissevain, a coffee importer, took up residence at 75 1/2 Bedford. They 
		hired Ferdinand Savignano to renovate the house. He put in a skylight 
		and transformed the top floor into a studio for Millay, installed 
		casement windows at each level and topped the front with a tiny Dutch 
		stepped gable, most likely to reflect Boissevains Dutch heritage. 
		Before that, reports Gray, the house had a typical Italianate look 
		common to the 1850s, as depicted in a 1922 photograph at the New-York 
		Historical Society.

         According to the plaque on the front of the 
		building, Edna St. Vincent Millay lived there from 1923-1924 and wrote 
		The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver, for which she won the Pulitzer Prize. 
		Not so, says Elizabeth Barnett, literary executor of the Millay Society. 
		Via e-mail, Barnett stated that Millay did not write this poem there. 
		Millay worked on that poem while living in Europe and finished it 
		before returning to the U.S.A. Millay and her husband lived at 
		Steepletop, Austerlitz, NY, beginning in 1925. She lived there until her 
		death in 1950, her husband until his death in 1949. However, writer Ann 
		McGovern (who lived at the building sometime in the late 1980s) asserted 
		in a newspaper interview that Millay wrote part of The Kings Henchmen 
		there.

         In the 1930s, the cartoonist William Steig, 
		his wife and her sister, anthropologist Margaret Mead, lived in the 
		house. According to an Italian guidebook that an Italian tourist had 
		with him in front of the house recently, actors John Barrymore and Cary 
		Grant also had a brief run in the place. In 1952, the entire corner was 
		slated for redevelopment when Kenneth Carroad, a lawyer and Village 
		resident, purchased the house to preserve it. His family lived here for 
		many years. In 1982, Jeffrey Carroad, a family member, put the house up 
		for sale for $350,000. Cedric Wilson and Christopher Dubs, an architect, 
		purchased it in 1996 for a reported $270,000 and spent another $200,000 
		on renovations. It was in dire need of repair. It was a mess. I was 
		afraid to use the stairs inside, said Monique, who lives next door at 
		77 Bedford St. in the landmarked 1799 Isaacs-Hendricks House, who 
		requested her last name not be used.

         The couple that currently resides in the 
		building  and wishes to remain anonymous  agree the renovation the 
		previous owners did was badly needed. They redid everything  exposed 
		and oiled the wooden beams on all the ceilings, redid the floors, 
		staircase, wooden railing, put down gray carpeting throughout the house, 
		put in air conditioners in every room. They made lifestyle improvements. 
		They took it from being a house that a bunch of students would rent to 
		being a nice family home, said Laura, a petite, 5 ft. 2 in., 
		23-year-old banker with dark hair, dark eyes, dark-rimmed glasses and a 
		pleasantly wry sense of humor.

         She and David, her 6-ft.-tall, 
		24-year-old boyfriend, a professional musician with a shaved head, have 
		lived here on a regular basis since summer 2002. The young womans 
		father, a generic businessman, Laura said, bought the house completely 
		furnished in November 2000 from Wilson and Dubs when he was transferred 
		from Chicago. He used it as his bachelor pad during the week. When he 
		retired in 2001, he didnt want to sell or rent the house to strangers 
		because he had become so attached it.

         A centrally placed spiral staircase 
		dominates all three floors and bisects the space into two distinct 
		living areas. The narrow steps call for expert sideways navigational 
		skills. Under the stairwell on the first floor is a tiny utility closet, 
		the only closed storage space in the house. All three floors have 
		fireplaces. An overloaded metal coat rack is next to the two-seater sofa 
		in the front parlor. We used to have all our coats on three hooks near 
		the front entrance, but one by one they just fell out of the wall, said 
		Laura.

       <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         In the rear kitchen, there is a wooden 
		counter with a compact sink, some stools, four mini burners lined up 
		flush against a wall, a refrigerator and cupboards. The kitchen enjoys 
		abundant natural sunlight that radiates through a wall of windows. A 
		Dutch door gives access to a leafy garden. To the right is an arched 
		black iron gate, which exits onto Commerce St. Technically, each of the 
		three neighbors has a portion of the garden, which is the width of the 
		back of the houses, but if we want to have a party or company over, we 
		have an agreement that we can use all of it, said Laura.

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         Both the second- and third-floor rear rooms 
		(office and bedroom, respectively) feature glass and wooden doors that 
		open wide onto a sturdy U-shaped iron balcony that overlooks the garden. 
		The third-floor front constitutes the storage area: one wall of shelves 
		and a hanging bar along another wall, because you wouldnt want to 
		close off half of the space, explained Laura.

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         In the kitchen a heavy trapdoor is propped 
		open to reveal a steep staircase that leads down to the basement 
		boiler/laundry room at the back and Davids recording studio and a small 
		bed at the front. There is also a door that leads to a trapdoor that 
		exits to the outside. Once a month I let the meter man in this way, and 
		thats about all the action it sees, said Laura.

       <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         A dollhouse-sized kitchenette and a 
		bathroom are nestled between the two mini spaces. You cant even wash 
		your hands in the sink. If you slide the door closed, your knees bump 
		against it. The shower head is up against the wall, so if you want to 
		wash one armpit, you turn one way, and then turn the other way to wash 
		the other, demonstrated Laura with great comic effect.

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         Laura and David plan to stay here until my 
		parents kick us out, she said laughing. But its certainly not a house 
		you can raise a family in. Can you imagine your 3-year-old running up 
		and down those stairs? You couldnt leave the trapdoor to the basement 
		open like we do now. It wouldnt be a safe house.

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         Living in this historic fishbowl, Laura and 
		David are besieged by a steady stream of curiosity seekers and tourists 
		of all nations. When their green-eyed female cat, James (real name), 
		perches on the front windowsill and pushes aside the perpetually drawn 
		bottom window shade, outsiders peek inside. When my parents first moved 
		in, they thought it was hilarious, related Laura. At one point, my mom 
		let in a tour of about 40 people. Then it gets tiresome. I usually walk 
		out with my head down.

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         They just dont think that this is really 
		where we live. There are people out there all the time. I can hear their 
		comments like, Someone really lives in that tiny house? I want to poke 
		my head out and say, Yes, and Im really proud of this little house.
