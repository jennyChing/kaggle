   <h2>
    The Writings of Ibn 'Arabi
   </h2>
   <p>
    Ibn 'Arabi is one of the most inventive and prolific writers of the Islamic tradition, with a very large number of books and treatise attributed to him. He wrote a number of works whilst still living in Andalusia, but the majority of his writings date from the second part of his life when he was living in Mecca, Anatolia and Damascus.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of the heritage which has come down to us, there is a core of about 85 works which we can be certain are genuine works by him. These include the encyclopaedic "Meccan Revelations" (
    <em>
     al-Futt al-Makkiyya
    </em>
    ) which numbers more than 2,000 pages in the printed edition, and around 15 substantial long works, including a
    <em>
     Dwn
    </em>
    (collected poetry) of about 800 poems and his master work "The Ringstones of Wisdom" (
    <em>
     Fuss al-ikam
    </em>
    ). The remainder are short treatises, some just a few pages long written in response to a students need or request.
   </p>
   <div style="width: 300px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 1px solid  #BB4725; padding: 0 10px;">
    <p>
     We do not know exactly how many works Ibn 'Arab originally wrote. There are two lists that he wrote out himself that would indicate a number of around 300, but the situation is complicated by the fact that many shorter works were eventually absorbed into the
     <em>
      Futht
     </em>
     and therefore ceased to exist as separate works. Also, in the eight centuries since his death, many works have been wrongly attributed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to achieve a clearer picture, the MIAS Archiving Project has been conducting research into the written heritage and to date has examined more than 3,000 manuscripts in libraries throughout the world.

      Establishing Ibn 'Arab's Heritage: First findings from the MIAS Archiving Project

   </p>
   <h5>
    <em>
     Fuss al-hikam
    </em>
    ("The Ringstones of Wisdom")
   </h5>
   <p>
    Considered to be the quintessence of Ibn 'Arabi's spiritual teaching, it comprises twenty-seven chapters, each dedicated to the spiritual meaning and wisdom of a particular prophet. Over the centuries Ibn 'Arabi's students held this book in the highest esteem and wrote over one hundred commentaries on it.
   </p>
   <h5>
    <em>
     Al-Futht al-makkiyya
    </em>
    ("The Meccan Openings")
   </h5>
   <p>
    "This is a vast compendium of metaphysics, cosmology, spiritual anthropology, psychology, and jurisprudence. Topics include the inner meanings of the Islamic rituals, the stations of travellers on the journey to God and in God, the nature of cosmic hierarchy, the spiritual and ontological meaning of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, the sciences embraced by each of the ninety-nine names of God, and the significance of the differing messages of various prophets." This work was written over a twenty-year period as Ibn 'Arabi travelled in the Near East, and revised in a second recension during the time he lived in Damascus.
   </p>
   <h5>
    <em>
     Tarjuman al-ashwaq
    </em>
    ("The Interpreter of Yearnings")
   </h5>
   <p>
    This short collection of love poetry was inspired by his meeting during his first pilgrimage to Mecca with Nizam, the beautiful and gifted daughter of a great scholar from Isfahan. He later wrote a long commentary on the poems to prove to one of his critics that they deal with spiritual truths and not profane love. It was the first of Ibn 'Arabi's works to be translated into English.

    </i>
    , was published by Osman Yahia in 1964. Although the

    <em>
     Fuss al-hikam
    </em>
    as the quintessence of his writings and thought and a major source of his influence is well-known,  and is attested to by the more than one hundred commentaries written upon it. Ibn 'Arabi also wrote a work called
    <em>
     Naqsh al-fuss
    </em>
    (the "Imprint" or "Pattern of the Fuss"), in which he summarized briefly the main discussions of the
    <em>

    <em>
     Naqd al-nuss fi sharh naqsh al-fuss

    , written in the year 863/1459 incorporated the text of Ibn 'Arabi's summary, and had his own commentary in a mix of Arabic and Persian. William Chittick's translation of about one-sixth of Jam's work was first published in Sophia Perennis (1975), then in the Journal of the Ibn 'Arabi Society (1982). (

    <em>

    <i>

    is not a conceptually organized text, and key themes and terms are not explained when they first appear. Instead, Ibn al-Arab seems to be speaking extemporaneously. Thus, in order to understand what Ibn al-Arab is saying in any particular instance, the translator must know (and reference for the reader) the full context, drawn from the entire text. In a sense the
    <i>
     Futt

    is an oral work, and explanations are needed to fill in the contextual gaps which a contemporary listener, in tune with Ibn al-Arab and his subject matter, would not have needed." Some introductory notes are followed by a translation of the first chapter of the

However, it is worth recalling in the case of the genies, given the misgivings which this element of Islamic cosmology can give rise to and the negative connotations which accompany it. The study of the figure of the genie or

    </i>
    in Ibn 'Arab's

within the long opening section of the Futht. Those chapters, whose arrangement follows the traditional ordering of the symbolic "events" and "places" of the Resurrection mentioned in Islamic scriptures, begin with descriptions of Gehenna and the "Fires" and other torments of its residents (chapters 61-62) and conclude with the stages of redemption and eventual bliss of  souls who have reached the Gardens of paradise (chapters 64-65).

    <em>
     mi'raj
    </em>
    ) or nocturnal voyage (isra', at Kor. 17:1) and the revelatory vision in which it culminated (Kor. 53:1-18) subsequently gave rise to a vast body of interpretations among the many later traditions of Islamic thought and spirituality. Ibn 'Arabi's personal adaptation of that material, in at least four separate longer narratives, reflects both the typical features of his distinctive approach to the Koran and hadith and the full range of his metaphysical-theological teachings and practical spiritual concerns.

[It turns out that] the [truth of the] matter is contrary to my previous position. So I cried and said to myself, perhaps that which has occurred to me is also like the first position!.
