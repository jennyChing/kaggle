             </b>
             (9:00-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC Television Network.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was the hug felt around the world. And no one will ever forget it. When stunning Britt Nilsson pulled up at the Bachelor Mansion and approached Chris, she was trembling with nervous anticipation. Moments later, she found herself in an embrace that captured both Chris and the countrys heart. Later that night, Chris confirmed the intensity of that embrace when he handed Britt the coveted first impression rose. And with that, a love affair began to blossom.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Chriss journey evolved, no onecertainly none of the other girlscould deny the connection between Britt and the handsome farmer. Their kisses were passionate, their conversations intimate. However, what seemed like true love all came to a screeching halt just before hometown dates. Britts dream of finding a husband was shattered. She left in tears, returning to her hometown in Michigan to mend her heart with her loving family by her side.
            </p>
            <p>
             Born just outside Detroit, Michigan, Britt eventually moved to Los Angeles to attend college at Azusa Pacific University. After school, she stayed in California, moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in modeling. After giving up modeling, Britt worked as a waitress, spreading her infectious personality while serving others. She also began volunteering at a local church, where you can often find her greeting congregants at the door.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since she left the show, America just cant stop talking about Britt  and she is back and determined to find the elusive, true love she has been looking for her entire life. She knows that this process worked once for her, and she cant wait to give it another go.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then there is Kaitlyn Bristowe. Millions watched in quiet astonishment when Chris explained to a heartbroken Kaitlyn that she was not the woman with whom he would be spending the rest of his life. Her eyes brimming with tears, she stepped inside a waiting car to head back to her single life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kaitlyn is truly one of a kind. Shes beautiful, irreverent, and undeniably hilarious. In the past, however, her playful demeanor has often kept her from opening up and being vulnerable to love. It was her experience on the Bachelor that helped her finally tap into that part of her heart that had been dormant for so long. Even though she went home without the love she was so desperately looking for, Kaitlyn is thankful for her time with Chris. And nowmore than evershe is ready to let down those walls and find love again.
            </p>
            <p>
             The daughter of a ballerina, Kaitlyns love of dance took hold at a very young age, and she hasnt stopped moving since, neither figuratively nor literally. Currently, she teaches spin classes. However, Kaitlyns ready to trade in the cycling shoes and the gym for a pair of sparkly high heels and a house near the Bachelor mansion. Viewers were thankful for the laughs and smiles she gave them along the way, as her electric personality and indelible sense of humor lit up the screen each week. Kaitlyn was a huge fan favorite from the beginning, and remains so to this day. She is one hundred percent certain that this is the way she is going to find her husband, and wants everyone to share this once-in-a-lifetime ride with her.

             The mothers in two celebrity families with vastly diverse values switch homes (but not bedrooms) -- embarking on a journey like no other and revealing the various ways some controversial celebrities live their lives. The two moms are given the chance to see how another celebrity raises their children and deals with life in the spotlight, while allowing both couples the opportunity to re-discover why they love each other and decided to get together in the first place. It's a mind-blowing experiment that will change their lives forever.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In each of the episodes, two mothers with very different types of households swap lifestyles and children in a week-long challenge. In the first part of the swap, each mom moves into the other's home and adopts their new celebrity family's lifestyle, no matter how different it may be. They agree to follow a manual written by the departing mother that sets out the rules of their new household - how they parent, manage their social life, do house work, unwind and more.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In the second half of the week, everything changes. The new moms take charge. They introduce their own set of rules and get to run the new household their way. It's a radical shock to both celebrity families. The results are explosive, enlightening, emotional and often very funny.

He tries to escape all the female drama at home in the warm, manly embrace of his job at the Outdoor Man store, a sporting goods emporium where he is marketing director. Also, he still revels in his Outdoor Man video blog, which he delightedly uses as a pulpit for his opinions and a voice to appeal to those who agree that manliness is under assault. When hes supposed to be selling mountain bikes or kayaks, for some reason he always ends up spouting off about the environment, Obamacare, international politics or any other topic occupying his mind.

             It's 1946 and peace has dealt Peggy a serious blow as she finds herself marginalized when the men return home from fighting abroad.

             If caught going on these secret missions for Stark, Peggy could be targeted as a traitor and spend the rest of her days in prison or worse.

             Critically lauded for revitalizing the television sitcom, "Modern Family" is also quickly cementing itself as a culturally defining series. The recipient of four consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Television Series, "Modern Family" returns to the ABC Television Network for its fifth season.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The Pritchett-Dunphy-Tucker clan is a wonderfully large and blended family with Jay Pritchett sitting at the head. By his side is his young, vivacious second wife Gloria, who resists his old-fashioned ways -- an impulse that will become all the more interesting now that he and Gloria have a new baby of their own. This exciting addition will bring more adventures to the family just as Gloria's son, Manny, is about to embark on an adventure of his own as he enters high school. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, also have their son, Luke, heading to high school; their middle daughter, Alex, is full steam ahead on the college track, and the eldest, Haley, is back home figuring out her future. With the kids all growing up, this new chapter means Claire can explore returning to the workforce, which will have its fair share of missteps and victories. And this will be a big year for Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, who alongside his loving partner, Cameron, and daughter Lily, will have a lot of reasons to celebrate. Together these three families give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted, embrace of the modern family.

             Fans of ABC's widely acclaimed real life medical series can take heart. A fresh edition of the multi award-winning
             <i>
              NY Med
             </i>
             will air this summer after nearly two years of production. Expanding their scope, the producers offer a riveting tale of two cities. Each episode in this eight-part series toggles between the renowned surgeons of Manhattan's New York Presbyterian Hospital and the gritty world of trauma surgeons at Newark's University Hospital where the ER is a doorway to the mean streets of one of America's most violent cities. Sometimes poignant and often uproarious, this limited series takes a deep dive into high stakes medicine through the eyes of unforgettable characters, including a hilarious trio of returning ER nurses who must cope with tricky personal crises while caring for some of the nation's most bossy patients. Mehmet Oz rounds out the character roster with his extraordinary surgical skills on full display as his deft hands work to fix damaged hearts and save lives.

             This is Fairy Tale Land. It's filled with magic, monsters and all of the characters we all know from stories growing up. It's real, and so are the people in it. But unlike the "happily ever after" you may have heard about, their stories continued, and The Evil Queen cast a Dark Curse over the land....
            </p>
            <p>
             This is Storybrooke. It's a quiet, little, New England town filled with people who go about their everyday lives with no idea who they really are. The Queen's Curse has trapped them here and placed her in near-complete control. They have no real memories and no real hope.

But when Henrythe son she gave up 10 years agofinds her, everything changes. Henry is desperate for his moms help and thinks that Emma is actually the long, lost daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Yes, the actual Snow White and Prince Charming.

As Henry shows Emma around with the help of his fairytale book, the town, and its inhabitants like Henrys therapist Archie Hopper and the enigmatic Mr. Gold, seem just strange enough to set off her already suspicious nature. She becomes even more concerned for Henry when she meets his adopted mother, Regina, who he suspects is none other than the Evil Queen herself!
            </p>
            <p>

After being tricked and led astray for daysand learning that he was also Rumplestiltskin's fatherPan was defeated and trapped inside Pandora's Box. Our heroes returned to Storybrooke, only to discover that Pan had switched bodies with Henry and was about to enact a curse that would have killed every living soul in town. But after discovering the switch and restoring Henry back into his body, Rumplestiltskin paid the ultimate price by sacrificing his life and killing Pan. In turn, Regina obliterated her original curse, which erased Storybrooke from existence and whisked its residents back to Fairy Tale Land, leaving Emma and Henry together back in our world with pleasant memoriesbut with no memories of Storybrooke or its residents, and with Storybrooke itself seemingly gone for good.

             After defeating Zelena the Wicked Witch of the West Emma and Hook were pulled into her time portal, which brought them back to the Enchanted Forest of the past. When they accidentally thwarted the initial meeting of Snow White and Prince Charming, Emma and Hook had to find a way to fix the timeline and get them together, or risk altering their futures and possibly obliterating Emma and Henry's existence; not an easy task to undertake. When Emma was captured by The Evil Queen, she met a female prisoner scheduled to be executed. Upon finding a way to escape, Emma saved the prisoner's life by taking her along. But Hook believed the woman's fate was to die and feared that things could be altered by her continued existence. After successfully getting her parents back on track, Emma, Hook and the prisoner found themselves captured by Rumplestiltskin and imprisoned in a room that contained his most unpredictable magic. With no way to escape, Emma discovered that her own magic had returned, and she was able to whisk herself, Hook and the prisoner back to present day Storybrooke. Upon their joyous return, Emma learned that the prisoner was none other than Robin Hood's wife, Marian, who was presumed dead in the previous timeline. Regina and Robin Hood had begun to fall madly in love with one another, but with Marian's return, their relationship could be in danger. And, unbeknownst to anyone, Emma and Hook also brought back Elsa.

             The Storybrooke residents do not know what Elsa has in store for them. Back in the past, in Elsa's kingdom of Arendelle, we will discover what happened to her, her sister Anna and Kristoff, and how and why Elsa became a prisoner of Rumplestiltskin.
            </p>
            <p>
             And now that Emma has brought back Robin Hood's wife, Marian, and possibly sparked the end of Regina's relationship with him, will she return to her old, evil ways and do everything in her power to get even? And newlyweds Belle and Rumplestiltskin continue to be deeply in love with each other. But Rumple is hiding a secret from Belle -- one that, if found out, could destroy their happiness - he continues to be the master of the dagger that calls upon him to be the Dark One. Can Emma and Hook commit to one another, and can these two damaged people take their love to the next level?

            <p>
             Henry is very happy to have both of his mothers back in Storybrooke. But with biological mom Emma and paternal grandfather Rumplestiltskin's blood running through his veins, he will be tested by both the light and the darkness.

             But the Sharks have a goal, too -- to get a return on their investment and own a piece of the next big business idea. When the Sharks hear an idea worth sinking their teeth into, they're more than ready to declare war and fight each other for a piece of it.

             This season, Nick Woodman, one of America's newest and youngest billionaires and founder and CEO of GoPro, will be a guest Shark in multiple episodes. Forbes magazine calls GoPro a "cultural phenomenon" and "America's fastest-growing digital imaging company."
            </p>
            <p>
             There will also be guest stars and specially-themed episodes, including ones featuring all-college students as well as all-veteran entrepreneurs. Episodes will continue to include follow-up stories, allowing viewers the opportunity to see how some investments led to success.

             The hit unscripted series, which will reach its milestone 100th episode in November 2014, continues to be a ratings force, regularly finishing as Friday night's No. 1 series. Last season,
             <i>
              Shark Tank
             </i>
             dominated its 9 o'clock time period and surged by double digits year to year with Total Viewers (+16%) and Adults 18-49 (+14%), marking the series' best-ever season on both Nielsen measures.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2012 and 2013,
             <i>
              Shark Tank
             </i>
             received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Reality Program. Additional recognitions include two Summer Television Critics Association (TCA) nominations for Outstanding Achievement in Reality Programming (winning in 2013), three Critics Choice Award nominations for Best Reality Series (winning in 2014), and three Producers Guild Award nominations.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Season 6, the Sharks are on track to surpass the amount of money offered each season in their investment deals. Over the past five seasons, the Sharks have offered more than
             <strong>
              $45 million
             </strong>
             to bankroll a creative array of innovative entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Viewers will continue to ride an emotional roller coaster this season, complete with heated fights between the Sharks,ingenious business ideas and touching moments. Whichever way the wheeling and dealing may go, many people's lives will be better off -- because they dared to enter the unpredictable waters of the Shark Tank.

             In the country's center of political power, Washington D.C., several kids have been talking about their imaginary friend. What the parents don't know is this friend is not as imaginary as they assume. And when the mysterious games they play turn dangerous, FBI child specialist Claire Bennigan is called in to investigate. Is this just a case of children being led down the wrong path? Or is it something far more unsettling... as she searches for the answer.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Halfway across the world, in the middle of the Sahara Desert, Defense Department operative Wes Lawrence unearths a strange, haunting geological phenomenon. Are these mysteries connected? The answer will force them all to face their greatest fear. That perhaps the enemy... is already in their homes. As the clock counts down, it's a suspenseful race to save not only their families, but the world. Before it's too late.

Now, he is ready to put his heartache behind him to search for the one missing piece in his life - true love - when he stars in the 19th edition of ABC's hit romance reality series,

             The 33-year-old Midwestern bachelor and self-proclaimed romantic has been engaged once before. Heartbroken, Chris ended that seven-year relationship just months before he expected to walk down the aisle. Although his relationship with his fiance was good, he didn't want to settle for "good." He wanted "great." While the humble but enormously successful farmer from tiny Arlington, Iowa (pop. 427) has found it difficult to date, that hasn't stopped him from having faith that one day he will find the perfect woman for him. His experience on

In the wake of the accident, Naomi focuses on Maya, her grandchild, and on a possible merger between her current practice, Pacific Wellcare, and Oceanside Wellness.

             Initially giving up custody of their child to Pete after enduring a near-fatal trauma, Violet has returned more mentally sound and sure of her role as a mother. Having bitterly fought for custody in court, Pete and Violet came through the drama not only ready to co-parent, but ready to be with one another. It's soon after this realization that the two decide to get married and begin a new life together.
            </p>
            <p>
             At long last, through numerous bumps in the road, break-ups and make-ups, Charlotte and Cooper are engaged to be married, but the trip to the altar may not be an easy one.
            </p>
            <p>
             The newest addition to the practice, Dr. Amelia Shepherd, is as gifted a surgeon as her Seattle-based brother, Derek, but is struggling to find herself as she learns to fit in with this close-knit group of surgeons. And Pacific Wellcare psychiatrist Sheldon Wallace is embittered after having pursued many of the women in the practice and come up empty-handed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The doctors of Oceanside Wellness and Pacific Wellcare work on the most difficult cases, patients whose medical needs often pose moral and ethical dilemmas. Though they may heatedly disagree at work, and though their personal lives may complicate matters, at the end of the day they are the best of friends, always ready to be there for each other.
