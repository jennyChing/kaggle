         When non-Jews ask about Judaism, they commonly ask questions like: Do you 
believe in heaven and hell? In angels or the devil? What happens to the soul 
after death? What is the nature of
         <a href="defs/g-d.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          G-d
         </a>
         and the 
universe? The answers to questions like these define most religions; in fact, I 
have heard some people say that the purpose of religion is to answer these 
kinds of questions. Yet in Judaism, most of these cosmological issues are wide 
open to personal opinion. The areas of Jewish thought that most extensively 
discuss these issues, Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism, were traditionally not 
even taught to people until the age of 40, when they had completed their 
education in
         <a href="defs/torah.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          Torah
         </a>
         and
         <a href="defs/talmud.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          Talmud
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <h3 id="Mysticism">
         Mysticism in Judaism
        </h3>
        <p>
         Mysticism and mystical experiences have been a part of Judaism since the 
earliest days. The Torah contains many stories of mystical experiences, from 
visitations by angels to prophetic dreams and visions. The Talmud considers the 
existence of the soul and when it becomes attached to the body. Jewish 
tradition tells that the souls of all Jews were in existence at the time of the 
Giving of the Torah and were present at the time and agreed to the Covenant. 
There are many stories of places similar to Christian heaven and purgatory, of 
wandering souls and reincarnation. The Talmud contains vague hints of a 
mystical school of thought that was taught only to the most advanced students 
and was not committed to writing. There are several references in ancient 
sources to ma'aseh bereishit (the work of creation) and ma'aseh merkavah (the 
work of the chariot [of Ezekiel's vision]), the two primary subjects of 
mystical thought at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the middle ages, many of these mystical teachings were committed to writing 
in books like the Zohar. Many of these writings were asserted to be secret 
ancient writings or compilations of secret ancient writings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like most subjects of Jewish
         <a href="defs/beliefs.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          belief
         </a>
         , the area of 
mysticism is wide open to personal interpretation. Some traditional Jews take 
mysticism very seriously. Mysticism is an integral part of
         <a href="defs/chasidic.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          Chasidic Judaism
         </a>
         , for example, and passages 
from kabbalistic sources are routinely included in traditional prayer books. 
Other traditional Jews take mysticism with a grain of salt. One prominent
         <a href="defs/orthodox.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          Orthodox Jew
         </a>
         , when introducing a speaker on the 
subject of Jewish mysticism, said basically, "it's nonsense, but it's Jewish 
nonsense, and the study of anything Jewish, even nonsense, is worthwhile."
        </p>
        <p>
         The mystical school of thought came to be known as Kabbalah, from the Hebrew
         <a href="defs/root.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          root
         </a>
         Qof-Beit-Lamed, meaning "to receive, to 
accept." The word is usually translated as "tradition." In Hebrew, the word 
does not have any of the dark, sinister, evil connotations that it has 
developed in English. For example, the English word "cabal" (a secret group of 
conspirators) is derived from the Hebrew word Kabbalah, but neither the Hebrew 
word nor the mystical doctrines have any evil implications to Jews.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Misunderstood">
         Kabbalah: The Misunderstood Doctrine
        </h3>
        <p>
         Kabbalah is one of the most grossly misunderstood parts of Judaism. I have 
received several messages from non-Jews describing Kabbalah as "the dark side 
of Judaism," describing it as evil or black magic. On the other end of the 
spectrum, I receive many messages wanting to learn more about the trendy 
doctrine popularized by various Jewish and non-Jewish celebrities.
        </p>
        <p>
         These misunderstandings stem largely from the fact that the teachings of 
Kabbalah have been so badly distorted by mystics and occultists. Kabbalah was 
popular among Christian intellectuals during the Renaissance and Enlightenment 
periods, who reinterpreted its doctrines to fit into their Christian dogma. In 
more recent times, many have wrenched kabbalistic symbolism out of context for 
use in tarot card readings and other forms of divination and magic that were 
never a part of the original Jewish teachings. Today, many well-known 
celebrities have popularized a new age pop-psychology distortion of kabbalah (I 
have heard it derisively referred to as "crap-balah"). It borrows the language 
of kabbalah and the forms of Jewish folk superstitions, but at its heart it has 
more in common with the writings of Deepak Chopra than with any authentic 
Jewish source.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not mean to suggest that magic is not a part of Kabbalah. There are 
certainly many traditional Jewish stories that involve the use of hidden 
knowledge to affect the world in ways that could be described as magic. The
         <a href="defs/talmud.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          Talmud
         </a>
         and other sources ascribe supernatural 
activities to many great
         <a href="defs/rabbi.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          rabbis
         </a>
         . Some rabbis 
pronounced a name of
         <a href="defs/g-d.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          G-d
         </a>
         and ascended into heaven to 
consult with the G-d and the angels on issues of great public concern. One 
scholar is said to have created an artificial man by reciting various names of 
G-d. Much later stories tell of a rabbi who created a man out of clay (a golem) 
and brought it to life by putting in its mouth a piece of paper with a name of 
G-d on it. However, this area of Kabbalah (if indeed it is more than mere 
legend) is not something that is practiced by the average Jew, or even the 
average rabbi. There are a number of stories that discourage the pursuit of 
such knowledge and power as dangerous and irresponsible. If you see any books 
on the subject of "practical kabbalah," you can safely dismiss them as not 
authentic Jewish tradition because, as these stories demonstrate, this kind of 
knowledge was traditionally thought to be far too dangerous to be distributed 
blindly to the masses.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to note that all of these magical effects were achieved through 
the power of G-d, generally by calling upon the name of G-d. These practices 
are no more "evil" than the miracles of the prophets, or the miracles that 
Christians ascribe to Jesus. In fact, according to some of my 
mystically-inclined friends, Jesus performed his miracles using kabbalistic 
techniques learned from the
         <a href="defs/essenes.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          Essenes
         </a>
         , a Jewish 
sect of that time that was involved in mysticism.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Sample">
         Ein Sof and the Ten Sefirot
        </h3>
        <p>
         To give you an idea of the nature of Kabbalah, I will briefly discuss one of 
the better known, fundamental concepts of kabbalistic thought: the concept of
         <a href="defs/g-d.htm" onclick="return ShowDef(this)" onmouseout="hideDef()">
          G-d
         </a>
         as Ein Sof, the Ten Sefirot, and the kabbalistic 
tree of life. This explanation is, at best, a gross oversimplification. I do 
not pretend to fully understand these ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to Kabbalah, the true essence of G-d is so transcendent that it 
cannot be described, except with reference to what it is not. This true essence 
of G-d is known as Ein Sof, which literally means "without end," which 
encompasses the idea of His lack of boundaries in both time and space. In this 
truest form, the Ein Sof is so transcendent that It cannot have any direct 
interaction with the universe. The Ein Sof interacts with the universe through 
ten emanations from this essence, known as the Ten Sefirot.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Tree of Life (Large)" class="WideLeft" height="334" src="graphics/tree.gif" title="Tree of Life (Large)" width="191"/>
         These 
Sefirot correspond to qualities of G-d. They consist of, in descending order, 
Keter (the crown), Chokhmah (wisdom), Binah (intuition, understanding), Chesed 
(mercy) or Gedulah (greatness), Gevurah (strength), Tiferet (glory), Netzach 
(victory), Hod (majesty), Yesod (foundation) and Malkut (sovereignty). The 
middle five qualities are mentioned explicitly and in order at I Chronicles 
29:11: Yours, O L-rd, is the greatness (gedulah), the strength (gevurah), the 
glory (tiferet), the power (netzach), and the splendor (hod). I have seen this 
passage translated in widely varying ways, but the Hebrew corresponds to the 
names of the Sefirot in order.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Ten Sefirot include both masculine and feminine qualities. Kabbalah pays a 
great deal of attention to the feminine aspects of G-d.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Sefirot are commonly represented as in the diagram at left. This diagram is 
commonly known as the Tree of the Sefirot or the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. 
There is great significance to the position of these various attributes and 
their interconnectedness.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Sefirot are not separate deities, as some might think by taking this too 
literally. They are intimately a part of G-d, and yet they are in contact with 
the universe in a way that the Ein Sof is not. The Sefirot connect with 
everything in the universe, including humanity. The good and evil that we do 
resonates through the Sefirot and affects the entire universe, up to and 
including G-d Himself.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Reading">
         Suggested Reading
        </h3>
        <p>
         Readings in this area should be undertaken with extreme caution. There is 
entirely too much literature out there under the name "Kabbalah" that has 
little or nothing to do with the true Jewish teachings on this subject. Any 
book on the subject of practical Kabbalah should be disregarded immediately; no 
legitimate source would ever make such teachings available to a faceless mass 
audience. Books written by Christians should be viewed with extreme skepticism, 
because many Christian sources have reinterpreted Kabbalah to fit into 
Christian dogma.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a nice online introductory Kabbalah course available from Aish.com at
         <a href="http://www.aish.com/sp/k">
          Kabbalah 101
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         For an academic and scholarly information about Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, 
check out the works of
         <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gershom-Gerhard-Scholem/e/B001IXS1YA/judaism101">
          Professor 
Gershom Scholem
         </a>
         . He was a prolific writer on the subject, and his writings 
are widely available and well-respected by both Jews and non-Jews.
        </p>
        <p>
         For a more personal and experiential approach to Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, 
see the works of
         <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aryeh-Kaplan/e/B001JX0XDG/judaism101">
          Aryeh 
Kaplan
         </a>
         . I am informed that his books are reliably authoritative and 
uncompromisingly Orthodox. I have found his materials on meditation and prayer, 
especially

         , to be particularly useful in my own devotional practices.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, if you are serious about Kabbalah, you must get yourself a teacher 
that you can work with one-on-one, either online or in person.
