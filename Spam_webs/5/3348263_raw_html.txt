          <blockquote>
           <p>
            There are numerous illness and diseases throughout Africa and many of them have similar symptoms. With most of the more serious diseases, vaccinations have been developed as a form of protection. Some vaccinations can have different side effects on different people, but if you are travelling to Africa you should always obtain specialist advice from your physician or travel clinic. Many countries have clinics that specialise in tropical diseases. The risk of contracting a number of the diseases can be greatly reduced if you are careful about where and what you eat and drink and who you come into direct contact with.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also worth bearing in mind that however careful you are, or whatever precautions you take, you will still be susceptible to some form of stomach upset which can be caused simply by the change in diet or climate, but these will usually clear in a few days.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a personal note having lived in Africa for fifteen years I think you have to be careful whenever you can and take the prevention and protective medicines and vaccinations available and suitable for you as an individual. But I also think you should not be overly paranoid, as this will spoil your holiday. I think it would be shame if the risk of disease should put anyone off wanting to experience this great continent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Below is a basic rundown on some of the more common diseases in Africa, but there are more...

             Aids
            </strong>
            <br/>
            HIV and other venereal diseases are widespread throughout Africa and it goes without saying that very strict precautions should always be taken. If there is a possibility the you will have sexual contact with an unknown individual you should take with you your own supplies of condoms.
            <br/>
            Hospital workers deal with AIDS victims on a regular basis and, contrary to popular belief, they do realise the danger involved in using unsterilised needles and in a town hospital or clinic you are unlikely to be at risk. But it worth bearing in mind that in remote areas, needle supplies could be low and therefore it is advisable to carry a few with you.
            <br/>

            <strong>
             Bilharzia (Schistosomiasis)
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Many inland waters in Africa, especially the central region are infected with Bilharzia, which is caused by parasites that live and breed in specific freshwater snails. When these larvae are released into the water they are capable of penetrating unbroken skin of their human host. The disease is carried by humans and spread by people urinating in the water.
            <br/>
            Bilharzia is now curable but it is obviously best to take precautions. Steering clear of still water pools, dams and some lower lying rivers, using an insect repellent like DEET before swimming or paddling and after swimming drying off thoroughly with a towel will give you some protection.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Cholera
            </strong>
            <br/>
            A public health concern in most African countries and is a bacterial disease transmitted mainly through contamination of food and water. Person to person transmission is rare.
            <br/>
            If you are in an area with poor sanitation and hygiene, you should only drink canned or bottled carbonated drinks, with no ice, and beverages made with boiling water. It is recommended that you avoid eating raw and inadequately cooked fish or seafood and uncooked vegetables and salads..
            <br/>
            Severe cases of cholera start with the onset of frequent watery stools and vomiting may also occur. The disease will quickly dehydrate you and it is therefore essential to ensure rapid replacement of lost body fluids and salts using an oral rehydration solution. If a severe case is left untreated, the patient becomes dehydrated with abnormally low blood pressure, suffering from muscle cramps, subnormal temperature, decreased urine output and shock eventually leading to coma.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Diarrhoea and sickness
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Even if you follow all the rules in the book, travellers diarrhea is unavoidable in most cases and nearly all travellers to Africa will experience some form of diarrhoea &amp; sickness . Diarrhea can also occur along with abdominal cramps, nausea , vomiting and fever
            <br/>
            Usually you will only be laid up for a couple of days at the most and the best advise is to rest, avoid heavy greasy foods and drink lots of non-alcoholic fluids. Popular belief of a quick remedy is a liquid diet for 24 hours. If you do not recover within 7 days and are feeling weak you should seek medical attention, some cases, such as Giardia and Amoeba can only be cured by taking a prescribed course of antibiotics.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Amoebic Dysentery
            </strong>
            <br/>
            This can best be described as a form of travellers diarrhea and it is difficult to distinguish between the two. In most cases of dysentery white cells, mucus and occasional blood appear in the stool and a medical examination is necessary .
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Hepatitis A
            </strong>
            <br/>
            This is a viral infection of the liver transmitted through poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation and intimate contact. Many people get the disease by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food stuffs but it is possible to catch the disease from your own hands to mouth contact, by touching a contaminated object or from the hands of an infected individual with poor sanitation habits. Again, by avoiding raw vegetables and salad, uncooked or undercooked fish, and boiling or sterilising all drinking water will reduce the chances of contracting the disease.
            <br/>
            The risk of infection is greater for older people and the symptoms include fever, lack of appetite, nausea, abdominal pains, dark urine and jaundice. Hepatitis A is very rarely fatal, even so you should consider being vaccinated before travelling to a high risk area, the vaccination has proved to be highly effective.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Hepatitis B
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Risk of Hepatitis B virus infection occurs through Africa, but it is only normally transmitted through blood, body fluid or sexual contact. As a general rule the vaccination will protect you but it is only necessary if you are likely to have medical treatment, including dental treatment using local facilities, or intend having sexual contact with residents. It is also recommended that healthcare workers are vaccinated.
            <br/>
            The symptoms usually are loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, nausea, vomiting and stomach pain. The disease is an infection of the liver and can last from a few weeks to several months. In some instances the disease is not curable and some people remain infected for the rest of their lives.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Lassa Fever
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Found particularly in West Africa. Epidemics have broken out in Nigeria, Zaire and Sierra Leone. This disease is highly contagious and can cause severe or fatal illness. The infection will start with increasingly high fever, vomiting, cough and general weakness which lasts for several days. Its' incubation period is 7 to 21 days. The exact cause and transmission of Lassa Fever is unknown and patients are isolated.

             Meningococcal Meningitis
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Epidemics occur frequently in the sub-Saharan belt across the middle of Africa particularly during the dry season from December to June. Burundi, Kenya, and Tanzania are also risk areas. You are particularly at risk if your spleen has been removed or you have a certain deficiency in your bloods immune system.
            <br/>
            Meningitis is caused when bacteria invades the membranes lining the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include painful movement of the head, severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, dilated pupils . The disease progresses rapidly so if suspected treatment should be found immediately.
            <br/>
            It is advisable to have the vaccination if you plan to travel in Africa.

             Polio
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Many people in Africa suffer from polio which is transmitted through close contact with infected persons or by contaminated food and water. The best protection is the vaccination (polio drops) and precautions in where and what you eat and drink.
            <br/>
            Once polio has been contracted there is no special treatments for a cure and victims are unlikely to completely recover, some people will have weakness in an arm or leg for the remainder of their lives and in more serious cases a polio can leave a person paralyzed and it can also be fatal.

            <br/>
            A viral infection of the central nervous system and can be carried by almost any mammal. Once the symptoms show, rabies is incurable. If you are working with animals or are likely to come in regular contact with them it is highly recommended that you get the pre-exposure immunisation.
            <br/>
            The obvious precaution is to avoid all close contact with all animals, even domestic pets, but if you do get bitten by any animal, scrub the wound with soap under running water for five minutes, then apply povidone iodine or 40% alcohol and seek immediate medical treatment for possible rabies and tetanus. Even if you have had the pre-exposure vaccine you will still need the post-exposure vaccine

            There are two form of this disease in Africa - "The Rhodesian" or acute which is founds in the eastern third of Central Africa and "the Gambian" or chronic, which occurs in the western half of Central Africa.. The disease is transmitted through the bite of a tsetse fly , the Rhodesian form being common in low lying game reserves, and sparsely populated areas, and the Gambian organism found in humid areas and along forested river banks. The Tsetse fly looks like an oversized house-fly, they bite during daytime and are attracted to blue.
            <br/>
            Symptoms include inflammation of the skin at the site of the bite, development of fever, skin rashes, painful skin surface, enlarge lymph noes and anemia.
