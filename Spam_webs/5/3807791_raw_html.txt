       here are only nine rooms at the  Casa San Francisco, but that means nine stories passing through.

       A hotel can say a lot about a  city. And a lot can be said about a  city by the type of tourist it attracts.  This thought has been on my mind for eight years now; I'm old enough to  have seen places change dramatically.  Now, as we roll into Granada, fresh from Nicaragua's pacific coast, this  thought is on my mind more than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granada, Nicaragua is the oldest occupied colonial city in the New  World. Its buildings reveal five  hundred years of chipped paint. It is  among a small handful of Americas most enchanting cities.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Those old paint-strokes are the hues of Central America: lime, rose, mango,  deep yellow. The city sits aside Lake  Nicaragua, known for its large size, for its numerous islands populated by  tasteless homes or unruly monkeys, for smoky volcanoes protruding from its  mid-section, for its sharks. Scientists  believed these sharks had long been isolated from the ocean by this lake,  transformed by time into a freshwater species.  But no, these are bull sharks, inland-waterway breeders, visiting from  the Caribbean. They make the trek along the riverine border of Nicaragua and  Costa Rica into this lake.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we arrive at the hotel, we are  informed that Terry, the hotel's co-owner, wants to meet us right away. We are mistaken for being famous, or  important. 'No,' I tell the hotel  manager, 'we're not with Moon Handbooks.  You've got the wrong people.'  The hotel manager says, 'Oh, just tell people you are, it works around  here.'

        e cross the street and go down the  way for pizza. The hotel had called  Terry to meet up with us. "You're  with Granada Department of Tourism?" she says. "Or something to do with Moon Guides?" I say, no, that isn't us. She shrugs, 'oh well, don't tell anybody. Just pretend.'
       </p>

        Terry and her sister Nancy live  unusually splendid lives. Both were  Peace Corps volunteers, but on opposite sides of the globe. Terry fell into the life of public service,  living as an expat in Chad, Sierra Leone, Pakistan. She was stationed in Afghanistan just after the war, and in Iraq,  just before.

        , Terry says, "You have to be socially  responsible." Terry has lived that  other life - the American who understands the world from street level, in all  its poverty and moments of injustice.  Terry has involved the hotel in a kind of community activism.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It's wonderful the  way they just live among everybody else," Terry says. She is referring to the dozens of  handicapped children who live in a shabby building not so far from the  hotel. There, they form a kind of  commune - making and selling artwork and clothing, their elaborate crafts. "But the owner wants to sell the  building, so we are trying to find a new place for them."

        ask her about what she thinks  about the influx of foreigners into Nicaragua.  By foreigners, I mean North Americans. In Nicaragua, North Americans  refer to people north of Mexico City.  Nicaraguans call themselves Americans  nobody in North America ever  knows that North America ends in the plush jungle of the Darien gap.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "I heard this wonderful  story," Terry says. "A woman  was getting old and almost time to face that big question; which retirement  home to settle into. But this one old  woman, she was ninety years old; she told her children she wanted an  adventure. They moved her to an  apartment here in Granada. What, it's  the right climate, they can hire a woman to take care of her, much better  prices than in the states. This  community, they'll take her in."
       </p>
       <p>
        In the hotels small courtyard,  there's these two age-ripened Canadians feeding the hotel's pet parakeets. They had lifted them onto their table, to  let them peck at their butter and jam.  Margaret, who was wearing a medic-alert bracelet, lit up a cigarette.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is it rude to smoke in front of parakeets?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She says that Toronto, where they  are from, "is all gone bad."  She says, "First it was the West Indians. Now its the Orientals with their gangs."
       </p>
       <p>
        "That's why we live part of the  year in Costa Rica," the husband says.
       </p>
       <p>
        "What brought you up here to  Nicaragua?" Jane asks.

       </p>
       <p>
        Being curious about this statement,  I prod them to continue. With the  parakeet licking butter off his fingers, the husband says, "They make  Costa Rica look like California!"

        Granada's unfortunate recent past  has saved it from Club Med and the Hilton.  Since the city is relatively poor, it is foreigners, many whom are  Americans, who have slowly been rebuilding the city, remodeling Granada with  new coats of paint. But these Americans  paint for Granada, in the historical style of Granada, and in tune with the  people of Nicaragua.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the afternoon, a great silver  cloud rolls around and over the volcano, awakening Granada's humidity  furiously. Granadans evacuate to the  awnings in these downpours; I take the cue to set my tripod in the empty city  square, perhaps knowing a thousand eyes watching.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pull my dark cloth over my head  and wait for my eyes to readjust to the darkness. But I feel sun on my back, and then voices, breath and  foot-stomping. I uncloak myself and am  surrounded. "Buenas!" I  say.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are all around me - actually  there 13 of them. "Just like  having your picture taken at Disney World!" says a middle-aged man with  receding hair and striped collared shirt.
       </p>
       <p>
        As if at a formal ball, I  take each of their introductions, starting with the adults. Fernando, originally from Costa Rica. His wife, Paraiso - they live in Managua  now. Her dress is blue, sandals  beaded. Grandfather is there too, with  a pipe in his pocket. But Nicaragua is  a country of children, and so each child in this large family introduces  themselves to me; their eyes and demeanor imply a respect for adult strangers  that might have existed in the States once.

        amille, Paloma, and then I come to  the last one, who is darker than the rest, and his hair shaggy. He is shorter than the children, but just as  curious, so I say, "And you're name is?  But I imagine you don't belong to this family?"
       </p>
       <p>
        The family laughs at this, and so he  does too, after looking at them. They  ask him his name in Spanish, and he responds with a smile. All 13 of them take turns looking at the  upside-down image under the dark cloth.  They recount their visit to Disney World, where they dressed up as a  frontier family, coon-skin caps, and a Disney employee took a sepia-tone of  them from behind a wooden Ansel Adams camera.  "Do you like Granada?" they ask. "Why did you choose to come here?" they ask. "Do you think our country is  beautiful?"
       </p>
       <p>
        The way they are dressed,  this family on vacation from Managua; their English-speaking, the implied  wealth: isn't it possible this family were Sandinistas twenty years ago? Brought into good fortune by the corruption  that ensued when the Sandinistas redistributed land ownership? And this little man, more Mayan blood than  Spanish, is it not possible he is a displaced campesino, a rural farmhand  driven to the big city? His profile is one of a counter-revolutionary. A contra.  These rural farmers - it was in many ways for them that the revolution  took place for equality after nearly a century of Saddam Hussein Somozas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wonder what compels these  Nicaraguans, both types, to be so forgiving of people from the United States,  our fingers always puppeteering in their bloody messes. Even the revolution itself was influenced by  layers of American imperialism. The  very word 'Sandinista' is a derivative of that Nicaraguan national hero,  Augusto C. Sandino, who traipsed across the country fighting U.S. imperialism  in all its forms.
       </p>
       <p>
        His strange story resonates closely  with many Nicaraguans. Even in Granada,  the burn marks of imperialism are still visible. William Walker, the American who installed himself President of  the country in 1853 and declared English the official language of Nicaragua,  operated here in Granada. He was  preparing Nicaragua towards its destiny - a great slave state supplying the  U.S. south with farm laborers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Central American countries came  together to attack Walker. As he and  his men fled Granada, they razed it, sending much of the place into flames.  Americans razing cities wasnt limited to just William Walker. A U.S. Navy commander was sent to a  Nicaraguan city in order to get a British diplomat to apologize for an  insult. The diplomat could not be  found, so the U.S. marines bombarded the city into smithereens.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After this 1853 event, the marines would land or  invade Nicaragua countless times, always under reasons whose sensibility is now  largely lost on history. Military  puppeteering in Nicaragua would continue through the 1980s.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It is a great irony then, that the Americans in Central America, certainly the  Americans who pass through Nicaragua, are this countrys great hope.

       verywhere Jane and I walk, everyone we meet, every Nicaraguan believes in the  inevitability of tourism rescuing their country. It becomes a part of almost every conversation. Tourism has now surpassed coffee as the  countrys number one industry. In  their politicians, Nicaraguans now seek men who understand the industry, what  drives people here, how to work the infrastructure along the way. Aspiring university students seek out hotel  management degrees.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The American who builds a small hotel in a Nicaraguan city, who learns its  language and its customs, brings capital and wealth to that city. He builds upon the citys traditions and its  beauty.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These Americans are already rescuing Nicaragua from its poverty. I know too well that Nicaragua now has a  choice: to rely on these expats and a budding tourism industry, or to fall for  the temptation of the hedge fund tourism developers who want to recreate a  slice of California or Arizona on their coasts, in their rainforests and  mountains.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jamaicas coral reefs have been destroyed by mega-developments; St. Lucias  culture is broken by cruise-ship tourism.  In other countries, its casinos and drugs and big money and trashy  tourists with dollars and steep expectations. Natives become aliens in their  own land. Often, they shed their  agriculture-based economy for a single hope: tourism. Their entire GDP, focused on one industry.
       <br/>

       In the April/May 2006 issue of
       <em>

       , an advertisement by the country of Turks &amp; Caicos appears to  follow the new model. The ad states,  Today, (our country) is quickly evolving into the worlds most sought after  destination by celebrities and the worlds elite. A multi-billion dollar investment in new amenities includes a  casino, deep-water marinas, championship golf courses, exotic resorts, and  world-class dining and shopping
       <br/>

       It is up to Nicaragua to distinguish between the American  in the gardening gloves, and the American in the shiny black shoes.

       erry invites us to her home; it is  newly rebuilt in an old colonial style.  The house is open to the sky, so that her kitchen and living room  surround an open courtyard. The weather  never changes here. Her walls are  adorned in the stories of her storied life; African masks given to her by heads  of state, portraits of humanitarian political leaders from the Balkans, a  Central Asian statuette. From the  outside, her home looks like the rest of Granada. She lives on an ordinary street, and when we leave, a number of  Granadans greet her.

       We ask an American ex-pat  to help find us a guide. Later, we see  her at the hotel and she shows us an apple.  Alison holds a small thing, a dainty little green apple thats really  yellowish-brown. "You know,"  she says, "somebody gave me this apple today. I'm really happy whenever I get an apple. You know, they don't really grow  here."
      </p>
      <p>
       She explains that apples cost  between 6 to 12 cordobas, which is about 30 to 60 cents. "Wages are different here, so you have  to adjust the way you live, you can't just buy apples. They are a fortune."
      </p>
      <p>
       Alison moved to Granada from  Connecticut, to work on her master's thesis in tourism management.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       "Would you ever consider  staying here?" I ask. I meant  forever. "I don't know," she  says. "I love it here. I mean look at this place." She kind of rolls the tiny apple around in  her hand, looking at it. Out the door,  horse-drawn carriages on the street, gliding fork-tailed flycatchers in the  air. The smell of dinner, the perfect  air.

        lison openly ponders her ability to  accept the culture here, for good. And  for this culture to accept her.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "It's different here. The men -  there is a lot of machismo - see, I have lots of male friends here, but they  are just friends. Back in the states,  we have friends of the opposite sex. That  doesn't exist the same way in this country.  So guys view me suspiciously.  They will say, 'what are you doing hanging around him.' I will say, 'he's just a friend.' If I would marry a Nicaraguan, everything  would change. I had to teach a  Nicaraguan how to use a washing machine the other day. They don't know how to do it. If I would live here, I would have to learn  how to do it by hand. Can I imagine  myself doing that? I don't know."
       </p>
       <p>
        She recounts working as a real  estate translator. "Americans will  come down here and buy up property, some of them don't want to learn the  language. They say, why do I have to  learn the language to buy property.  Its just a hassle to them."  She talks about the type of American who ends up staying down here, who  fits in. They become the culture.

        Alison finds a young guide to travel  with us. We shake his hand. He says, So youre with Moon Guides, huh?
