The reason \"beats\" comes first? Production. It&#39;s arguably the most important element of hip-hop. It&#39;s the cornerstone of every song, the foundation lyrics are built upon. They dictate the time-signature, the tempo, the tone of the lyrics. They&#39;re at the beginning and the end of the creative process that goes into each of these songs.&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;br \/&gt;\r\nOne of the biggest challenges in writing a list of the best beats of all time? The genre&#39;s soundscape is so wide-ranging and incredibly diverse that it creates some difficult calculation issues to work through. For example: How do you rank the disco instrumentals of early hip-hop with the layered samples and filtered bass lines of golden-era New York rap? How do you rank &lt;strong&gt;Too $hort&lt;\/strong&gt;&#39;s trunk-rattling bass against &lt;strong&gt;Swizz &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beatz&lt;\/strong&gt;&#39;s erratic Triton keyboard swipes? There are unlimited measuring sticks by which production can be compared. Consider the clattering, found-sound effects of &lt;strong&gt;DJ Prem&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ier&lt;\/strong&gt;&#39;s best mid-90s beats, or the raw, drum machine-oriented backdrops of &#39;80s rap, designed to shock the system. How do you weigh those against, say, a lush vintage loop from &lt;strong&gt;The Hitmen&lt;\/strong&gt; or a crossover pop smash from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timbaland&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;?&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;br \/&gt;\r\nIt can be broken down even further: Is the bigger, more-popular song the better beat? Or is it the underground smash that influenced the mainstream? Is it the track that best epitomizes an era, or is it the one that pushed the edge? To qualify the best beats, do we look at production that stands out apart from the verses and the hook, or is it the beat that complements those components perfectly?&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;br \/&gt;\r\nThose factors and more were considered by Complex\u00a0over a drawn-out process involving constant debate, strategically-deployed rhetoric, diplomacy, and fist-throwing that went all the way to the top. Ultimately, we drew up a perfect formula to determine an unassailable list of the best rap beats ever, full stop. When dealing with 30-plus years of music, a hundred slots fill quickly. As a result, a lot of classics were cut, and some of rap&#39;s best producers may not be fully represented. Them&#39;s\u00a0the breaks.&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;br \/&gt;\r\nUltimately, though, every production on this list is irrefutably essential to the advancement of the genre we hold so dear. They&#39;ve inspired, they&#39;ve influenced, and they&#39;ve been the impetus for a million neck-breaking nods.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, Complex presents\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;The 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Beats of All Time&lt;\/strong&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Listen to Complex&#39;s Greatest Hip Hop Beats playlists here: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLfv8hhuTqJGbsLhHGFEa8nF6kCMdrq3Hq\"&gt;YouTube&lt;\/a&gt;\/&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/open.spotify.com\/user\/complexmag\/playlist\/4pWuS7qNeSBO0kBLJZISkS\"&gt;Spotify&lt;\/a&gt;\/&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/rd.io\/x\/Rl4_WcQv_C5y\/\"&gt;Rdio&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2012\/09\/kanye-wests-50-best-beats-for-other-artists\/\"&gt;Kanye West&#39;s 50 Best Beats for Other Artists&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2012\/10\/the-best-rappers-who-started-as-producers\/\"&gt;The 23 Best Producers Who Started As Rappers&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2011\/02\/dj-premier-tells-all-stories-behind-classic-records\/\"&gt;DJ Premier Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:\u00a0&lt;a class=\"active\" href=\"http:\/\/green-label.com\/sound\/10-of-the-most-classic-hip-hop-albums-of-all-time\/\"&gt;Green Label - 10 Most Classic Hip-Hop Albums of All Time&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n","headline":"The 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Beats of All Time","alias":"the-100-greatest-hip-hop-beats-of-all-time","metaDescription":"Production is the cornerstone that every rap song is built upon, and these beats are the best the genre has to offer.

It found one in the Dr. Dre approved Jayceon &#x201C;Game&#x201D; Taylor whose debut album &lt;em&gt;The Documentary&lt;\/em&gt; became a classic in large part to its astounding production. Legendary names like Buckwild, Timbaland, and of course Dr. Dre all contributed top-notch beats but it was relative newcomers Cool &amp; Dre who stole the show with the 50-assisted single, &#x201C;Hate It Or Love It.&#x201D;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What made the beat so dope was the way they cleverly removed the drums at key intervals. It&#x2019;s best heard in the opening seconds of the song as 50 starts flowing over what we imagine a peaceful Compton sounds like when it&#x2019;s soaked in California sunshine. Then the drums kick in and the song takes off. For most songs that&#x2019;s enough, but not &#x201C;Hate It Or Love It,&#x201D; which does the same trick for the opening of both of Game&#x2019;s verses&#x2014;giving this fairly subdued beat more ups and down than you&#x2019;d expect.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe what&#x2019;s most interesting about this beat is trying to figure out which Dre deserves more credit for it. Everyone knows that 50 would later take credit for writing all of Game&#x2019;s hits, but when Complex asked both Dre (of Cool &amp; Dre) and Dr. Dre&#x2019;s right-hand man Mike Lynn about the making of this beat, another dispute of ownership was revealed.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;According to Dre (of Cool &amp; Dre) he onced played the original version of the beat for Jimmy Iovine who wanted to hear what it sounded like prior to Dr. Dre&#x2019;s magic touch. When Iovine heard the original he exclaimed, &#x201C;It&apos;s the same damn beat.&#x201D; However, Dre was willing to admit the Good Doc put his stamp on it. &#x201C;Dr. Dre had put the most amazing mix on it,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;A Dr. Dre mix is a co-production in our mind.&#x201D;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Mike Lynn had a very different take. &#x201C;Dr. Dre completely re-produced that track,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;&#x2019;Hate It Or Love It&#x2019; sounded like a sample, Dre made it sound like a record. If they play you their version and his version, they&#x2019;re night and day.

Each track was exceptional, a reimagining of the possibilities, from the urgency of \u201cIs That Yo Bitch?\u201d to the epic scope of Bubba Sparxxx\u2019s \u201cNowhere.\u201d His other major accomplishment was in how he approached rhythm; Timbo was one of the first to recognize that rather than being a formal defining characteristic of the genre, the breakbeat was holding the genre back.

The resulting track is so full of youthful energy and optimism that it's become almost mandatory for any \"lyrical\" rapper to take a stab at their own version, including J.Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Freddie Gibbs, and Kidz In The Hall.&lt;\/p&gt;","headline":"27.

In retrospect, the album version was an unusual song for 1987 in that it opens with Eric B. name-dropping the group's various representatives, features only a single verse from Rakim, and closes with some wonderfully off-kilter scratching. Thanks to the pioneering work of UK production outfit Coldcut, we also got the \"Seven Minutes of Madness\" remix, which added an amazing Ofra Haza vocal sample, as well as literally dozens of samples and breaks from TV shows, movies and other songs.

His reply? \"All About The Benjamins.\" It may have caused a few angry backpackers to spit out their guava juice in disgust, but it's a valid choice. Hip-hop started out as party music and this track captures the essence of a party to a T. D-Dot slowed down the start of Love Unlimited Orchestra's \"I Did It For Love\" and laced it with shuffling drums and backspins to create the catchiest head-nodder of the Bad Boy era. When the beat changes to the iconic Jackson 5 break for Biggie's verse, it marks a sign of respect to the park jam era\u2014a nod that was clearly appreciated by original party rockers like the Biz. Even Big Pun had to give it up: on \"The Dream Shatterer\" he told rival MCs, \"I'll even let you rhyme to the 'Benjamin' beat\/But it won't matter, your dreams still gone shatter.\"&lt;\/p&gt;","headline":"10.

They formed a group called The Neptunes and were discovered by R&amp;B legend &lt;strong&gt;Teddy Riley&lt;\/strong&gt; after a chance meeting at a talent show. From there they tiptoed into the world of hip-hop production in earnest, scoring early production credits for girl groups like &lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SWV&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;before rappers like &lt;strong&gt;Noreaga&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jay-Z&lt;\/strong&gt; started seeking them out&lt;\/span&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;By the early \u201800s you couldn\u2019t get through an hour of rap radio without hearing their signature sound: A mixture of brashly synthetic keyboard sounds and off-the-wall polyrhythmic percussion tracks. As rap quickly became America\u2019s most popular music form, p&lt;span&gt;op artists like &lt;strong&gt;Britney Spears&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Justin Timberlake&lt;\/strong&gt; came to them looking to liven up their sounds\u00a0&lt;\/span&gt;with a little hip-hop attitude. The Neptunes responded with lush productions full of live instruments, with string and horn sections fleshing out the sound. When they started feeling boxed in by that, they went back to the drawing board, delivering a series of defiantly minimalist beats during the mid-to-late 2000s that redefined the genre&#39;s production even as they genuflected to the sounds of the early days of rap.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a list of the &lt;strong&gt;50 Best Neptunes Beats&lt;\/strong&gt;, from their humble beginnings in the late \u201890s to their early 2000s hit parade, through their tinny synthetic funk period, their ornate live band phase, and the era when they broke hip-hop down to its base elements to reinvent themselves. Click through for a look at the finest work of one of the most reliably inventive and fearlessly adventurous hip-hop production teams of all time.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Craig Jenkins (&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CraigSJ\"&gt;@CraigSJ&lt;\/a&gt;)&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2012\/11\/the-100-greatest-hip-hop-beats-of-all-time\/\"&gt;The 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Beats of All Time&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2011\/08\/the-25-best-pharrell-hooks\/\"&gt;\u00a0The 25 Best Pharrell Hooks&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n","headline":"The 50 Best Neptunes Beats","alias":"the-50-best-neptunes-beats","metaDescription":"Get you bling like the Neptune sound.","primaryFocusTerm":null,"secondaryFocusTerm":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"datePublished":1362509932000,"mainSocialflowMessageId":null,"renderSocialflowMessageId":null,"evergreen":false,"limitMediaHeight":true,"pullQuote":null,"tags":{},"authors":{},"thumbnail":{"cloudinaryId":"ikcyu2lqopzhzo2nvsuv","format":"jpg","transformations":null,"width":620,"height":400,"type":"Image","caption":null,"altText":null,"id":499491,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405750533000,"dateUpdated":null,"class":"Image"},"mobileThumbnail":null,"source":{"email":null,"name":"Complex","domain":"www.complex.com","phone":null,"databaseName":"complex","mainDelay":0,"renderDelay":120000,"listingDelay":120000,"mainTwitterHandle":"ComplexMag","tweetMainDuringWork":false,"tweet":true,"useCustomPlayer":true,"useCommentPlayer":true,"workHoursStart":"10:00:00","workHoursEnd":"18:00:00","facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/complex","google":"http:\/\/plus.google.com\/+complex","youtube":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/complexmagazine","instagram":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/complex","metaDescription":"The latest in music, style, entertainment, sports and sneakers.","titleTag":"Complex | Making Culture Pop","facebookAppId":685812641524750,"twitterSiteId":13049362,"managementSubdomain":"www","timezone":"America\/New_York","hreflang":"en","workdays":62,"sfAuthorized":true,"canonicalUrl":null,"aliases":["www.complex.com","complex.com","omega.complex.com","manager.omega.complex.com","manager.complex.com","manager.www.complex.com","demos.complex.com"],"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405742962000,"dateUpdated":1436538207000,"class":"Site"},"renderChannel":{"name":"Music","shortName":"music","slug":"music","silo":"silo_music","twitterHandle":"ComplexMusic","tweetDuringWork":true,"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ComplexmagMUSIC","canonicalUrl":null,"google":"","ordinal":1,"metaDescription":"Stay up on all the artists that matter, from hip-hop to pop.","titleTag":"Complex Music","disqusCategoryId":null,"editorsPicks":{"name":"Editor's Picks - Music","id":10,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405746259000,"dateUpdated":1433264433000,"class":"CuratedLinkGroup"},"featuredLinks":{"name":"Featured Articles - Music","id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405746259000,"dateUpdated":1436542318000,"class":"CuratedLinkGroup"},"id":7,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405746260000,"dateUpdated":1406905742000,"class":"Channel"},"owner":{"email":"craije01@gmail.com","name":"Craig Jenkins","location":null,"alias":"craig-jenkins","attribution":"Craig Jenkins","imageUrl":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":null,"bio":null,"id":346,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405746254000,"dateUpdated":1418851255000,"class":"User"},"articleType":{"name":"Article","fullWidth":false,"id":1,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1413829384000,"dateUpdated":1416287255000,"class":"ArticleType"},"id":90067,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1405750533000,"dateUpdated":1415739269000,"class":"Article"}}},"id":5109,"dateDeleted":null,"dateCreated":1415741163000,"dateUpdated":1415741171000,"class":"CuratedLinkGroup","createdBy":{"email":"aleks.shklyar@complex.com","name":"Aleks Shklyar","location":null,"alias":"aleks-shklyar","attribution":"Aleks Shklyar","imageUrl":"http:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/complex\/image\/upload\/v5v3wfuf2fmwd5ff30st.jpg","metaDescription":"You already know Aleks is the man, but did you know about his plan?","canonicalUrl":null,"titleTag":"Aleks Shklyar is Awesome","bio":"&lt;p&gt;Aleks Shklyar does SEO at Complex Media.
