   What is a wage slave?
  </p>
  <p>
   So what exactly IS a wage slave, anyway? It's doubtful that you'd be exploring this web site if you didn't have
   <i>
    some
   </i>
   idea at least, but for the sake of ease, we'll clarify further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Here are some brief and incomplete definitions from CLAWS members:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Wage slavery is the state where you are unable to perceive 
choices and create courses of action different from the grind of 
the job."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Wage slave: A wage earner whose livelihood is completely dependent 
on the wages earned."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The point here, of course, is that we don't have a single agreed-upon 
definition of wage slavery. Many of us prefer to focus on wage slavery 
as a state of mind, while others prefer to focus on the external 
aspects of wage slavery such as the wage economy. But overall, we 
seem to sense something rotten at the core of what we've been taught 
about "making a living", and that's the place to begin 
our questioning.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Have 
you ever noticed how many of us seem to live "lives of quiet desperation", 
as Henry David Thoreau puts it? We feel trapped by forces beyond 
our control, trapped in a mindless job, for the sake of money, status 
or recognition. We complain that we never seem to have the time 
for what's really important to us, because our jobs take so much 
energy and focus that we hardly have anything left over. We plod 
along day to day; sometimes we even dread getting out of bed in 
the morning.
  </p>
  <p>
   We 
see the futility of the standard, socially approved path in America. 
It goes something like this: Go to
   <a href="../../action/reform/education.html">
    school
   </a>
   , 
get good grades, so you can get a "good" job, make lots of
   <a href="../../action/lifestyle/money.html">
    money
   </a>
   , 
get a mortgage and a car and a spouse, keep up with the Joneses, 
and be "successful". We know it's not the path for us; we want to 
define success for ourselves. But we don't know how to forge a new 
path for ourselves, because, well, what would we do for money if 
we quit? How would we support ourselves? Sometimes there's a glazed 
look in our eyes; it's as if some part of us has died. We are just 
doing time, working hard and hoping for the next promotion, waiting 
for the day when we can throw off our shackles, quit our dull jobs, 
and finally live life. Everything gets put on hold until we have 
more time, or more money. Meanwhile, life is passing us by.

   Perhaps 
you are one of these people. If so, CLAWS was created for your benefit. 
We have news for you:
   <i>
    <b>
     You do not have to live your life that 
way
    </b>
   </i>
   . CLAWS is here to inspire you to greater fulfillment, 
and to help you figure out how to get out of the endless cycle of 
living paycheck to paycheck and feeling chained to a job you don't 
care about.
  </p>
  <p>
   We 
have other news, too: It won't necessarily be the easiest thing 
you've ever done. You have a choice, but you may have to re-examine 
your way of thinking very thoroughly. The pull of the socially accepted 
way of doing things is amazingly strong, and trips up the best of 
us despite our good intentions. It takes a certain kind of independent 
thinker to be "job-free". We use that term rather than "unemployed", 
in an effort to convey to people that we're proud, not ashamed, 
of not having regular jobs. We also make an
   <a href="antiwork.html">
    important 
distinction between jobs and work
   </a>
   . All of us do some kind of 
work, though not necessarily for monetary compensation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another 
thing you'll need if you decide to rethink your beliefs about jobs 
and money is the willingness to challenge conventional wisdom. It 
will take perseverence, and a commitment to throw out the limiting 
beliefs you may have unwittingly adopted. This is not the path for 
everyone. If your priority is comfort or social approval, or if 
you're the sort of person who doesn't rock the boat, CLAWS probably 
won't meet your needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   If 
you embark on this path, it's important to know what it will ask 
of you. It may require you to disassemble, dissect, and tear apart 
your old beliefs, let go of some mighty persistent and tempting 
illusions, and build a new foundation for your thinking, sometimes 
from scratch. Are you prepared to do this? If so, you're in the 
right place.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even 
if you have seen through the false sense of "security" a normal 
job offers you, and already questioned that approach to life, you 
may not really believe you can do it. You may still have questions 
about how to bridge the gap from the old way of life to a new one 
that you envision. That's where we can help, dear reader. CLAWS 
would like to see you devote yourself to the life you've dreamed 
of, the life your heart desires. We don't want to see you waste 
your precious days any longer. Life is short, and the time to pursue 
your dreams is NOW.

   "The debt and work cycle is an ingenious tool of subjugation. Make people think they need all these things, then they must have a job, and they give up control of their lives. It's as simple as that. We live in one of the most free countries in the world, but we fix it so we are not free at all. "

   "When survival or mere subsistence is at stake, a society can focus only on the overwhelming needs of the moment, and questions of meaningful work and leisure are considered purely academic. But we believe that the world has enough wealth to move all of humanity above survival and subsistence."
