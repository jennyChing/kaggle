     <h2>
      Stop Trying Really, Really Hard to Get Off of Your Medication When Its Working
     </h2>
     <div class="entry">
      <p>
       My friend told me that she wants to stop taking her anti-anxiety medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its important for me to get off of it.  I want to try really, really hard to eliminate it from my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear in mind that this is a woman who has suffered from crippling anxiety for many years, to the point that she wasnt even leaving the house.  Countless therapy sessions did nothing.  Yoga, meditation, acupuncture, exercise, vitamins, you name it. Nothing, nada.  She was a complete mess until she met her good friend, Mr. Paxil.  And then she was much better.  At least to the point that we could have this conversation in a bar and not simply through text messaging while she sat alone in her bedroom.
       <br/>
       Knowing this about her led me to get on my soapbox about her desire to stop her medicine, to the point that I was told by the bartender to either lower my voice or leave.  Apparently I can scream all I want when the Yankees lose  and believe me, I do  but I have to use my Indoor Voice when discussing matters of health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before being scolded, I listed for her several valid reasons that physicians and patients will stop a reasonably successful medication regimen:
      </p>
      <p>
       <span id="more-194">
       </span>
       <br/>
       1)
       <em>
        Side effects
       </em>
       : sometimes the benefits of the drug are simply offset by the cons that come with it.  Most of my patients tell me that many side effects go away after a few weeks, but whether it be significant weight gain, loss of libido, dry mouth, dizziness, etc., some people decide that the gains are simply not enough to warrant continuing the medicine.  An extension of this would be when a patients mental health medicines are contraindicated due to a physical issue such as pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <em>
        The issues or circumstances that led to medical intervention have been resolved
       </em>
       : some patients need medication as a temporary band-aid to simply take the edge off or alleviate symptoms on a short-term basis.  I have plenty of clients who have panic attacks that are so agonizing that medicine gives them an almost-required relief.  They then go to therapy, learn the skills to control the panic and then make a conscious choice that they feel better equipped to deal with the issue.  At that point the drug is often removed.  Another example would occur when a patient loses a loved one and, for whatever reason, is unable to get out of bed in the morning or function throughout the day.  Anti-depressants are often prescribed to help the patient get to work and manage their daily tasks until they gain some control over their grief.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <em>
        Cost
       </em>
       : while most of my clients have some type of health insurance and can get at least generic versions of medication at a reasonable cost, this is not true for everyone.  Some patients simply do not have the funds needed to get the drugs that will help them.  And unless they have a doctor who will provide them will samples on an indefinite basis, some people simply cant access what will help them.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)
       <em>
        Dependency
       </em>
       : certain medicines such as Ambien or Klonopin have habit-forming properties and are often used only on a short-term basis.  Some patients need to stop taking these drugs after a period of time due to the risks involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive known you forever and none of those apply to you, I said.  So tell me the reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont like the idea of
       <em>
        needing
       </em>
       it, she said.  Its like, Im weak if I have to take the pill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive heard this innumerable times from clients, friends and even
       <a href="http://shrinktalk.net/?p=10">
        Dr. Pete
       </a>
       .  I almost always say the same thing in response.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you were diabetic would you bat an eyelash at taking Glucophage?
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend sighed, knowing where this was going, fully prepared to humor me.  No, doctor of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And would you even consider your own intestinal fortitude if you needed Zocor for high cholesterol?
      </p>
      <p>
       This time she rolled her eyes.  No, I would not, you pedantic dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its fine for you to have problems with your kidneys or heart.  In fact, Ill bet any organ gets a free pass as long as its not the brain.  Where did you even get this idea? I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on, she said.  You know the stigma.  You talk about it all the time on that stupid blog of yours.  Its just the way society looks at this type of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course shes right and, while the stigma has weakened over the years, it still exists.  Many people (most of whom probably dont read this site) feel the same way as my friend: the brain is the sole organ that you are
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to have full control over.  Unfortunately it doesnt work that way in real life.  The reality is that she doesnt have control over it and needs the medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youre actually being very judgmental to both yourself and everyone else who needs these drugs, I said.  So whats going to happen?  Youll stop the Paxil, become a screaming ball of anxiety again, and be strong because of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       She threw back a bit of some pineapple-scented drink.  I dont know, maybe.  I suppose I could get lucky and the anxiety could go into spontaneous remission.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all these years, I doubt it.  How about, as an alternative, you remain a happier person with the medicine instead of being a martyr? I suggested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, she countered, how about you go fuck yourself?  To solidify her request she stabbed me in the arm with a paper umbrella from her drink.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I think she agreed with me on an intellectual level, her gut was still telling her that mental health medicine = weakness.  And this is the case for so many people who rely on the drugs.  The point that needs to be drilled home is that, ironically, a weak person is the one who will not admit that she needs help.  Strength is the ability to say I cant do this alone, its not working.  You cant allow your mind to wrap around the notion that its a good idea to remove an agent that has improved your life immeasurably, only to return to a previously miserable state.  And all for the sake of falsely claiming strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are some people in the world over-medicated?  Yes.  Do some people use it as a quick fix, a way to not have to address their problems?  Of course.  Could our society strive toward a less biochemically-altered state?  Absolutely.  But none of this is applicable to my stabby friend who never did apologize for her assault on me.  This is a psychological battle for her.  She has to resolve the fact that there is likely something going on in her skull that needs to be addressed through modern medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know as of yet what my friend is going to do.  We saw the violence she is capable of when her medicine is keeping her reasonably calm, so Im pretty sure she could kill me if she goes back to her former self.  That in and of itself should make the decision an easy one, but well see.

        Another reason for quitting medication is curiosity about a life without medication, which you touched on briefly. Periods of long stability have a way of making you wonder whether or not you were really that bad. Its the dim hope that whatever was wrong back then is now no longer a part of your life, and now you would be able to possibly handle life without the benefits of medication. With that possibility out there, you become curious about what life would be like without the addition of the meds. I feel that at its crux its really a hope that the diagnosis was a mistake, and the symptoms just temporary (even if they have gone on for many years).
        <br/>
        Ive fallen into this trap myself: Im not really sick, I was just stressed/overwhelmed/young/suffering the effects of bad Chinese food, and I dont need these drugs any more because those things have changed. In most cases for me, the only thing that really changed was the use of medication, but I refused to admit that at the time.
        <br/>
        Also, watch out for those pineapple drinks, Rob. Maybe they just make your friend that much more stabby.

        doctor of sorts .. I love that!
        <br/>
        I live in a very nutritionally phobic aware community where taking one ibuprofen is akin to putting
        <em>
         nasty toxins
        </em>
        into the body.  So psychiatric meds are seen as evil.  Its one complaint I hear frequently and work toward countering. Or trying to keep it in perspective, is a better way of putting it.

        Great topic, Dr. Rob.
        <br/>
        After struggling with depression for most of my life, it got to the point (due to a culmination of events) that I finally decided to get medicated. A prescription and therapy with a psychiatrist likely saved my life.
        <br/>
        I was on the Rx for over a year, but then I moved to a different state and lost my health insurance. So I decided to see if I really needed it. I made it about 1 year before I, once again, got the point where I decided that the meds were not an option. I told my husband (who also suffers from depression), I thought I was better than that [than needing meds]. He said, No, were not. Its not a choice for me, its a necessity. And Im okay with that. Ive been able to start the Rx again because I make so little money I get it for free from the drug co., which is a huge blessing.
        <br/>
        Like you said, there are certain circumstances when someone might need to be medicated for only a short period of time. But for those of us that dont have that option, we should be okay with admitting that, too. Id rather need a pill than be dead.

        I never thought of treating the brain as another organ like your friend, I feel think this a weakness, to be overwhelmed by my emotions even controlled by them at times.
        <br/>
        Also, I dont think its just with these medications that people stop taking them.  One thing they drill into us in pharmacy school is that once people start to feel better, they want to stop taking the pills.  Or they just stop taking them for their own reasons.  I think its very difficult to be a patient, I cant blame them.

        Help me understand, Dr. Rob. Whats the difference between the patient you describe under scenario 2 (someone experiencing acute exacerbations which require temporary pharmacological control) and someone who is using the medication as an inappropriate quick fix?
        <br/>
        Dr. Rob: If a client has an onset of panic attacks or depression that incapacitates them (i.e., cant get out of the house and therefore reisks losing her job), most psychiatrists wouldnt see this as a quick fix, especially if the client begins to address the problem in therapy after theyve been pulled out of the abyss.  By contrast, many psychiatrists complain that they have patients who come to them at the slightest negative emotion.  They cant feel frustrated at work, their spouses are annoying, they dont want to EVER feel sad.  These patients are usually denied medicine or simply placated with it and need to be working through this stuff.  They treat the medicine as a Magic Bullet, the cure-all of everything wrong in life.

        Meds definitely saved my life, but I made the decision going into the treatment that I would work to change my patterns of thought/lifestyle that were getting me into trouble in the first place.  It wasnt easy AT ALL, but definitely worth it to turn your brain into your best friend rather than your worst enemy.  Ive been off them for a year and a half now and still feel great!! But it also brings me comfort knowing that if I ever fall into depression again, theres something that can bring me out of it rather quickly.  I believe in alternative therapies, but its true that drugs help you get back on your feet quickly  which is sometimes essential for survival.
        <br/>
        Its so easy to perpetuate damaging thought patterns yet so hard to break them.  I dont view anyone who has to go on medication as weak  life doesnt really afford us the luxury of shrinking away from it while we fix our brains.
        <br/>
        I wish everyone the same luck that I had!

       <p>
        Dr. Rob,
        <br/>
        Thank you for such an informative and truthful post. As a methadone recovery advocate, something that as you may be aware tends to cross the boundaries between pharmacology and mental health; this is an all too common issue amongst patients and Doctors alike.
        <br/>
        I tagged your post (and blog) with full authorship credits to you to some of our message boards. The feedback I received was grateful; as so many of our patients encounter Doctors who themselves push patients off a much needed stabilizing medication like methadone. It was a relief to so many of our patients and advocates to hear the words coming out of a Doctors mouth.
        <br/>
        Thank you again; may there be more professionals like you in the world. Feel free to check out some of the responses at the following links:

        Good topic.  One thing to add to the side effect topic are the long-term and often irreversible changes that can happen on some of the more potent psychotropics.
        <br/>
        Ive used the diabetes example, but pts often say, I know that I need [the meds], but it still makes me look crazy.
        <br/>
        btw, Sanofi-Aventis would argue that Ambien is in fact non-habit forming, but we all know it is just semantics.

        Yet another example of how Ph.Ds need to remove themselves and walk around for a bit.  You think you would have learned by now that there is no one fix for everyone and to promote one way over the other to your friend is just plain wrong.  If she wants to experiment then why not try to be a good friend and provide a safe back up to it?  Perhaps she would be fine, bu then again she may not.  To limit her options just because most of the time you have seen it not work is letting the 1 percentile fall through the cracks.  How did you become so smart without making mistakes? Let her make hers.

        @Kevin: you are right, a one-size-fits-all model is a horrible approach to mental health.  However, why would someone return to a previously attempted and failed model when success has been achieved?  Especially when every other failed attempt has been covered as well?  Unless its for one of the reasons delineated above, they wouldnt unless it was associated with pride, strength, or stigma, and these are poor reasons.
       </p>
       <p>
        You are clearly anti-medication, and that is your choice, but to advocate someone remove something that is clearly beneficial simply to let her make mistakes is being not only a poor shrink, but a bad friend as well.

        I am sorry if I came off harsh and even more sorry if I branded myself as anti-medication.  I know many people that benefit from it and I have been on paxil in the past.  My suggestion is not to let your friend try something that would be dangerous and have her deal with it, it was to let her try and for you(or others) to help her deal with it.  If she goes off it and is fine then great, but if she goes of the meds and then is a mess again that is an important growth point of life for her that she needs to to deal with to further her understanding of life.

        I simply fail to understand why people like to think of their brain as something separate from themselves. The brain is the person, and this stigma upon medication is an active barrier to progress and survival. I just dont understand why someone would prefer changing outside environment over direct chemical intervention. Either way, you are correcting the conduction of neurotransmitters to an established norm, assuming the medication is successful.

        I spent years in the cycle of going on meds/going off meds.  I felt so strongly that I needed to be able to go without medication, I couldnt even really articulate why but it was a strong drive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the event that ended that cycle was my own son nearly being taken by depression.  Within six weeks my beloved child was so sad, so lost and I could almost see the chemical storm in his brain.  We got him into therapy three weeks into it and had him seen by a pediatric psychiatrist during the sixth week.  Two weeks on the meds and he was nearly back to his old self.  He goes to therapy when he feels he need help or a tune-up, he takes the medication daily.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was terrifying.  It was also a cold bucket of water to the faceI need these meds.  In with all the good things my DNA passed onto my son, it included this glitch.  My attitude towards medication changed completely.  My son is not weak, he is not broken and neither am I.  We are simply two people with a problem who are lucky enough to be living in a time where help if available and with the means to procure it.

        Plain and simple.. People dont have mental issues because there is a lack of Prozac in their brain..
       </p>
       <p>
        Prescription medications may help with a few symptoms but the problem that they are address are still there. Medications have never been intended to cure but rather generate revenue by the patient being forced to take a medication for life.
       </p>
       <p>
        This also comes at the cost of countless side effects. Sure you may not been feeling the effects of an emotional disorder.. But have you prepared yourself for that kidney transplant your going to need in a few years because of the medication side effects?
       </p>
       <p>
        And guess what? Your going to pay for that too or die..
       </p>
       <p>
        Look for alternatives to prescription medications. Hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical companies dont make any money from healthy people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Its not in their best interested to make you well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greed rules all.. And your foolish to think it dont rule your health-care professionals too.

        I did what your friend wanted to so. I stopped. It was harsh. It was a process to get through the  not withdrawal symptoms. And i realized a few things afterwards.An afterwards that was months and months to get to with strange reactions.  I had been living a half life. I hadnt dated in years. I hadnt missed it. I had let relationships go shallow  and not noticed. I worked a job that was my whole life  and didnt mind. I wasnt me at all. But I held my job and smiled and moved along so nobody else minded. Sometimes it was fine. Mostly it was not bad. There were high points but looking back, it was not very deep.
       </p>
       <p>
        Im super glad I stopped taking (the last one was effexor). Am i solid now? Meh. I have depression and anxiety, but i will in any case. Nothing works forever. Bodies like to equate to their own idea of equallibrium. Hence the need to change prescriptions over time. Rather than bandaid it, im attempting to find a way to live with who I am. I dont think any prescription answer should be forever without a life threatening (dire and immediate) reason. Its like saying to use a crutch forever without physical therapy.

        According to my shrink, the anti-depressant wont be doing miracles. It is a 50-50, meaning that youll do 50% of the job and the A.D. will do the other 50%. It basically gives the individual a chance to work on his issues.  Thats probably why psychotherapy is needed even when the individual is on meds.
        <br/>
        My life without the meds was shallow, since I spent too much time focusing on my mood, and I had no room for anything else.   I feel that Im finally waking up, a bit too painful because I lost all of my teen years and a bit of my 20s (Im in my early twenties) but its something. I was tired of living like a zombie.
        <br/>
        I guess everyone has a different response to treatment.

        Huh. Where I live, in the U.S., doctors are almost never allowed to force patients to take medications. Ive never known a single person in my life who was forced by a doctor to take a medication. (Though I have known many people, including myself, who have been forced to take medications by the negative consequences of illness and/or death if a medical condition is bad enough. Its too bad that we get sick. But we do.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Me, I tried an antidepressant once that didnt help, and all I had to do to go off it was . well, go off it. I tapered off it as recommended over about two weeks and that was that. My doctor was all for my discontinuing the stuff, as it wasnt helping, and she wanted to help me  an attitude really not unknown or even rare among doctors; you seem to have known only sociopathic ones with mysterious powers of compulsion not normally found among humans. I have never met such but would love to, if only to see how its done.
       </p>
       <p>
        The good news is that wise and humanity-loving people over the millenia have labored and have had some success at developing things that allow others to be less sick, to recover entirely, to live rather than die. That is medicine, a thing not known in nature until humanity grew clever enough to look after itself better than Nature, which being a theoretical idea looks after nothing. Some natural processes and conditions and things do  those medicine seeks to bolster  others harm and kill us, and those are medicines enemy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would have died last weekend, in fact, if it werent for antibiotics, which we invented and which are not manufactured by the body and are thoroughly unnatural to it. I would be dead for exactly that reason, in fact; doctors had to introduce those artificial substances into me and disrupt the course of nature, which in this case was my body losing a battle with a bacterial infection of a major organ system. Yes, the infection was not caused by my body lacking antibiotics, it was caused by bacteria. So??? That has nothing at all to do with the fact that antibiotics were so necessary, I would be dead had I not been given them. If you think I should be dead, because unnatural medications are worse than the disease and death they can allay or stop, I disagree. And not terribly respectfully; if that were the case, you obviously would not respect me enough to think it acceptable that I lived, when that was at the cost of doctors doing more of those unnatural things they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Choose the ravages of natural disease and dysfunction for yourself, if you want, but know that others have a perfect right to choose healing; and that that seems infinitely the saner and unquestionably the good and benevolent course. You are very quick to tell others to suffer for your ideology; suffer yourself for it if you wish. Let others free themselves of senseless pain. Why that idea disturbs you so, I do not know; it is unnatural for a human being  to wish humanity to suffer on principle, and even sociopaths usually know better than to admit it, if they feel that way.
       </p>
       <p>
        News flash: Suffering is not a good thing. However natural. It may be unavoidable, but that is the best one can say of it. Well, and that it can teach people like you not to hold others suffering so light; but that is a completely circular argument  better if neither of you suffer more than you need, as far as Im concerned. We will all suffer enough; as I write this, children have died for lack of clean water. That is natural; it is an evil of nature. That you would give such things a free hand speaks worse of you than the medical establishment, by far.
       </p>
       <p>
        As for depression not being caused by a lack of Prozac in the brain  well, of course its not; humanity invented Prozac to selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. That was clever of us. Medicine is clever. It is unnatural  when the course of nature is that a person suffer, grow ever more ill, and perhaps die unnecessarily, we can prevent that. I say thats a good thing. Of course, I just got out of the hospital, and am alive to type this only because that malefic medical monster of your imagining took time off from the service of evil to diagnose me with an appendix that was about to explode  quite naturally; it would have if unnatural measures had not been taken to stop it, and I filled with unnatural substances like IV antibiotics, anesthesia, stitches, etc., not to mention temporarily  a surgeons fingers wielding a scalpel. And bless her forever for it. I am alive; the course of indifferent, mindless nature would have killed me, but human beings sometimes look out for each other. And most differ from you in not objecting.
        <br/>
        And if these helpers are paid for their work  well, should only useless work with no redeeming social value pay? That would greatly increase the number of people employed doing useless, socially unredeemed things, while utterly discouraging those who would like to work at more worthwhile things, but cannot do so if they cannot both work at such a job and keep fed.

        Kind of like food.  I will die if I dont eat food.
       </p>
       <p>
        And antibiotics werent invented.  They were discovered because they are mold.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, many people would not have died over the years if they had just eaten the right mold when they needed to, instead of food.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whats the moral of this story?
       </p>
       <p>
        People arent good at figuring out what to eat and need doctors to point them in the right direction.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, doctors are like farmers and nutritionists all rolled into one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except they farm mold.
       </p>
       <p>
        And the mold kills things.
       </p>
       <p>
        So maybe doctors are more like gun farmers.
       </p>
       <p>
        They grow biological weapons that you then eat.

        My life without the meds was shallow, since I spent too much time focusing on my mood, and I had no room for anything else. I feel that Im finally waking up, a bit too painful because I lost all of my teen years and a bit of my 20s (Im in my early twenties) but its something. I was tired of living like a zombie.
        <br/>
        I guess everyone has a different response to treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        So meds are kind of like the opposite of law school.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you go to law school and then work in a law firm, you spend all of your time focusing on billable hours and dont have any room for anything else.
       </p>

        Do you have an Axis I diagnosis Annie?
       </p>
       <p>
        Hey, Rob based on your experience, wouldnt it be a good idea to include lawyer as an Axis I diagnosis for the DSM-V?  Im thinking that you have to somehow combine the signs and symptoms for ODD, OCD, dysthemia, and anxiety disorder, NOS.  Maybe throw in cyclothemial, too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thats my psychological thought for the day.

        I honestly dont know if you are making fun of me, but yes, I do have an Axis I diagnosis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should add that it would be the opposite of business school as well.
