        Over the decades, IRC has steadily increased in popularity.
Although it was originally based on the metaphor of
        <a class="populated" href="/title/CB+radio" title="CB radio">
         CB radio
        </a>
        , using
terms like "
        <a class="populated" href="/title/channel" title="channel">
         channels
        </a>
        ," a lot of people who now use it are unaware
of its history.  They instead like to compare it to their local
        <a class="populated" href="/title/pub" title="pub">
         pubs
        </a>
        ,
preferring terms like "
        <a class="populated" href="/title/chat+room" title="chat room">
         chat rooms
        </a>
        ." However you like to picture it,
IRC consists of lots of people casually typing away at their computers
in order to talk to each other, usually about nothing in particular
but rather for the sake of having a nice
        <a class="populated" href="/title/conversation" title="conversation">

        with familiar

       <p>
        As is the case with most other Internet protocols, there are two
main pieces of
        <a class="populated" href="/title/software" title="software">
         software
        </a>
        involved with IRC: one is known as a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/server" title="server">
         server
        </a>
        or
        <a class="populated" href="/title/daemon" title="daemon">
         daemon
        </a>
        , and the other is known as a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/client" title="client">
         client
        </a>
        .  The server does the
hard work behind the scenes, keeping track of who's talking to who,
and you don't really need to know how it works any more than you
need to know how the
        <a class="populated" href="/title/telephone+network" title="telephone network">
         telephone network
        </a>
        connects your phone calls.
The client is the only software you need to learn to use, and although
it's a bit more complex than a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/phone" title="phone">
         phone
        </a>
        , I'm hoping this article will
help you to become familiar with some of its simpler functions.

       <p>
        Like all good Internet protocols, IRC is
        <a class="populated" href="/title/decentralisation" title="decentralisation">
         decentralised
        </a>
        .  This
means that anyone who wants to can set up a server on their own
computer.  Technical know-how aside, there's nothing stopping you
from running your own IRC server and inviting all your friends to
talk to each other on it.  The "
        <a class="populated" href="/title/relay" title="relay">
         relay
        </a>
        " part just means that two
people running their own servers can set them up to pass messages
along to one another, so whenever you talk to all the people on a
channel, you're not just talking to the people on the server you're
connected to but also everyone on the server that it in turn is
connected to.  By
        <a class="populated" href="/title/daisychain" title="daisychain">
         daisy-chaining
        </a>
        several servers together, large
groups of people can all talk on the same channels.  At the time of
writing (2007), the ten
largest networks each have over 20,000 people talking on them,
with the largest having over 100,000 users.

        Logging On
       </h2>
       <p>
        Let's get started.  First of all, you'll need to get an IRC client,
which is the
        <a class="populated" href="/title/application" title="application">
         application
        </a>
        that deals with the technical side of the
protocol for you.  Pretty much any client will do, such as the popular

        ,
        <a class="populated" href="/title/Colloquy" title="Colloquy">

        </a>
        for
        <a class="populated" href="/title/Mac+OS+X" title="Mac OS X">
         Mac OS X
        </a>
        , or
        <a class="populated" href="/title/ircII" title="ircII">
         ircII
        </a>
        for
        <a class="populated" href="/title/Unix" title="Unix">
         Unix
        </a>
        .  Once you've downloaded and installed one of these applications, you're ready to begin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each program is slightly different, so it's always a good idea
to
        <a class="populated" href="/title/explore" title="explore">
         explore
        </a>
        ,
        <a class="populated" href="/title/experiment" title="experiment">
         experiment
        </a>
        and read the help files.  Don't be afraid to
try new things out or deviate from my advice - it would be very
difficult to cause any real damage by mistake, so feel safe to wander
around.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once you've opened your IRC application, you should tell it which
server you want to connect to.  In mIRC, this is done by clicking
on "continue" to get past the shareware notice, then clicking on
"servers" in the list on the left.  You should see what looks like
a list of folders, which is actually a list of IRC networks - servers
daisy-chained together.
        <a class="populated" href="/title/Double-click" title="Double-click">
         Double-click
        </a>
        on any one you like to reveal
another list, this time showing the actual servers that make up the
network.  Find the one closest to you (although it doesn't matter
too much if it's a country or two away), and double-click it.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you're using Colloquy, click on "new" and then either type in
the name of a server in the "chat server" textbox, or select one
from the drop-down list.
       </p>
       <p>
        ircII is a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/simple" title="simple">
         simple
        </a>
        ,
        <a class="populated" href="/title/bare-bones" title="bare-bones">
         bare-bones
        </a>
        type of application, and doesn't
have any list of servers.  To connect to a server, you have to specify
its name like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /server ircnet.demon.co.uk
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Whichever client you're using, let's look at what this command
does, because you should familiarise yourself with the way commands
are given to your application, and they all follow this basic
        <a class="populated" href="/title/syntax" title="syntax">
         syntax
        </a>
        :
the forward slash at the beginning tells your application that you're
talking to it.  You're going to spend much more time talking to real
people than talking to computer software, so it makes sense that the
latter is the one that needs you to do a bit more typing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next is the command "server," which tells your application that
you're ready to connect to an IRC server now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, you need to supply the name of the server you want to
connect to.  Although all
        <a class="populated" href="/title/IRC+server" title="IRC server">
         IRC servers
        </a>
        are pretty similar machines,
each one has different people talking on it.  Some could be private,
serving only a few dozen friends, while others might have tens of
thousands of people from all over the world talking on them at any
given time.

       <p>
        There should be plenty of people to talk to on any of these
networks, but first you have to tell your application who you are.
You need to choose a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/nickname" title="nickname">
         nickname
        </a>
        for yourself, so that other people
will know what to call you.  It can be as descriptive or imaginative
as you like.  Bear in mind that the more people there are on the
network, the more likely it is that someone already has that name.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once you've thought of a name you'd like people to know you as,
you can enter it into your client.  In mIRC or Colloquy, just type
it in the box labeled "nickname." If you're using ircII, it will
automatically use your regular
        <a class="populated" href="/title/username" title="username">
         username
        </a>
        by default, so you don't
need to select a new nickname to log onto a server.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't worry if you can't think of a good name right away - all
IRC clients let you change it at any time with this command:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /nick ZoeB
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        If the name you chose has already been taken, the server will
tell you that you can't use it, and you can simply type in the command
again to choose another name.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you can see, I've just gone for my forename and last initial,
but the names of characters from novels and phrases that describe
your hobbies and interests are also common.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last step before actually starting to explore the IRC network
is to tell your IRC application your full name.  In this day and
age, it's probably a good idea not to give it your actual
        <a class="populated" href="/title/real+name" title="real name">
         real name
        </a>
        .
Anyone else on the network will be able to see the name that you
enter, so it's a good
        <a class="populated" href="/title/precaution" title="precaution">
         precaution
        </a>
        to just type in anything that
politely makes it clear that you wish to remain

         pseudonymous
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In mIRC, you can simply type your fake full name in the "full
name" box.  mIRC also insists that you provide it with an
        <a class="populated" href="/title/e-mail+address" title="e-mail address">
         e-mail
address
        </a>

         trick
        </a>
        it with this information just as easily.
It doesn't even look for an
        <a class="populated" href="/title/%2540" title="@">
         @
        </a>
        symbol, so you can put anything you
like here too.  Lastly, click on "connect to server," and close the
window entitled "mIRC favourites" that eventually pops up.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Colloquy, you need to click on the arrow next to "details" to
reveal the "real name" box.  As is the case with any other IRC client,
you can put whatever you like here.  Next, click "connect."
       </p>
       <p>
        In Unix, it's naturally a little harder.  ircII users can change
their full name by typing something like the following at the
        <a class="populated" href="/title/command+prompt" title="command prompt">
         command
prompt
        </a>
        before running the program:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         export IRCNAME='Emily Berkenstein'
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        From this point on, any IRC client will let you give it commands
by typing a line of text that begins with a slash.  Try the following
command, only with your own nickname:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /whois ZoeB
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        If everything's gone smoothly, you should see some information
about the user you're curious about.  The reason it's good to examine
your own nickname in this way before joining any channels is that
you can make sure no private information is being given out.  Just
remember: any information you can see as a result of issuing a whois
command is also information anyone else on the network can see.
Don't show any information here that you would be uncomfortable
revealing to a total stranger.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Talking to People
       </h2>
       <p>
        Now that you're relatively safe from the average person finding
out more about you than you want them to know, you're ready to join
a channel.  Every channel has a name, and channels that are
daisy-chained across the network begin with a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/%2523" title="#">
         #
        </a>
        symbol, followed by
a simple word or acronym.  On popular servers such as the four listed above,
typing in the name of a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/rock+group" title="rock group">
         rock group
        </a>
        or
        <a class="populated" href="/title/TV+show" title="TV show">
         TV show
        </a>
        you like is almost
guaranteed to get you on a channel full of people, as are general
terms such as the name of your favourite
        <a class="populated" href="/title/religion" title="religion">
         religion
        </a>
        or
        <a class="populated" href="/title/political+affiliation" title="political affiliation">
         political
affiliation
        </a>
        (although those channels can understandably have quite
        <a class="populated" href="/title/heated+discussion" title="heated discussion">
         heated discussions
        </a>
        on them).
       </p>
       <p>
        If this is your first time using IRC, it's a good idea to start
with a general channel that's not about anything in particular, so
let's try this one:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /join #chat
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        As before, you're talking to the application itself, and telling
it that you want to join the channel called #chat.  This will probably
be a relatively popular channel on most big IRC servers, hopefully
full of helpful people who will be kind to anyone starting out with
exploring the world of IRC.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations, you're now talking to people on IRC!  Assuming
that at least some people are actually paying attention to their IRC
applications, they should be talking to each other on the channel
already.  You might even catch the middle of a conversation.
       </p>
       <p>
        When people talk on a channel, most IRC clients display their
        <a class="populated" href="/title/dialogue" title="dialogue">
         dialogue
        </a>
        like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         &lt;Alice&gt; ...so that, in a nutshell, is the meaning of life.
         <br/>
         &lt;Bob&gt; I never thought of it that way before.
         <br/>
         &lt;Alice&gt; Just don't tell everyone.
         <br/>
         &lt;Alice&gt; I've already got all the psychiatrists on my back.
        </samp>
       </p>
       <p>
        You can now type in anything you like, without a slash at the
beginning, and it will appear on the channel.  So if you type this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         Hi everyone!
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Then everyone on the channel will see something like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         &lt;ZoeB&gt; Hi everyone!
        </samp>
       </p>
       <p>
        You can also pretend to perform actions by using the "me" command
to write about yourself in
        <a class="populated" href="/title/the+third+person" title="the third person">
         the third person
        </a>
        .  It may seem a little
confusing at first, but you soon get used to it.  For example, typing
in:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /me sneezes
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Will display something like this to everyone:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         * ZoeB sneezes
        </samp>
       </p>
       <p>
        You can use this to say absolutely anything about yourself in the
third person, so all of these are fine:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /me runs around excitedly
         <br/>
         /me kisses NinaR on the cheek
         <br/>
         /me wonders what the meaning of life is that Alice mentioned earlier
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        As you can see, it's a fun way of showing people what you're
actually doing, of
        <a class="populated" href="/title/roleplaying" title="roleplaying">
         roleplaying
        </a>
        , or of showing people your thoughts
without directly speaking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another thing that can be useful is the "away" command.  If you
start to use IRC so much that you don't want to leave a channel just
to do pesky things like eat dinner or have a shower, you can tell
your application to leave you connected but automatically warn anyone
who tries to talk to you that you're busy.  Try something like
this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /away Eating a yummy pizza
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Now if someone tries to send you a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/private+message" title="private message">
         private message
        </a>
        (we'll get to
those soon), they'll see the following
        <a class="populated" href="/title/reply" title="reply">
         reply
        </a>
        from you:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         *** ZoeB is away: Eating a yummy pizza
        </samp>
       </p>
       <p>
        After being advised that you're off enjoying a nice meal, they
won't feel offended that you don't immediately reply to them.  When
you're back at your computer, just type in "away" on its own to tell
your IRC client that you're back again, like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /away
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Once you've finished chatting on a particular channel, you can
leave it using the "leave" command like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /leave #chat
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the nice things about IRC is that you can talk on several
different channels at the same time.  Just keep using the join
command.  This can get pretty confusing on the command line, but in
a
        <a class="populated" href="/title/GUI" title="GUI">
         graphical environment
        </a>
        you can generally see a different
        <a class="populated" href="/title/window" title="window">
         window
        </a>
        or
        <a class="populated" href="/title/tab" title="tab">
         tab
        </a>
        for each channel.  It's worth noting, however, that trying to
concentrate on several conversations at once can make it difficult
for any of them to be meaningful, so use this option sparingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once you've joined and left a few channels, you may want to stop
guessing which ones exist and get a nice, big list of all the existing
channels.  This is done with the "list" command:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /list
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that just by joining a channel, you bring it into existence
if it wasn't there already.  If you're in a channel by yourself, it
doesn't necessarily mean that anyone else knows that it exists, although it will
appear on the list as long as you're in it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last of all, you can talk to people privately, just like
        <a class="populated" href="/title/whispering" title="whispering">
         whispering
        </a>
        .
This is done using the "msg" command, short for message.  For example,
the following will send a private message to Bob:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /msg Bob So what did Alice say the meaning of life was, then?
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Bob will receive your message.  Depending on his IRC
application, it might appear in a new window or it might look like
this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         *Zoe* So what did Alice say the meaning of life was, then?
        </samp>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you see a new window or tab, you can use the "me" command in
it, the same way that you use it on a channel.  ircII users, on the
other hand, need to use the "describe" command instead, like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /describe Bob is glad no one else can hear her
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is
        <a class="populated" href="/title/counter+intuitive" title="counter intuitive">
         counter intuitive
        </a>
        , but you're telling your IRC application
to describe yourself to Bob, not to describe him to anyone else.  As
a result, if Bob is using a graphical, window-based client, he will
probably see the following, just like on a channel:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         * ZoeB is glad no one else can hear her
        </samp>
       </p>
       <p>
        If he's using a command line based client, he might see something
like this instead:
       </p>
       <p>
        <samp>
         *&gt; ZoeB is glad no one else can hear her
        </samp>
       </p>
       <h2>
        Leaving
       </h2>
       <p>
        The only other command you need to know is "quit," which quits
the application.
       </p>
       <p>
        <kbd>
         /quit
        </kbd>
       </p>
       <p>
        Now you can go out and enjoy the sunshine, unless you got carried
away and are rather surprised to learn that it's now four in the
morning.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's a lot more to IRC, such as registering your nickname so
that no one else can use it later on, kicking obnoxious people off
of a channel, and sending and receiving files, but the chances are
you won't need to know any of that if you just want to make some new
friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hopefully I've convinced you to try out IRC, a simple way to talk
to people all over the world via the Internet, and I've helped you
take your first steps on that journey.
       </p>
       <p>
        If there's anything you feel I should have included here, or
anything I could have explained more clearly, please let me know.  Thank you, and
have fun talking to people
