        This is the era of internet. People rely on internet for getting information even about the smallest thing without checking the reliability of its source. I also did the same for buying the
        <a href="http://www.rowingreviewshubcom.com/" target="_blank" title="My Journey To Finding The Best Rowing Machine">
         best rowing machine
        </a>
        but to my amazement, every rowing machine was best and this is where I did mistake. I read just a few rowing machine reviews about a particular brand and model of rowing machine, all of which said it is really superb but when I started using it after spending more than $500 then I slowly came to know about its drawbacks. This was the last day I relied on promotional content present on Internet. I shared this unfortunate experience of mine with my friends and they also agreed with me that majority of the content available online is not trust worthy as writers manipulate the real facts in order to attract the customers.
       </p>
       <h2>
        God Help Those Who Help Themselves
       </h2>
       <p>
        I then started to believe on the fact that God help those who help themselves. Getting a rowing machine was my utmost need as my weight was continuously increasing and I couldnt go to gym due to my busy schedule. I was in need of a multitasking exercise machine that offers various benefits at a time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rowing machine is not only capable of losing weight but it also offers various other benefits. After wasting my money, I decided to do an in-depth research instead of relying on reviews available online. I used following means to gather some real time information about different rowing machines available in the market.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Firstly, I narrowed down my research to those machines which were most sold at Amazon and other such websites
        </li>
        <li>
         Secondly, I visited the nearby stores and used the machines myself for a few minutes to check their effectiveness
        </li>
        <li>
         Thirdly, I made a list of top features a good rowing machine must have and allocated points to every machine on the basis of that list.
        </li>
        <li>
         All the above mentioned steps helped me to find to top 6 rowing machines that are best.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>
        Your Food Is My Poison
       </h2>
       <p>
        I was also aware of the fact that needs and requirements of every person are different from the other. For instance, I need quality in everything I purchase; there are a large number of people who check durability or pricing. I divided all these 6 machines in to different categories keeping this thing in my mind.
       </p>

       <p>

        Secret Formula For Finding The Best Rowing Machine
       </h1>
       <p>
        Neither you know me nor do I. I know it is very difficult for you to trust me and information given by me when internet is already loaded with false claims and misjudgments. I am revealing the secret formula I used for evaluating the effectiveness of every rowing machine. This is just to let you know that I am not like other people who randomly pick up any product and start telling its benefits when they themselves do not even know how to use them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following is the list containing points I considered while reviewing every rowing machine.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Level Of Resistance
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_machine" target="_blank">
         Rowing machine
        </a>
        provides resistance either through water or air. Some machines also use magnetic or any other mechanism. Our concern here is not about the type of resistance but the level of resistance a rowing machine is offering. If a rowing machine is offering more resistance then you will need to put in more effort and this will eventually activate your different body parts. In other words, a rowing machine with higher resistance level should be preferred over others.
       </p>
       <ol start="2">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Features
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        I also compare the features of different machines in order to get better understanding of the effectiveness of a machine. Out of the 6 rowing machines I choose, some had more diversified features than others.
       </p>
       <ol start="3">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Durability
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        There is no logic behind buying a product with huge features when it is not durable. I also checked the durability of the machines as it matters a lot. An average rowing machine costs several hundred dollars and no one affords to waste this money by buying a wrong machine. To be honest, there were a large number of rowing machines having good feedback score but they had a useful life of less than a year. Almost all the rowing machines I have selected are highly durable with more than 5 years of useful life.
       </p>
       <ol start="4">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Noise
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Exercise releases stress but noise increases it so I specially checked the level of noise the rowing machine makes as this also affects our workout. Though, some people prefer machines with high noise as it gives them a sense of motivation and feeling that they are trying hard yet genuinely speaking noise does more harm than benefit. It breaks our tempo and do not allow us to concentrate on workout properly.
       </p>
       <ol start="5">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Comfort
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        A machine is useless if it fails to provide comfort. You cannot perform exercise on a machine which is unable to provide you ease and comfort. Therefore, I checked the seats of all the rowing machines personally while on a visit to a nearby exercise equipment shop just to check whether they are comfortable or not.
       </p>
       <ol start="6">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Weight Bearing Capacity
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        This is the thing majority of the people neglect while buying a rowing machine. If you are overweight then you must check this thing while buying any machine. I checked the weight bearing capacity of every rowing machine in order to know which machine is best for people with more weight.
       </p>
       <ol start="7">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Space Taken
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Majority of the people buy rowing machine for their home so that they can perform their workouts at their home as no one has enough time to visit gym daily. The problem with keeping machines at home is the space. Most of the people have limited space for their exercise equipment where they have already placed other exercise machines. They prefer a machine that takes reasonable space. I came across some giant rowing machines which I deducted from my list due to their huge size.
       </p>
       <ol start="8">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Ease Of Assembling
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Though, a manual or guide is provided with the machine that demonstrates how to assemble and dissemble the machine yet majority of the people especially those with little technical know how are not good at it so it is better to buy a machine that is easy to assemble.
       </p>
       <ol start="9">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Price
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Price is the major concern for a large number of people. In fact, majority of the people just check price and features while buying any product. This is why I also added price while evaluating every rowing machine. There were rowing machines above $1,000. I do not personally think it is wise to spend such a huge amount of money on an exercise machine when you do not even know you will use it for a long run or not. Amongst, the 6 rowing machines I have selected, 3 are a bit expensive while the other three are relatively cheaper.
       </p>
       <ol start="10">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Brand And Model
         </strong>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        The brand itself speaks louder than the product. People highly rely on brands. We prefer buying products that are from a well trusted and reliable brand and whose model is latest. I also kept this thing in mind. When it comes to rowing machines, then there are a large number of brands and models available in the market. At first, I became confused which brand and model to select but then I spent extra time evaluating different brands and finally I went for only those brands which had good repute in the market and whose products were considered best.
