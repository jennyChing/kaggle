   That'll be our little secret.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over, is the garbage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Remember our Golden Rule: A thin paint sticks to a thick paint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And that makes it look like birch trees, isn't that sneaky? Heh. Ha. It's gorgeous.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   We don't know where it goes. We don't really care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Any time ya learn, ya gain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Any way you want it to be, that's just right.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As my son Steve says, just 'smoosh' it in there. It's not a real word, but people seem to know what it means.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Be sure to use odorless paint-thinner. If it's not odorless, you'll find yourself working alone very, very quick.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Let's just blend this little rascal here, ha! Happy as we can be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Clouds are very, very free.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just put a few do-ers in there...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Decide where your little footy hills live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haha, and just beat the devil out of it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I like to beat the brush.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You can use a brush rack to hit the brush on. Otherwise you will become unpopular real fast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If you did this with yellow, and you went over it with blue, you would end up with a .. with a translucent... green. And it's gorgeous. It is GORGEOUS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If you did this with blue, and you went over it with yellow, you would end up with a nice green sky. And that's not the thing we are looking for.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just lightly blend it, one hair and some air.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tender as a mothers love... And with my mother, that was certainly true.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Let's do a little cabinectomy here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oh, you'd be in Agony City by now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just scrape in a few indications of sticks and twigs and other little things in there. People will think you spend hours doing this.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Little raccoons and old possums 'n' stuff all live up in here. They've got to have a little place to sit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Little squirrels 'n' rabbits, and if this was in Florida or Georgia somewhere down there, might be an alligator or two hid back here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Maybe in our world there lives a happy little tree over there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oh, green water... oh that's pretty. Boy, I like that, just alive with algae.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oh, that would make a nice place to fish. I like fishing, but I'm not a very good fisherman. I always throw the fish back into the water, just put a band-aid on his mouth, tap 'im on the patootie and let him on his way. And maybe some day, if I'm lucky, I'll get to catch him again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oooh, if you have never been to Alaska, go there while it is still wild. My favorite uncle asked me if I wanted to go there, Uncle Sam. He said if you don't go, you're going to jail. That is how Uncle Sam asks you.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   People look at me like I'm a little strange, when I go around talking to squirrels and rabbits and stuff. That's ok. Thaaaat's just ok.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   People might look at you a bit funny, but it's okay. Artists are allowed to be a bit different.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shwooop. Hehe. You have to make those little noises, or it just doesn't work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talk to the tree, make friends with it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I taught my son to paint mountains like these, and guess what? Now he paints the best darn mountains in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That's where the crows will sit. But we'll have to put an elevator to put them up there because they can't fly, but they don't know that, so they still try.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trees are oh so soft, oh so soft I freakin' love it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Try to imagine that you are a tree. How do you want to look out here?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Water's like me. It's laaazy... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We want happy paintings. Happy paintings. If you want sad things, watch the news.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We're gonna make some big decisions in our little world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Well, the little clock on the wall says we're just about out of time. God bless you my friend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   From all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting...and God bless my friend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When I was teaching my son Steve to paint, I used to tell him, just pretend he was a whisper, and he floated right across the mountain, that easy, gentle, make love to it, caress it.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>

   I can't go over 30 minutes, because we have a mean ol' director with no sense of humor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You can put as many or as few as you want in your world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Even if you've never painted before, this one you can do.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is the hardest part of this method. If you can do this, you can do anything.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Roll it in a little bright red and lets sign this right in here. Luckily I have a short name so it's easy to sign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And just go straight in like your going to stab it. And barely touch it...barely touch it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When we teach people to paint this is the one they fall in love with. It works so well.
