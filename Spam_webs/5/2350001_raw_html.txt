       <p>
        The argument is simple enough. If a person is born a certain way, who are we to judge what they are? A person born with black skin is that way because of his or her genes. Weve been told that homosexuality is gene-directed. A persons DNA determines sexual attraction and identity even though the sexual organs in same-sex relationships do not line up with the genetic makeup of people of the same sex.
       </p>
       <p>
        One would think that sexual normalcy would coincide with sexual reproduction. Its a rational and scientific judgment to make. Homosexuality stops the transfer of DNA to a new generation. One would think that science alone would be enough to conclude that same-sex sex is genetically counterproductive.
       </p>
       <p>
        One way to test a hypothesis is to find similar test subjects. Twin studies have frequently been used to test genetic theories. The latest twin studies regarding homosexuality are giving more evidence that
        <a href="http://www.hollanddavis.com/?p=3647">
         homosexuality is not DNA determined
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
        Eight major studies of identical twins in Australia, the U.S., and Scandinavia during the last two decades all arrive at the same conclusion: gays were not born that way. . . .
       </p>
       <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="text-align:right;margin:8px 0px;">
        <div id="div-gpt-ad-1397851655942-1" style="width:300px; height:250px;">
         <script type="text/javascript">
          googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1397851655942-1'); });
         </script>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
        Identical twins have the same genes or DNA. They are nurtured in equal prenatal conditions. If homosexuality is caused by genetics or prenatal conditions and one twin is gay, the co-twin should also be gay.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
        Because they have identical DNA, it ought to be 100%, Dr. [Neil] Whitehead notes. But the studies reveal something else. If an identical twin has same-sex attraction the chances the co-twin has it are only about 11% for men and 14% for women.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
        Because identical twins are always genetically identical, homosexuality cannot begenetically dictated. No-one is born gay, he notes. The predominant things that create homosexuality in one identical twin and not in the other have to be post-birth factors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know two sets of twins where this is true. Of course, my sample is very small, but it is an indication that DNA is not the predominate factor in the sexual choices people make.
       </p>
       <p>
        But lets assume that DNA does determine sexual preference. What if a case could be made that DNA determines if a person has sexual desires for children? Would this then mean that the ensuing behavior would have to be legitimized by state legislatures and anti-discrimination laws would be put in place?
       </p>
       <p>
        Where do we stop with DNA-determined behavior? Why are some DNA-determined behaviors good and others bad? Consider the following and ask yourself this question: Why are scientists working to overcome these genetic irregularities but not homosexuality which is genetically counter productive?:

            It is humorous to make absolute determinations based on studies. Gay individuals have no genetic predisposition for this proclivity but how does one find genetic markers or genomes that control the ellusive concept of thought, consciousness or awareness believed to exist in the human brain. There are homosexual mammals who do not have a conscious thought about gay choices.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where these attributes exist cannot be determined in a lab or by looking at the brain with scans. For the brain of all animals including man cannot be aware of thoughts, desires, consciousness, awareness or any other emotion. For when man or animals dies, the body including the brain returns to dust. Does dust (matter) think or is dust conscious?
           </p>
           <p>
            For humans of finite brain wisdom to make such conclusions is absurd. If you were to divide each particle or piece of matter in an attempt to find a basic (god) particle from which all matter is created is impossible. For science now understands that all of the universe exists only in some sort of unknown inner eye for all organisms including man.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would take an infinite wisdom to create such an illusion.

              Why do you compare human beings to animals when they eat their own excrement and are not Rational and Moral. Some eat their own young. We have been given Rationalityit is irrational to desire putting ones life-giving member in a hole where excrement is vacated. (Or in holes in the walls at bathhouses). The idea is learned like all the homosexual cultures prove (Samurai, Spartan (twin studies), Ancient Civilizations, Saudis who prefer the boys for sex, The Afghanis who have harems of boys. It is Learned behavior as ALL BEHAVIORSby cultural influences and a warping of Natural Laws in childrenusually by raping them.

              Homosexual are trying to recruit children for decades with brainwashing and conditioning them to take Pride in Anal Sexforced in the schools to destroy Christian Ethics.

             <p>
              Anal sex is irrational and vile and dehumanizing. There is no Reason in such meaningless, vile, disease-causing use of the human body.

                  No it cantit is degeneracy and vice and unnaturalthat Deep Throat movie agitprop to popularize homosexuality/sodomy (now Shades of Grey) and destroy Christian Ethics in children/teenagers was the beginning of a herpes epidemic, STDs, and divorce epidemic. Prior to Kinsey and the sex revolutionperversion was very rare in the USA (Kinsey was a sex pervert and hired pedophiles who molested babies for his sick work. His data has been ejected.although the effects of his work infiltrated into the culture and corrupted teenagers.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Ancient pagan/occult cultures (like Afghanistan today where boys are in harems and sodomized-) culture normalizes behavior. Our children have been forced (brainwashed) for decades (you, too) to think sodomy is Good and Natural when it is vile and dehumanizing and strips dignity from all parties who engage in such filthy acts which cause disease and misuse the body. It makes human beings into a commodity which is extremely evil.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sick behavior is learned and promoted by cultures (Weimar Republic 1919 was vulgarall art was degenerate, and homosexuality was the National Vice) . The Atheist/sodomites controlling colleges and publishing companies forced literature by The Beats on kidsGinsberg and his homosexual orgy friends who wrote about hanging boys with er*ctions and sodomizing them were on best seller lists and forced reading in classes to desensitize kids to promiscuity which was rare in pre-Kinsey, pre-hugh hefner America. Our courts eliminated obscenity laws because of the sodomites promoting The Beats so our children could be corrupted.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Just because children are being brainwashed by Satanists/Lucifereans/Skull and Bones Owl worshippers who worship their goat god in sodomizing Rites and they need boys for their altars- they need to popularize sodomy and force children to take Pride in anal sex (its Natural, You know!!!!!!)using the Prussian school system created for mass indoctrination (John Dewey was a Fabian Socialist (probably sodomite like the Fabian Sugar Keynesthe idol of Leftists and Communists.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  These sick minds control the Boy Scouts NOW, even. You have to get young boys to believe Evil is Good so it will warp their whole foundation and way they look at other malesthey have to get the mind of boys and sexualize them early and normalize unnatural sex so they are not appalled by fecal matter .

                  You are irrationalas Ayn Rand called all Marxist, Postmodernists/sodomites like Sugar Keynes who castrated little boys, that sodomite atheists/Fabian Socialist/Luciferean. Rand was an Atheist but condemned homosexuality (she enshrined Natural Law, like our Constitution). She understood Natural Law Theory where Reason and Logic and Science originate. You eject Natural Law (Science). Sodomy is not only vile and unnaturalit is entirely irrational, like you. Focusing on an anal cavity is beyond vulgar and dehumanizing and animalistic.

                 <p>
                  Just so you know, Anton LeVay based his religion of Satanism and his Satanic Bible on Ayn Rands teachings. Rand herself was a Christianity-hating atheist who taught the point-for-point 180 diametric opposite of the teachings of Jesus Christ in almost every aspect, and in fact Jesus said that doing what Ayn Rand said was right (enlightened self-interest aka selfishness) was what puts people among the Damned Goats on His Left Hand, and that doing what she called evil (altruism) was what put them among the Saved Sheep on His Right Hand when He comes to judge all the nations for the Final Judgement as He Himself described in detail in Matthew 25:3146 (arguably the single most important passage in all of scripture if Christianity turns out to be true).

                  I am a Thomistnot a Randian, although I do endorse some of Rands genius. Just as St. Thomas recognized genius in the pagan, Aristotle, and St. Augustine recognized genius in Plato. Just because someone doesnt have the complete Truthand who does on earthis no reason to throw out the ideas that are exceptional.

                  Rand understood Marx and that was her genius. That she rejected God was understandablebeing raised in her formative years in a nation that reviled God, particularly Christianity. Childhood usually forms worldview.

                  Christianity is the greatest force in Western Civilizationwhich led to the Age of Reason and the Renaissance (Common Law/individualismdignity and worth for women, which never occurred in non-Western countries where women are still treated like cattle.)

                  Individualism is a Christian conceptand not possible in pantheism/occultism/atheismall collectivist societies where the individual can be eliminated/exterminated. Christian Ethics does not allow human beings to be used as a Means to an End. Marxism does. Every other ethic is incompatible with the US Constitution, based on Christian Ethics, which because of St. Thomasenshrined Natural Law Theory. With no understanding of Natural Law (Science and Logic and Common Sense) there can be no Civil society and Natural Rights from Godthe basis of US Law and the concepts of Rule of Law (Higher Law).

                  The very early (pre-Paul) Christian Church was proto-Marxist. Acts 2:4445 used language that is practically verbatim identical to Marxs own very famous summary of Marxism, to describe the socioeconomic system that they actually implemented, apparently successfully (so much for the tired Marxism has failed every time its been tried canard). This language is used again, along with an actual example of this proto-Marxist socioeconomic system working as it was intended to work, in Acts 4:3137. Verse 37 is the last verse of that chapter, but the discussion of that system continues across the chapter boundary into Acts 5:111, in which Peter, empowered by Almighty God Himself,
                  <i>
                   divinely
                  </i>

                  And besides, all of this was a lame red herring to try to hide the fact that you are flatly, demonstrably, provably wrong in your original assertion which I refuted: namely, that heterosexual couples can and do perform anal intercourse. Its not strictly a male homosexual thing.

                  Rousseau was proto-Marxist, you idiot. He believe men were born Good and man-madeCulture created the chains (rules)the exact same as Marxand the opposite of Christianity, which knows that man is born with original sinevil and Revelation/God laid out the Rules. Man is totally depravedand yes, people are perverse and do evil thingsthey even kill but that doesnt mean it is Goodthat is why Virtue needs to be inculcated in children so they dont have obsessions with an anal cavity and call it Good and Normal. What a sick, ugly unnatural concept.

                  The Catholic Church (and the Bible) has the family unit as the most basic element of civil society (government)and the most importantand subsidiarity is crucial in the Catholic Canonlook it up! that is autonomyleast government interference is the bestthe concept of John Locke/Adam Smith (opposite of Marx)government is always force (bureaucracy/inhumane) and evil and tyrannical.

                  This gross inhumane idea that children can form naturally without their biological parents who would have genetic interest in their survival, is EVIL-I just saw the movie Buckabout a horse which had his natural environment destroyedhe was an orphan. They had to kill him at age 3 because he was so perverted by not having been raised with other horses he couldnt interact with themsame with humans-artificial environments which deny children their Natural Rights of a biological mother and fatheris warping the worldview of a child. It perverts their worldviewjust like the harems pervert the little boys in Afghanistan who learn that sodomy is good and enjoy being sodomizedtrained like the Samurai trained the boys and the Bolsheviks/Freemasons who worship goat-gods and have sodomy Rites to mock Gods Designand the Greeks and other pagan/occult/Atheist/Marxist Ethics. It is Frankensteinianthe opposite of Christian Ethics which is aligned with Natural Law Theory because of St. Thomas A. and the Summa-Logic and Reason and Science comes from Natural Law TheoryIt is why Christianity created the Age of Reason and the RenaissanceThe most brilliant ideas/science/art happened because of Christian Ethicscouldnt happen without that ideology. Even Einstein wouldnt have been who he wasor think the way he didif he hadnt been raised in a Christian Culturethe atheists almost got him, but Christianity was still strong in America where he was embraced.

            No one is a sodomite until he engages in sodomy any more than someone is a murderer until he engages in murder. Yahweh (God of the Bible) does not condemn someone to death for a proclivity, only for the act itself (Leviticus 20:13).

            I really dont care. But just dont force it on me and don t make me change all the laws to accomodate youre pretending that you are the same as a man and a woman in mariage. You are not. A teacher friend told me about children in her class with multiple brothers and sisters whose divorced mother all of a sudden decided she was gay and the parade of new mothers starts to roll through their house. Now these kids are being taught to say they have 2 mothers and a father. Talk about scewing kids up. I put this right along with child abuse but our statist government encourages this kind of behavior. My friend the teacher does what she can to build confidence in these children.

            so to look at this from an equality standpoint. Homosexuality is genetically based and thus i must accept them as they are since their genetics as not their fault. fair enough, however to extend this chain of thought based on the same science, my aggressive behavior is genetic, and thus i cannot be penalized for it, irregardless of how much damage i do since its genetic and i cannot be held responsible for my genetic makeup. In addition, as pointed out, bigitry is a genetic condition due to evolution, survival of my group, and thus i cannot be held responsible for what i do in pursuit of this genetically induced behavior. You just have to accept it, its genetics and i have no control over it.
           </p>
           <p>
            how far do we want to go with this in the name of equality and its not my fault?

            This leads to the question that has been bothering me.those who claim they are the opposite sex of what their body is. Having read alot on this subject I am aware that this condition does happen but it is rare. So then why is today we have a growing number of children, teens and adults all claiming to have this condition? If it is indeed a rare medical occurance as research indicates it is then the only explanation would be parental attitude towards this which in effect encourages children to believe they have this condition and to expect society to accept it as their parents did.

            In the 1990s (the Decade of the Brain proclaimed by George HW Bush in 1990) there was a revolution in neuroscience. The 1000 trillion interconnections of 100 billion brain cells was found to be directed, not be human DNA (34,000 genes; 17,000 focused on brain development), but by mental focus (Jeffrey Schwarz, 2002, and many others). In the early 1990s, two hypotheses were floated: 1: Religious behavior is caused by a God gene (Time, Oct 2004 cover) and 2. Homesexual behavior is caused by a homosexual gene. Both hypotheses were promoted by Dr. Gene Hamer of the National Institutes of Health in Wash DC. Hamer (despite claims to be an unbiased scientist) is both a self-proclaimed atheist and homosexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since that time, millions of dollars have poured into finding these genes that take religion and sexuality out of the sphere of moral choice and into the sphere of fate accompli by DNA. Not one shred of evidence supporting these born gay and born irreligious hypotheses have been found. In fact, according to Schwartz, most neuroscientists have given up, since 17,000 genes cannot possible control 1000 trillion brain cell connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Gay activists have picked up the hypothesis and proclaimed it true regardless of the lack of any evidence supporting it. (When, really, do political operatives care a whit about research that does NOT support their political goals? Global warming? Really?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Scripture (Choose you this day Whom you will serve . . .) is directly in line with the most recent discoveries of science (Choosing this thought over that one, this attitude over that one, this action over that one causes brain cells to connect in predictable ways  according to the laws of quantum, not classical, physics  and leave tangible (visible) patterns in the brain. What we choose to become today sets the stage for the reality of what we become tomorrow. And this happens for as long as we live.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The twin study adds physiological evidence to neuroscience. People are religious or not because they choose to be, and this can begin at a very early age (Train up a child in the way he should go . . .). People are attracted to many things. Scripture declares the principle: For a man and a woman shall leave their families and the two shall become one flesh. But even pagan societies set up boundaries of what is appropriate and inappropriate as objects of affection  for the good of the society. These moral standards are wired into the brains of children by observation and teaching.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only with the sexual revolution of the 1960s and then 50 years of stretching the limits have we come to America 2013, where all manner of evil is celebrated as virtue, a place described by the apostle Paul in Romans chapter 1. Except there, what was done was known as depraved, unseemly, and wrong; there, it was not celebrated as virtue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Homosexuals are made, not born, as Spenserr said. Which is why it is so important to the Gay Agenda to get homosexual education into the preschools (two mommies), and elementary health curricula, and adolescent social studies. To champion the rights of Gay children to be who they are without interference from misguided parents. Such training rewires the brains of children to either accept gay behavior as normal and good, or to at least embrace it for others. Gay couples do not produce their own children. They must get them from hetero-sexual unions (its natures way)  either physically or by test-tube.
           </p>
           <p>
            For political activists, science (genes, global warming) is good only when it helps you. Otherwise, it can be ignored as useless and counterproductive.

            I read recently that there have been 8 identical twin studies done in 3 counries (Austr., U.S.A., and Scandinv.) over 20 yrs ALSO proving that homosexuality is not passed through DNA.
