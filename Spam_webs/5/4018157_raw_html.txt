	Place this DHTML script after the &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag and before
	the &lt;BODY&gt; tag.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this DHTML script, there are five links
	that constantly remain in the upper left hand corner.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
	can change these links to meet your own.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Style Sheet 
	has been adjusted to "push" your webpage 120 pixels to the
	right so that the links do not touch any of your text/images.
	You canne adjust this by changing the pixel amount in the BODY

                   On the seventeenth of May, in the Year of our Lord, Sixteen Hundred and Eighty Two, in the tiny village of Nghastell Newydd Bach, which lyes betwixt Hwlffordd and Abergwaun in Sir Benfro, De Orllewin, Cymru (or for ye Englanders, Little Newcastle, in Pembrokeshire, South West, Wales, betwixt Haverfordwest &amp; Fishguard,) a long awaited male child, christened John, was born to George Robert. However twould be not untill my late-thirties that I would come to realize my true worth.

                   On the cusp of my teenage yeeres, I was. A curly, sable haired, boy, with sable eyes. When of age, as me father knew my passion for the sea, I was allowed to sign on as ships boy aboard a merchant ship. Perhaps it was the extraordinary successes of others who had similar passions, to name onely two: Christopher Columbus, Sir Francis Drake, and the more recent atchievements made by William Dampier, and noting, even tho tender in yeeres, the similarities bond us together in thoughts.

                   Come the Year of Our Lord, 1701, is the first real accounting which preyed upon my heart. Autumn was upon us. In the upper pasture of my fathers farm I be setting loose one of my fathers breeding stallions, and a fine looking animal he is. Whilst closing the gate I see my father walking towards me. He is the principal land owner in these parts and tis he, that is to say it be our family who has the honour of being the keepers of the Saint Peters Church.&gt;

      "John," he hollers from across the field, no doubt looking about fer me.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "Here, sir," I reply, whilst waving my right hand high in the air.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      Walking towards me, now being fairly close, his voice mellows. "I have received word," says he, "that the coal shipment has arrivd early in Saint Brides Bay. "Best be a-going with both wagons to Little Haven come early morn. Within one already be the grain order that needes delivering en route."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "Yes, sir," I replied to him.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "Yer eldest brother, William, shall be driving in the second wagon, fer I am not feeling up to the journey this month."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "Yer not ailing are you sir?" Asking in a concerned tone.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "Just tired is all, John." Turning to start walking back to the house. "You and William shall stay with my business associate, as do wee, when in the village. Hes honest, but tis most important a is correct, so ye keep a sharp eye on things."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      Opening the door; allowing my father to enter first, "You canne count upon me, sir," says I, beaming with confidence.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      Morning came quickly and though it is my first time to goe off alone to fetch to the lime and coal alone, meaning without my father along. Having bin there countless times with him, tis great confidence that dwells within me. With Little Haven some twenty miles from my home here in Little Newcastle, the journey will take most of the daye. I knows my brother, William, is excited. Tho onely a few yeeres younger than I, and this shall be his first trip away from home, and such, he eagerly dashes out towards the barn to hitch the teams.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      As I climb up into the wagon my father asks, "Have you the map?"
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "Yes, sir," I assure him, tho his concerns are incidental and worried I am not, for I know the way well.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      Giving me a bit of final advice amid his send off, "Whilst there, there is no need to rush, son. Just relax and take your time."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "I shall do my best fer you, sir."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "I knows you will, John. Keep your eye on William and be sure he doth not get himselfe into trouble."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "I will, sir." Slapping the reins against the rump of the horses I headed out past the church, towards Roch Castle where, William and I shall stop to have our prepared dinner whilst resting the horses.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      Later: Getting on towards six aclock it was, when me and my brother, William, arrivd at the coal yard. Twas here where wed be leaving the wagons, stabling the horses overnight at the livery a ways down the road, in town.
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      Over to me right I saw the proprietor, Mister Greaves. Calling out to him, "Good evening, sir," as I climbed down from the well padded bench seat. By the time me feet hit the ground I was met by one of his hired men. As usual, the young man tooke the reins and led the horses off where he would unhitch the team before stabling them for the night.

      The proprietor, an associate of my fathers, came on over to greet me. "Good to see you, John, but where be your father? I hope he not be ailing."
      <br/>
      <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
      "No, sir. Hes well enough. Just a little tired is all," I said to him. Turning to my brother, who was eager to be introduced, "This sir, is William. The eldest of my three younger brothers."

       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Whilst they spoke briefly, I confess I was not paying much attention to the smale talk betwixt them, fer in the distance I spied a vision of loveliness. A young lady dressed in fine cloathes she was, standing patiently, as a well-bred lady ought behave, next to whom I hoped was her father. Tho I ought not admit it, I could not take my eyes from her. Seeing my attention fixed elsewhere, the associate of my father astutely interrupts my gaze. "A new face in town, John."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       William turned to look, but being much the younger, he didst not share my enthusiasm.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Allow me to introduce you to her, and her father."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Thank you, sir," I said to him, gratefully.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Walking on over I found meselfe mildly nervous. Not from meeting her, of course, but rather that she may already be spoken fer.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Mister Rees," said Mister Greaves as wee stopped before them.  "This be Mister John Robert. His father, George Robert, a Gentleman, ownes a large estate and horse farm in Little Newcastle, nigh on twenty miles North East. And this young man here," patting him on the head, "is his brother, William."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Pleasd to meet you Mister Robert. William," said he.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "And you, sir," I replied giving him a slight bow as I turned my eyes slightly towards his pulchritudinous daughter.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Not being a too prudent in manners as yet, William made his greeting with a bow, but no words. Wishing to be elsewhere; anny place other than where the older sett be talking of things that did not interest him, turned to me and asked, "All right if I look around, John."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "That permission, William, is needed of Mister Greaves, but shouldst be alright with him, you have my leave to go, but keep thyself within ear shot."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Sir?" William said looking at Mister Greaves in earnest.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Go on with ya son," he said, again patting my brother on the head.  "But keep clear of the loading."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Yes, sir," smiling as he dashed off.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Again my attention was fixed upon the young lady, as was noticed by her father. "I should like to present," as he placed the back of his hand beneath her palm, "my daughter, Rebekah," and in the doing, offered her hand.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Slowly I exchanged his hand for mine, and as it ever so lightly it laid atop mine, shivers travelled up my spine. Lowering my head I kissed the white glove which covered her creamy white skin. Then, gently as she spoke, I lett loose of her hand. "A pleasure to meet you, Mister Robert."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       My ears drank in the sound of her gentle voice as my reply came affectionately. "The pleasure is mine, Miss Rebekah."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Though in my seventeenth yeere, I had not, till this daye, mett a girl which I tooke such a fancy. So Sweet and Innocent she looked; well presenting herselfe. A fine school for young ladies she must attend I thought to meselfe.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Whilst their house is made ready, Mister Rees and his daughter are stopping with me also." Mister Greaves information brought me from my daye dream like state to one of forward looking possibilities.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Thats fine!" I said smiling. "Twould be my pleasure to helpe in that regard, sir," said I to her father.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Having much to do before the night came, and regarding me as a suitable escort, being I had bin properly introduced to him by a man of wealth and stature, he made to me a gesture for which I was honoured. "Mister Robert, it would be most helpful if ye would be so kind as to shew my daughter some of the village, and then, if you will, escort her to the residence of Mister Greaves in time for tea."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "An honour, sir." Offering her my forearm, she rested her delicate hand upon my wrist and slowly wee walked off. Twas not untill wee were walking out of the area which presented possible dangers that she carryd her hands before her, whilst mine were held behind my back.

       As wee walked along, engaged in idle conversation, I pointed out to er the different shoppes, naming the proprietors, also telling her a little history of the village. As I talked she listened with great interest. When I said something which amused her I became even more smittened, for her laugh was as gently sweet to me ears as was her smile to my eyes.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       That night at tea, and happily so, she looked my way many times. Twas just a slight smile she had for me, but it was more than enough to capture my thoughts, and together with my heart, she held them in a vice. Earlier, amid our walk, I learnt her father had bin Captain of a Merchant, recently retired. I, in turn, told her of my love of the sea and that already I had served an eight yeere apprenticeship as both a ships boy and a Midshipman in the British Royall Navy.

       The next morn I arose early. Much too early for her to be awake, but beneath her bed chamber door I left for her a note.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       The journey home was the most pleasant of my life fer my thoughts were filled with her alone.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Within a few dayes I sent forth a courier with a message to her father. The letter began with my asking his permission to pay formal court to his daughter. I further explained to him that in a fortnight a new play would be stopping for a few dayes onely and respectively asked his permission to call upon his daughter at that time, with the intention of escorting her thither.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       For many dayes I brooded about, anxious for his reply, when by special messenger came forth the following message.
       <br/>
       <br/>

       Much time has past and my courtship with Miss Rebekah, is now in its ninth month. Onely three months back I asked her father for her hand and it was jovially granted. It was the following daye that war was declared against France. The Grand Alliance be what they call it here, tho I prefer to be calling it by what many of the Seaman coming into port hast dubbed it, "Queen Annes Warr," being tis for a brief spell onely that she, this daughter of that deposed tyrant, James II, hath bin our sovereign, and many be a saying twas for her owne purpose, self-serving as was her father. Her ambitions be for her owne sake and not those of the country, and for this reason alone, this war hath bin thrust upon us.

       This weeke my father, having that wee have had some unusually cold weather, hath decided to send me to Little Haven for an extra wagon of coal. And thus I made an unscheduled trip, and consequently, an unannounced call on my betrothed. When calling upon her at her fathers home, nigh seven of the clock it was, I walked past the open curtains of the parlour, and looking in, as was onely natural, I became disconcerted to see her in the company of a gentleman caller. A seaman he was, an officer, to whom she was sitting entirely too close. Prudently, moving backwards, I stepped sevrall steps away from the window in the direction I had just come. Standing still for a few moments I could onely conclude that some innocent reason must exist I was as yet unaware of. But wrestle with my thoughts I did, fer twas not onely that they be unchaperoned, but they sat abreast; even tho there was plenty of room on the settee, as well as sevrall other chairs about the room. Notwithstanding, I decided, as I stood motionless, to give to her the benefit of the doubt and went off instead to the home of my fathers business associate, Mister Greaves, where I would bunk fer the night.

       After everyone had turned in for the evening I decidd to pay a the local tavern call. I not be one for drinking, but twas here that I felt that perhaps I might learn who the man was. The moment I entered I saw sevrall men at the bar and twas there I went in search of information. Not knowing anny of them present I joined em; ordering for meselfe an Ale. Being they be more or less likely gutter trash, I listened, for it be them who always knows the town dirt. After hearing the conversations that abounded throughout and noting that each of em included talk about the villages women folk, I made my owne comment. "I hear that Reess daughter is getting married soon to a wealthy planters son, yet onely moments ago I saw her walking out with a Naval Officer."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Aye." replied one of the men, "The lass fancies sailors as well, This Ive seene with me owne eyes.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "But which of em shall it be?" Chuckling a third man as he lifted his glass.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "That it seemes she canne not be deciding," spoke another man.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Too true," the first man said taking a drinke. "She seemes to fancy, not onely those which be heirs to property, but them who those who brave the sea as well."
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       "Aye," said the second man, speaking once more, obviously in his cups. "Perhaps its her aim to marry rich onely to be able to be entertain whilst she gathers fer herselfe a following of seaman to fill her bed, being this rich mans son shes to wed is too much of a gentleman to bed the willing wench before hes lawfully entitled."
       <br/>

       Tho thoroughly abashed, I did my best not to show it. However, stay longer I could not, for that last remark gave me cause to leave forthwith. Stormed I did, a the way back to my lodgings onely to retire for the night, tho well I did not sleep.

       Rising early, I left Little Haven early the next morn, neer  again to speake to she who hath betrayed me, and in so, I decide to reenlist into the Royall Navy and forever live my life as a man of the sea, neer  again to expose my selfe to the treacheries of the heart.

     Whilst the Warr raged on, I became a highly proficient seaman, navigator and handler of men, belieeving the latter was atchieved, not thro strict deportment, but appeasement. Neertheless, when the war ended, despite being an invaluable member of the crew, I, now 31, find meselfe jobless, just as were thousands of those who earned their living upon the sea.

     Life on land was as harsh as ever and work on both land and sea was scarce. As a result a great deal of men felt they had no choice, but piracy, if they were going to survive after the war ended. As it turned out, many of those who Had found work as honest seamen, found them selfes turning to piracy at the first available opportunity as a means to escape the harsh treatment and meagre rations so prevalent among both Naval and Merchant vessells.

Subsequently, not being able to resolve their differences, the pyrates broke ranks. Of the combined crews the majority sailed with

     Unbeknownst to them who waited upon the merchant ships, they were about to be besieged by none other than the well knowne Welsh pyrate,
     <a href="http://www.bartholomewroberts.com/davies.htm">
      <u>

     <i>
      Royall James
     </i>
     , had, no more than a month earlier, captured the Dutch Interloper,
     <i>
      Marquis del Campo
     </i>
     , off Cape Three Points Bay. The engagement was fervent, lasting from two bells that afternoon, unto the third ringing of two bells the next morn, as each crew member gave their all untill the Dutch Captain, who being regrettably unable to continue the fight, struck his colours. And a faire prize she was to be sure.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     The
     <i>
      Marquis del Campo
     </i>
     , was an impressive square rigged Sloop, carrying a crew of ninety, Proud seaman they be, proud of their Captain, their ship and of the thirty cannon she carried. All of which gave them a sense of security. Among her many attributes was a magnificent great cabin, located just below the high poop deck. It alone was enough to breathe aspirations into anny Captain worthy of his salt and that be not all, for her three masts be tall and stout; her construction throughout, solidly built. Lastly and most importantly she was yare.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     As was customary aboard pyrate vessells, all unneed'd bulkheads within the mighty Sloop be promptly removed as she was outfitted for their purposes, and moreover, even tho she be armed to the teeth,

     ordered still more cannon be mounted untill she boast'd not onely thirty-two, 8 pound cannon upon carriages, but twenty-seven swivels upon her railing, making her as formidable as anny Naval Frigate. Newly fit and ready to serve, twas time it was that a new name be given to their captured prize and what was decided upon was, the

     Immediately, without hesitation, those having temporary power of command at that point in time, whilst a couple of the Captains of the merchant ships be ashore conducting business, knew they could expect a heated engagement and undoubtedly loss of life among their crews.

Affrightened, the Hollander immediately struck his colours and calld for quarter, which was granted, as it is among the majority of pyrate vessells, tho such granting is specifically outlined within the articles belonging to

     , attempt to force nor sway me, but has rather opened my eyes to the Mundane way of life that hath besieged me and the Despotic relationship existing betwixt the Common man and his Oppressors, otherwise knowne as the Degenerate Aristocracy, who, in possessing wealth and social position, use their high and mighty status to increase their owne selfes whilst trampling upon those, who, without recourse, labour reluctantly, to maintain them in their exalted rank.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     During the course of these profound conversations I learn much about their  democratic society. Tis altogether different than the dictatorship aboard found a Naval vessell, or that of a Merchant and the arrogant Masters who commanded them.
     <br/>

     During this time, however much I be softening to that which Id bin for the whole of me life repulsed by, belieeving not onely piracy, but all forms of thievery to be a moral a sin, I am not an active member of this crew, but even so, when I see that which I feel needes correction or when I canne be giving assistance to those who request my helpe, I have and shall continue for it be my way.

      <u>

     and his crew, Lords and Commoners, as they consider them selfes, have complemented me on my adeptness as both a seaman and mariner. Some, especially them of high regard, have commended my natural leadership abilities. In regards to these thoughts,tis me pleasure to write herein that I was offered, this daye, the placement of Quarter-Master on board the
     <i>
      Royall James
     </i>
     . However, not yet keen to the idea of officially joining their ranks, whilst at the same time wishing not to insult those who think so well of me, I graciously refusd.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     Their placement, in what is their owne private commonwealth aboard ship, is one of commanding interest, especially being this here vessell wee be aboard be a pyrate ship. Their officers, being knowne as 
     <i>
      their
     </i>
     , House of Lords, is conducted with the utmost respect, referring to one another as, My Fellow Noble, and to each other as, My Noble Lord, whilst addressment by the commoners, those who make up the balance of the crew, is by Milord or rank

     .
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     These thoughts plagued me and after much deliberation and soul searching I came to the conclusion, despite the loathing I have for their incessant drinking, reprehensible language and deplorable lack of propriety, that thenceforth I shall be a willing member of the company. And to those who enquire as to my reasons; I state thus:
     <i>
      <font color="red" face="Arial" size="3">
       "It is to get rid of the disagreeable superiority of some masters peregrinations had accustomed me and the Love of Novelty and Change

      </sup>
     </font>
     ," and to be knowne here and thereafter as Bartholomew Roberts.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     For them who question my choice, as tis belieeved by some that my chosen Christian name be taken from the Bartholomew Faire in Bristol; even tho the most obvious choice, which seemes to elude them, would be to state that Bartholomew is my second name. Wheras, for reasons of my owne, neither of these shall I confirm nor deny. Instead I shall make reference onely that I desire the truth of me feelings not be knowne. Ergo, I shall say simply that there be just Too many Johns about and tis my ambition to be sett apart from withal.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     These here pyrates be not at a as I had pictured them to be. Instead I find em, for the most part, to be men of honour, whose word, once given, is a bond that canne be trusted. They, the whole lot, despite their ceaseless efforts to remain in their cups, function as a brotherhood for the betterment of a and their ship is their country. Another noteworthy aspect which is again in contrary to that of a Naval vessell or Merchant, which serves onely for the personall gain, both in wealth and social position, for not onely ts commander, but, and even more so, to them he serves in loyalty, who be generally them land lubbers whose high borne reap the benefits from those who toil, whilst atchieving no benefits of their labours.

Having no choice, the Frenchie, remaining within hailing distance, drops her anchor. Tho smale, she would be of use, replacing the

     was not onely our Captain, but to me personally, an inspirational friend whom I held as a brother. As it is, tho it greatly pains me, I knows tis a necessity that wee, who be anchored beneath the harbours twelve gunns, depart in due haste, as I says to em, "Wee be in grave danger. First wee must escape this harbour, for it is death she holds for us a. Once out of harms way, then canne our plans be made."
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     Rallying the men, my advice is heeded, but alas more ills serge upon us, for the winds doth not favour us. To ensure our survival, I excersize the command entrusted to me by my murdered Captain, and altho not spoken with conceit, tis by virtue of my adroitness, that the necessary speed is made in getting our great ship under saile, and, despite the heavy gale, the crew works feverously under my direction, tacking us out of the harbour.
     <br/>

     Tis not too long before our

     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     Free from danger, plans canne commence. First however, as the perplexity of ensuing chaos arises, one member of the company points out a necessity, saying:
     <font color="red" face="Arial" size="3">
      <i>
       "The good of the whole, and the maintenance of order, demands a head, but the proper authority be deposited in the community at large; so that if one should be elected who did not act and govern for the general good, he could be deposed, and another be substituted in his placesup&gt;

     Having had his fill of their debate, our master gunner, Lord Henry Dennis, rises and makes a memorable speech:

      <i>
       "It is not of anny great Significance who is dignifyd with Title of Commander; for really and in Truth, a good Governments have, like ours, the supreame Power lodged with the Community, who might doubtless revoke and depute authority as suited Interest or Humour. Wee are the original holders of this claim and should a Captain be so sawcy as to exceed Prescription at anny time, why down with him! It will be a caution after he is dead to his Successors, of what fatal Consequence anny sort of assuming may be. However, it is my Advice, that, whilst wee are sober, wee pitch upon a Man of Courage, and skilld in Navigation, one, who by his Council and Bravery seemes best able to defend this Commonwealth, and ward us from the Dangers and Tempests of an unstable Element, the sea, and the fatal Consequences of Anarchy; and such a one I take Roberts to be.

     Amid the rejoicing feelings so prevalent within my heart, I stand and accept the honour afforded me, saying,

     After a spell the vote is taken and our new government is settled. Captain Davies good nature and affability gained him much respect, creating a unanimous concord. After a brief discussion a concordat to avenge not onely his murder, but those of our Mates is decided. Nigh on a weeke hath past since that fateful daye and wee now be en route to the Isle of Princes, determined to avenge our loss.

     , is knowne also for his boldness and daring. Having bin ashore sevrall times, his placement as Quarter-Master and familiarity with the terrain, he suggests the best course of action is to venture overland, attacking the forts rear flank. My better judgment goes against his proposed expedition and instead I devise a strategy for a frontal assault. After deskribing me plans of having Lord Kennedy lead a ground assault; going ashore with thirty men whilst I command the seaside attack with cannon from aboard ship. The crew, tho ready for action, have reservations. I tells em that such a shew of daring will implant such awe within their hearts that the soldiers and townspeople will flee.
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     Tho unsure at first, I was, after careful explanation, able to impress upon my company the logic of my proposal and such being the case, me plans for our line of attack be readily accepted.

     Once making land fall, displaying tremendous fortitude and courage, off they marchd; up the steep embankment, directly towards the harbour gunn emplacements, fearlessly trudging beneath the bombardment of our gunns.

     Looking thro the spyglass, the Portugueze, once discovering our shore party, fired into their ranks and, just as I had predicted, the Portugueze, seeing their gunns had no effect, quitted their posts and fled towards the sheltered town, wherupon

     and his men marchd onward without opposition. Even at such a distance, knowing the mens disposition, I could see, as well as feel, both their fury and sense of satisfaction as they heave the heavy cannon over the ridge, sending them tumbling down the cliff and into the sea below. After the completion of their task they sett the fort ablaze whilst displaying some merriment before quietly and quickly making their way back to the ship without casualty

     nor that of our mates. The majority of the company be for burning the town, which agreeably I will yield to, should anny means be proposed that shant bring forth our owne destruction. Pointing out that the town has a securer situation than the fort, having a thick wood coming almost upon it, affording cover to the occupants, who, under such an advantage, I tell them, is a thing to be affrighted and once again I suggest to me crew a veary different plan of action, stating: "Would fire stand better than cannon? Besides, the burning of bare houses would yield a thin reward for our trouble and loss."
     <br/>
     <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
     Altho my prudent advice prevails, I think against using, the Rover, as the water being shoal, she is not fitting for our purpose. "However," I explain; "Within our possession still, wee have the French ship. She is shallow of draft and I suggest that wheron, will she not better suit our purpose?"
     <br/>

     The Lords and Commoners concurring, lightn the vessell that shall do our bidding; fitting her with cannon untill she numbers twelve and towing even more that be lashed upon rafts, positioning them thus that they float nigh as possible to the beach.

     Once ready, those of us who shall be aboard er, meselfe commanding the assult, run the French ship along the shore, therewith wee thoroughly and well shell the town, and in doing so, batter down many of yon outlying houses; after which, return to our Sloope, and having no further use for it, abandon the French ship.

       Come morn, wee capture a Portugueze trade ship bearing little cargo, and two dayes more, whilst sailing westward, wee fell upon the Temperance, commandd by one Captain Sharman. Well supplyd in pot, pans and metalware she is; a cargo intendd, tho unsuccessfully, to trade for slaves, shall serve us well. Furthermore, being she is a fine ship, I shall keep her. Not wanting to deprive her former Captain, being he was most co-operative in nature, it was to gave him, the Portugueze craft still within our possession

       Steering for So Tom wee meet with no ships and thus continue on untill reaching the Isle of Annobn, where wee anchor. Tis here wee water and provision the ship and upon gathering for council, put to a vote the sailing to either Brazil or the East Indies. The company, by majority vote, resolve to saile forth to Brazil. The journey, a distance of some twenty-seven hundred nautical miles, takes us onely a span of twenty-eight dayes, wherby wee arrive by design to the tiny, uninhabited island of Fernando de Noronha, which lyes about one hundred twenty-five miles off the Easternmost tip of Brazil.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       The speed and accuracy of this sailing, tho not out of my ordinary endeavours, forever imprints my much talked bout navigational skills, not onely instilling a goodly amount of well deserved confidence into the hearts and minds of me crew, but also within the annuls of history, for such skills be of a sort which gives birth to legendary proficiency.

Once beached, me ship is lightned. Her cannon, stores, water casks and other heavy cargo is placd on shore and her top masts removed. With ropes and pulleys attached to her lower masts, and the usage of stout timber in the woodland, the
       <i>
        Rover

       is heeled over onto her side, to lay upon the beach whilst the work is done. By night fall, being wee shall reside upon land during the cleaning, tents are sett up along the shore. Come morn, Lord Main, the companies chosen Boatswain, issues assignments, as this is among his responsibilities.

       One crew scrapes her hull thoroughly of the infectious Marine life and weeds, whilst the ships carpenters follow closely behind making anny needd repairs. Lastly, me ship is caulked, wherby, upon her hull, a mixture of me owne recipe consisting of Red Lead, Sulphur and Tallow is generously applyd

       . Such a mixture not onely deters encrustations, but helpes her to better slip thro the water, adding speed whilst also giving her an Impressive as well as Fearsome appearance. Once complete the entire process is repeated, wherupon the opposite side of her hull receives the same start to finish treatment.

       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Amid this work there are many crewmen who be assigned the tasks of filling the water casks; and still others who gather the provisions. After working laboriously for one weeke and a halfe more, a tasks being complete, wee be ready for our South American cruise.

       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       Sailing on the ebb tide wee cruise on the cusp of the horizon, just beyond lands sight, but for a period of nigh on nine weekes, wee, to our dismay, sight not a single saile. Me crew, as am I, disillusioned by these empty waters, belieeve it best to depart and upon the vote of me company wee sett saile for the West Indies.

       Tis September of 1719/20 and with the intention of watering and provisioning our ship for the long saile, I make course for Bahia de los Santos.&amp;nbsp By dusk wee be steering into the harbour, where, to my delight, I espy a fleet of heavily laden Merchant ships, as does me crew, altho their reaction be of considerable difference to that of mine.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       This be quite a situation and in an effort to heave to, wee luff the Rovers sailes.&amp;nbsp Tho a series of intense discussions be taking place about the ship, the consensus is the same; me crew thinks to wait untill full dark, for upon this night there will be no moon and tis their hope that under the cover of darkness, they canne slip away unnoticed. My thoughts however, be of a different sort.
       <br/>
       <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
       The affluent presence of saile here explains to me the lack of such these past two months and more.&amp;nbsp Here, anchored before me, almost in my grasp, is gathered the treasure fleet of the Portugueze and I be a-knowing that it be these here ships which shall afford us our fortune, for they are sure to contayne a yeeres quantity of riches and a hearty amount of much needd supplies and necessities; a of which I surmise to be in good assortment, and it be most sure I am that such canne be found upon the richest ship in the fleet.

       Nine weekes is a long stint for a pyrate vessell to saile without reward.&amp;nbsp However I find my selfe to be greatly pleasd, for in a remarkably short time I have impressed upon my capable, yet rowdy company, a great deal; rapidly turning them into a well-greased attack force.&amp;nbsp Altho their manners and moral conduct hast not changed, their courage is beyond compare, and in time I knows their seamanship abilities shall be without peers.&amp;nbsp Of late however, despite the rigorous training, tis increasingly restless I sees them becoming and thus I knows I neede to restore within them uncompromising thoughts of my abilities even tho much of which be considered by them are as in omens.&amp;nbsp But however superstitious the average seaman may be, a Captain,

       when blessed with a measure of good luck within his repertoire as I be; is revered. My luck of course, not subskribing to superstition, is not onely to be proficiently skilld in navigation and seamanship, but also in possession of a healthy supply of unrelenting audaciousness. Altho here and now, the flotilla within my view is indeed, just the good fortune Ive bin needin, and I knows tis not by luck that wee shall prevail and see me plans thro, but vigilance, skill and cunning.

          Dear Visitor,

          <br/>
          <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
          This website has been online since 1997. Whilst concurrently writing the Memoirs for the Great Pyrate Roberts, as channelled to me and that has been, I have continually worked to improve it, an effort which has always shall be my esteem pleasure. Since these writings began, 75% of which I have gathered has been placed here for the benefit, for not only you, the reader, but for Captain Roberts. Because the book now finished, published and available for purchase, I have removed the majority of this site. That which remains  above, is the first 15% of those writings.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <img height="8" src="Cap'nRoberts_space.gif" width="25"/>
          For some 280 years, this great man's story has been told incorrectly, save Aubrey Burl, who did a superb job, but alas, 99% of the remaining tellings, are far from accurate. For those who are interested, many of those grave errors are mentioned within the bibliography, less my feelings towards Terry Breverton, whose book created such wrath within my soul only minutes of opening the first, I did not bother even to make mention of his two books beyond there existence. I believe it's because of these ill told accounts, that Captain Roberts has channelled his story through me because he wishes his true &amp; complete story told in his own words, and thus presented said in first person. You may wonder, as did I, why he choose me, but after a spell I not only understood but was, &amp; always shall be greatly honoured. I do hope that everyone will wish to read the entire Grand Adventure of this Great Man. For those who would be interested in a fictional story surrounding Captain Roberts I do hope you will consider "BLOOD &amp; SWASH," soon to be released through iUniverse publishing house (&amp; an elabroate interactive edition (limited to 100 copies,) which includes the addition of a love interest that entwines throughout his entire piratical life. The novel, &amp; that's not really the correct term, being it too is ALL true, does not change one word of the true story but rather encompasses his memoirs and can be completely removed without disturbing history. Captain Roberts is responsible for all that I have written, &amp; never would I do him less than justice.
