         Does Jesus look like what most pictures of Him reveal? Did Jesus have long hair and wear a white robe as the pictures and movies portray? Did He look different from the rest of the Jews or was He no different from those of His day?

         I believe that we will be shocked on the day that we see Jesus Christ. Hopefully you will see Him on the day of His return as your Savior and not as your Judge, but well discuss that later but right now we are

          asking if Jesus had long hair
         </a>
         . The Bible is silent on the length of His hair but there is no reason to believe that He had the long, flowing locks of hair that the movies portrayed Him as having or the thousands of pictures that display Him with long hair. Jews of the day never wore their hair long. In fact Paul knew that it was customarily a shame for a man to have long hair (1 Cor 11:14) and knowing that Jesus was a carpenter, having long hair would have gotten in the way of His work.

          Jesus: A Mans Man
         </span>
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         Jesus was not the effeminate looking man that most images reveal Him as. He was a carpenter and carpenters in those days not only worked with wood, they worked with stones. They had no power tools of course so the wood had to be cut by using hand tools and great physical labor which must have took long, tedious hours to work with. The wood was not like what we see today; two by fours or four by sixes. They worked with large timbers of roughhewn wood. These timbers had to be cut down by hand and they had to be sawed down into workable sections. They had to be debarked and sanded. And carpenters in those days worked with stone more than they did wooden beams. And these stones were just not simple stepping stones or mortar bricks but more like boulders and these boulders had to be chiseled and cut down to size. Every bit of the carpenters work was extremely labor intensive and so we should realize that Jesus had to have been a big, strong man with great physical strength, yet He kept this strength under control in what is a good description of meekness: Strength under control. So we see that Jesus was a mans man and may have had the body of a heavy construction worker. He must have been an imposing physical specimen.

          Did He Look Different from Fellow Jews?
         </span>
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         Time and time again, the New Testament records that Jesus slipped away into the crowds and that the religious officials, when looking for Him, frequently couldnt find Him? Why was this so? Because Jesus must have looked much like any other rabbi of the day with a robe yes, but not with the long hair that we think He wore. There are dozens of accounts where Jesus simply slipped away and blended into the crowds:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <span style="color: #800000;">
           John 5:13 Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <span style="color: #800000;">
           Luke 4:30 but he slipped away through the crowd and left them.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <span style="color: #800000;">
           John 7:11 The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, Where is he?
          </span>
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <span style="color: #800000;">
           John 11:56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?
          </span>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">

         <a class="ext-link" data-wpel-target="_blank" href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2010/07/09/what-did-jesus-look-like/" rel="external nofollow" title="">
          Jesus
         </a>
         had a long, white flowing robe and He had long hair, He would have been easy to spot, since historical accounts show that the Jews in Jesus day had short hair. He likely had a beard but so did many of the Jewish men in that day. There is every indication that Jesus was hard to pick out of a crowd but when He wanted to be seen, He was able to make Himself visible.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: justify;">
         <span style="color: #000080;">
          Not Much to Look At
         </span>
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         Isaiah described Jesus as looking like an ordinary man and that there nothing special in His appearance that would make Him stand out. Isaiah described Him in 53: 2b
         <span style="color: #000080;">
          he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,and no beauty that we should desire him.
         </span>
         He wouldnt fit in well with the prosperity preachers on TV. He wouldnt make a popular itinerant preacher today. He wouldnt be getting millions of hits on YouTube. This is because Jesus was not especially handsome and there was nothing special in His appearance that would make Him stand out which matches with the many New Testament references of Him easily slipping through the crowds. He was not desirous to look upon nor had no beauty (in the Jewish vernacular this means that He wasnt handsome). Jesus humanity made Him out to be no different looking than any other man of the day. Otherwise, we really dont know what Jesus looked like other than He was an ordinary looking man, that He was strong and extremely physically fit and that He was able to blend in with the crowds very easily. The Bible is silent on exactly what He looked like and if the Bible is silent on His exact appearance, then God apparently doesnt think its important for us to know.

          Conclusion
         </span>
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         We do know exactly what Jesus looks likeat least today. Here is the only appearance of Jesus that anyone needs to know for sure and since its revealed in the Bible, God did think this was important enough for us to know. John describes Jesus and when he saw Him he fell down on his face as a dead man as we read in Revelation 1:13-18:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <span style="color: #800000;">
           in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.
           <sup>
           </sup>
           The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire,
           <sup>
            his
           </sup>
           feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters.
           <sup>
           </sup>
           In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, Fear not, I am the first and the last,
           <sup>
           </sup>
           and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.
          </span>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         That is what Jesus looks like today. If you have failed to repent, there is still time but if you dont, He will appear to you as described above but He will be your Judge and it will not go well with your soul (Rev 20:11-15) but if He is your Savior today, your future is so amazing that I cant even describe it. Everyone will see Jesus someday and will know exactly what He looks like. It doesnt matter what He looked like on earth but it will matter for all eternity what He looks like now. Today, He is your Judge or He is your Savior. Its your choice.

               Actually BECAUSE it was written in the Bible, makes it a fact. The words therein, are words written by men, yes; however, they were instructed yo write them by God. God is all knowing, so using the argument that men are fallible and may have written their own thing regardless of what God wanted wouldnt apply here because God being that he was, is, and always will be all knowing meant he chose scribes he knew wouldnt change a word that he instructed them to write. Its a neat modern day argument, but Im sorry, it doesnt hold water.

                 Wow. So everything that is written in the Bible is fact? Thats a very simple world view point that you have and a lovely circular argument that will keep you save in your ignorant mindset. God is not all knowing because God, and all the Gods before and after, are creations of the human mind. Regardless, I am honestly interested, do you actually believe and follow everything that you read in the Bible without question? Subject: Re: New comment posted on What Did Jesus Really Look Like?

                   Yes everything in the Bible is a fact.  If it wasnt, why do we base our life on it.  And yes, my family and many others that I know are living by the Bible and doing what it says in its pages, no pork or other animals that are not allowed, we keep the Sabbath (Saturday), we dont keep pagan holidays (Easter, Christmas), we keep the feast days, no tattoos or piercings,  and we follow ever word that we can to the best of our understanding.  Most people say they follow the Bible and love Christ and yet they wont do as they are asked to do to go to the Kingdom, because they are comfortable in the life they know and expect him to save them.  You cannot go against the rules and expect a reward at the end.

                     Hi Kim, your conviction is refreshing. There are too many false cafeteria Christians who only want to follow the Lords rules that suit them. But, just because you base your life on the Bible does not make the content fact. Your statement
                     <br/>
                     Yes everything in the Bible is a fact. If it wasnt, why do we base our life on it is circular reasoning and does not prove the validity of anything in the Bible. The same line of reasoning can be used by a follower of the Koran, the bhagavad gita  or the Torah, but does that make their book any more true than the Bible? Just because they follow their particular book and base their life around it, does that make their book fact? The answer is no. Just because people follow a book and believe it to be true does not make the contents within it fact.

                     actually, as a christian, I must disagree with everything you said.everything you do is understood to be the law of Moses.we are no longer under the law of Moses.  We are now under the law of Grace.  Jesus came and fulfilled the law and shed his blood as the ULTIMATE sacrifice.  We can now eat pork if we want, &amp; celebrate holidays if we want.  Paul says, everything is permissable, but everything is not beneficial.  So its up to you to decide what you will eat and what holidays you will celebrate.  Romans says those who only eat vegetables are weak in their faith.  Its because they are still trying to follow the laws that Jesus came and fulfilled already.

                     Conveniently, the Romans (and the rest of us heathens) can now eat pork, though God had forbidden it for thousands of years.

                     Oh, and we can dispense with circumcision as an unnecessary inconvenience, even though God supposedly said it was a perpetual sign between himself and his people, words to that effect.

                     MrsDomJones, You do greatly ERRED from the TRUTH.
                     <br/>
                     Eating Vegetables do not make you weak in the Faith, but it does make you strong and wise in your body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Eating Pork on the other hand makes you weak in the flesh and eventually you get a BRAND NEW TOMBSTONE Early before Christmas. (Pun intended, because we do not Observe the ways of the Heathens like Christmas, Easter, Halloween, 4th of July, Columbus Day, Thank Giving Day for killing off the native Americans you get the point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     JEREMIAH 10:2-4
                     <br/>
                     2. Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
                     <br/>
                     3. For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe).
                     <br/>
                     4. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. CHRISTMAS is Idolatry and VAIN.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now to GRACE:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You said that we are now under GRACE as if that is a License to keep on Sinning and Breaking Gods Law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You see PAUL was an expert of the Law of Moses because he was a Pharisee a Doctor of the LAW.
                     <br/>
                     Christians can never understand Pauls writings because they do not understand the Old Testament. That is why they always misunderstood what Paul is actually saying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     2 PETER 3:15-16
                     <br/>
                     15. And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother PAUL also according to the WISDOM given unto him hath WRITTEN unto you;
                     <br/>
                     16. as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things HARD to be UNDERSTOOD, which the IGNORANT and UNSTEDFAST wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own DESTRUCTION.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     ROMANS 6:1-2
                     <br/>
                     1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
                     <br/>
                     2. God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When You get a CREDIT CARD Bill and you see a GRACE PERIOD to pay it off before the Penalty kicks in. Do you actually throw it in the trash and say I can now Charge my credit card without Paying the Cost?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     No, the Credit card company will shut off your spending privilege and charge you some hefty late fee and high Interest where you will have to pay it all off in the END.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Same thing occurs with the Grace in Christ.
                     <br/>
                     Under the Old covenant if a Man commit an Adultery, Him and the Woman would be Stone to DEATH because for that Sin there is no animal sacrifice but his and her BLOOD is required of them. There were many laws if broken under the Old Covenant the Priest have no sacrifice to forgive them, but their own blood would be the sacrifice for their sin by stoning them to DEATH.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Under the NEW Covenant there is GRACE where the Sinner this time will not get STONE to Death because Christ Blood has given him TIME or GRACE to REPENT and be Converted to RIGHTEOUSNESS thereby avoiding the PENALTY OF SIN which is DEATH by Stoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Romans 6:23
                     <br/>
                     23. For the WAGES of SIN is DEATH; but the gift [GRACE] of God is eternal life through [REPENTANCE IN] Jesus Christ our Lord.

                     I bet you think Orgies, homosexuality, Fornications, Murder, Thieves, Lying is ok, as long as its in the Name of Jesus, since you say he done away with the law, when He blatantly said he did not come to do so. That is why Christianity is the biggest Whore house giving Legal  and Illegal Prostitute Houses a run for their money.

                     The Pastors are already PIMPS because you bring your money to him so he can ride around in bentleys and porches and have sex with little boys and married women.  There is no where in the bible that ask for money as Tithing. What a HOAX!

                     Keep eating Pork and see if God will answer your prayer when you are in the Hospital getting surgery for Heart Problems and other diseases caused by eating unclean and filthy meat as Swine or Pigs. God will Mock you in your calamity.

                    <p>
                     Your Church Members cant Pray for you, because they are breaking Gods Laws left and right in the Churches by not keeping his Commandments because they ignorantly believe its done away with.

                     9. Then was FULFILLED that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     John 15:25
                     <br/>
                     25. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be FULFILLED that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     John 17:12
                     <br/>
                     12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be FULFILLED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     These are the prophesies he said he so FULFILLED and the Only Law he has done away with is the Animal Sacrifice through his own blood we no longer need to bring lambs and goats for sacrifice. That Sacrificial Law was Nailed to the Tree or Stake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     BUT THE LAW, STATUES and COMMANDMENTS still STANDS FOREVER!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Matthew 5:18
                     <br/>
                     18. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Question: Is heaven and earth still here? Then the LAW, Statues and Commandments are still in EFFECT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Christ did not FULFILLED: Homosexuality, Fornication, Murder, Breaking the Sabbath, Lying, Stealing, Eating PORK or SWINE, all these things are breaking Gods LAW, STATUES and COMMANDMENTS. Christ is not a LAW BREAKER that is BLASPHEMY!

                     Kim Hollands remark is a clear example of how modern Christians do pick and choose, we all pick and choose which scriptures to buy into. Kim rightly says that the bible proscribes pork. Mrs.Dom Jones says, As a Christian, I must disagree with everything you said.

                     Almost no-one in modern evangelical community incorporates all elements of the bible into their worldview, because doing so would introduce too many irreconcilable conflicts.

                 The truth will set you free. The bible, on the other hand, just may confuse you. For example, and I quote another source but it is so obvious and you can check out the details yourself in the bible: Lukes account of the death of Judas in Acts 1:18 is scarcely reconcilable with Matt 27:3-10. They contradict each other, which would be normal if two people, writing some 30-50 years later would get the details confused. This does not square with the notion of a perfect god writing a perfect bible though. And this is only one of dozens of examples in the New Testament.

                   Why cant both be true? I believe that both statements record truth about the death of Judas/Yehuda (yes he hanged himself, yes he fell headfirst and yes his body burst and his intestines spilled out, in that order) but it is also true that the words of the Scriptures as first and originally written were in fact the words of God, but to say that that is 100% true now in all of the translations is not accurate. It was the God-breathed, spoken and recorded word of God in the original texts.But until you receive Yeshua as the Son of God as is clearly set forth throughout the entire bible, both the Tanakh and the Brit Hadasha, you will have trouble with understanding all of the Scriptures.

             Perhaps if You step back &amp; consider the vow of the Nazarite, You know, no drinking or partaking of the fruit of the vine no hair cutting Ya think Jesus also being from Nazareth could be a clue as to that?

                 True, NickRepublic. And one thing that has puzzled me is, what were these locusts that the baptist ate? I have read that they were a kind of berry. I dont know what kind of locust trees they had, but the black locusts that we have in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington (and which I think were imported from Russia) are supposed to have poisonous berries. So I am still wondering, what was it that he ate?

                   Locusts were insects in the Bible. They were similar to grasshoppers. He ate insects and honey.

                     Dear Guest: If that is the case, that he was eating insects, locusts, and honey, well the honey part is okay maybe but the locusts present a problem if they are saying that John the Baptist was a Nazarite. Even if he were not a Nazarite, I think it presents a problem, because Jews were commanded not to eat things that crawled around on their bellies, things that creep or crawl on their bellies as grasshoppers surely do. If you have evidence otherwise, please let me know. Thanks.

                     I thought he was allowed to in order to sustain to do His Holy work? I am still trying to understand who my Father is, and fill myself everyday, not just once with His Holy Spirit. I recently converted because of an event.

                     I am a scientist who saw things that should not be in what we know as a physical realm, and they were NOT as we are. They were malevolent, and I was horrified. I did what I never did before. I went to the top, the MOST HIGH instead of man and asked for guidance and help, and I dont know how long I was out, but I saw things that makes more sense than any scientific discipline.
                     <br/>
                     Beware because the devil has many shapes, hes very persistent, and he can will us to see and do things that dont make sense you at all. That separation from the Lord Almighty is real. If the antithesis was the Way and the Word, and the Message, then do you think Hes hedonistic, and all that is worldly??

               Also, Theophile, I have seen claims that Jesus was a vegetarian. Maybe he was, but if so, why did he prepare a meal of barbecued fish for the disciples, as recorded? However, the picture that we have of Christ may actually be a composite. I think a lot of stories circulated about him, some of which hit a nerve with people of the first century, and thus became popular. Later, they of course had to pass the test of Roman censorship.

               Jesus also celebrated the Passover, which was a meal with lamb, which is something that the Hebrew peoples were told to celebrate in remembrance of the death angel passing over and NOT killing their 1st born, and for helping them to cross over the Red Sea. Jesus then became our Passover Lamb!

               Its not the ravings of an idiot: It is a type of literature, a genre of literature that was common to the era, particularly among the Jews, and it was, really, a work of art. It certainly was not meant to be taken as a prophecy of things that would happen 2,000 years later. Readers of that time, no doubt understood that this was not literally a dream even. The apocalyptic dream-like stories were fiction designed to propose explanations of Gods divine plan in mysterious and highly metaphorical language. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of the company. : )

                 So true sir.  If the Book of Revelation is the ravings of an idiot, and I do not  believe it is, then they are calling the author of this book by the same name and that is Jesus Christ Himself, since it is HIS revelation and not Johns at all.

                  <p>
                   Jack, I am wondering how you can know this book is properly understood as HIS revelation, other than by the fact that it makes this claim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You are no doubt aware that the Book of Revelation was excluded from the cannon for hundreds of years, until after Augustine wrote The City of God or around then. At least, this has been my understanding. Is that incorrect?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is my understanding that the church finally admitted the book based upon the possibility that it could be interpreted as allegories, metaphors and such, not literally. So the church has had a problem with the book all along, and only accepted it once it was interpreted other than literally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now we have a movement that wants to try to make it literal again, just exactly what the church tried to discourage in the first place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What we tend to forget about the book, is that it is literature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The type of literature known as apocalypse followed certain rules and patterns, and there are a number of examples apparently, in Jewish writings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Again, an apocalypse, as I understand it, is semi-fictitious literature to promote a certain religious point of view. Taken literally, the pov of Revelation was considered by the church for the first several hundred years to be inconsistent with the gospels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If we are going to call it the Word of God, we must at least do so with that kind of understanding of the book.

             If Jesus was a Nazarite, then why did He turn water into wine and had wine at the Passover meals?  I thought that the Nazarite vows would prohibit that.  Thanks Theophile.

               He was of Nazareth, a city, not a Nazarite. That was Samson. Nowhere in Scripture does it ever say Jesus was a Nazarite or took the Nazarite vow.

               I am with you on that issue, Jack. Either he was not a Nazarite, or else people had fogotten what the vows of the Nazarites were, which is not likely.

                 Spot on Martin.  Thanks, I agree and never said Jesus was a NazariteHe was a Nazarene and really and it was written When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, Who is this? And the crowds said,This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee (Matt 21:10-11).

             Jesus looked like Troy Polamalu bronze skin and wooly hair, a Semitic Jew.  The Rev. 1:13-18 passage refers to the transformed Jesus with the white hair not the one who walked the earth.

               he said that the jews of that time didnt wear their hair long. and if its wooly hairy and dark brown skin, he was a black man. black people have wool nappy hair like a sheeps hair, wool hair. and we are dark brown.

                 Depends on whatever races have burnished bronze complexions Arabs? Malayasians?  Africans?  Mixed races?. Semitic peoples were Afro-Asiatic.  Rev. 1:14 The Bible describes often makes distinction in reference to blacks as Cushite tribes  Genesis  10:6-20.   But both Egypt &amp; Israel had been subjected to thousands of conquests by the time Jesus appeared on the scene.  So the nation of Israel &amp; Egypt had been mixed with other races.  If the Israelites were really black why would Miriam make a fuss about Mosess 2nd wife, an Ethiopian woman?  Miriam was later cursed with leprosy whitened skin for railing against black skin.  Also Jesus was a Nazarene meaning under the Nazarene vow he couldnt cut his hair, didnt drink and abstained from women.  Jews under the Nazerene vows had long hair.  John the Baptist also had long hair.  Read the Bible and stop inserting your own biases.

                   Jesus wasnt Black or negroid/Ethiopian, how could he have passed as a Egyptian. same with Moses, did he not grow up as an Egyptian? the pope and many others in Europe to this day prey to a black Madonna and baby Jesus. why?Ashkenazi people claim to be of the Hebrews, yet when i look at the art of the time, the Hebrews look Africanand i dont mean sub Saharan, i mean Nubian. why is that. if it were another people, it would only take one of these facts to make a strong case. and please dont get me wrong for asking these question. Africans have had their gods stolen in the past, you know Isis and baby Horussounds like another story that came much laterdoesnt it?

                     First of all, ancient Egypt was sub-Saharan in origin which was termed the old kingdom but before Moses during the period of Jacob &amp; Esau Egypt had been conquered by the Hittite Kingdom in Asia, and after that by the Assyrian Kingdom (Asian).  Jesus came around 1600-2000 years after Moses.  By the time Jesus Christ appeared ancient Egypt had been conquered by Canaanites/Hyksos (Asian), Libyans (African), Nubians (African), Babylonians(Asian), Achaemenids (European), Persia(an empire spreading from Asia to Europe many of its kings were black or mixed) (Macedonian Greece (European) and the Romans (European).  These ancient races were mixing.  The painting of the black Madonna was posed for by a caucasian model(the features)&amp; the style is pre-renaissance religious painting.  The artist painted her with sepia which was his vision.  No painter ever saw the Madonna every painting reflects the artists visionnot truth.  Ive studied ancient Egypt &amp; ancient world history &amp; have a strong grasp of Biblical history.  However, the focus is Jesus Christ.  First of all, Jesus &amp; God ARE real and they are Spirit beings.  So for me the race issue is not vital because God has no race.  But the humanity God would most likely have put on would have been the most unassuming one and, therefore, reflective of that time.  It would not surprise me, if God would take on a form that was a mix of all races.  The historical records show the Jews of the ancient times were very much a mixed race people. The Bible is the best record of Jesus Christ, not Egyptology.   As for the issue of wooly hair well, the late Muammar Gaddafi had wooly hair.   Egypts gods werent stolen but with conquest a nations culture is greatly influenced &amp; it changes.  A nation adapts to other cultures &amp; customs adding here &amp; there or abandoning styles of worship &amp; customs.  Some things are retained while others become hybrids.  These so-called gods fell out of favor.  Seems youre worshiping blackness and it is your God rather than the LORD God Almighty who reigns in heaven.  Youre dismissive of time &amp; place.  Jesus Christ was from the Middle Eastwhich is in Asia &amp; next door to Africa.  Its unlikely Jesus was black since the one drop rule didnt exist.  But if thats the only way you can worship him then so be it.  Its the same for many whites who wont worship a non-white Jesus. Christianity is an Eastern religion.  Well  Ive posted my contribution.  Thanks for your input.  Time for silence.  Ive posted too much.  Enjoy your day.

                     first of all, i dont worship jesus or any other fictitious gods. second there is nothing proving Jesus even existedunlike the Horus and Isis, there are no sculptures or painting from that time, that show he existed. many people in europe pray to the black god(yes their is more than one statue and pictures of Isis and Horus..oops! i mean the Madonna and Jesus. history has been highjacked by Europeans, so i dont believe a word anyone says that follows the European interpretation of ancient Africa and so called Middle East. have you read the works of Ivan Van Sertima? Google him, and tell me what you think..i will say its nice to hear from someone thats open minded and has some knowledge of the European interpretation of Africans History.

                     The people who wrote the gospels were smart on this one account: If they had described Jesus physically, some people would have been able to boast that he was just like them, and, by implication, not like those others. The way they left if out, perhaps intentionally, all people can invent the Jesus that they need in order to identify, in order to feel comfortable with him.

                     they said his hair was like white woolen hair, and feet like burnished brass.by the way brass is brown and burnished brass is a dark brown. wont even get into the white woolen hair interpretation.

                     Moses grew up as an Egyptian,long before the Persians where in Egypt. Joseph and Mary hid Jesus in Egypt. yes the Egyptians had different shades of black, like black people todaywe have different shades of black , the Persian empire came just a few hundred yrs BC. when i see movies about Jesus portrayed as a white person only and everyone in the story is white, i think about the location of the storyi tend to believe that the people looked more like me than you. guess whos playing Noah in the movie of the same nameRussel Crow! get my point! now people can say what does it matter, well it matters to a people that have had a lie about their contribution to the history of the world hidden, why is it when they show Africans, they go to the unga bunga tribe?
                     <br/>
                     and rewrite history by replacing the Afro people that ruled the land back  before the Persians came? the people in Egypt today had nothing to do with the Pyramids or anything else you see from the ancient Egyptians. Europeans have wiped and re wrote history to suit their needs. and made Africans out to be stupid, with no contribution to the history of mankind. enough lies. the popes pray to the black Isis and Horus..oops sorry i mean Madonna and baby Jesus, why dont you? and please dont think Im being a hater of the white race, cause Im noti just think young Africans living around the world need to know how important they are and what their ancestors accomplished. it was only when Micheal Angelo painted Jesus, that we started seeing him as white. many European countries pray to the Black Madonna. so if Moses was seen as an Egyptian , what does that say about the Hebrews and their color? and Jesus.

                     Wow, Sampson. Guess something struck a nerve with you. All I said (I think it was all I said) was that nobody knows for sure what Jesus looked like. If scientists should find his remains some day, lets hope they can do a DNA test and that may give us some clues about his ancestry, but even then it will not be definitive. P.S. I dont worship a White Jesus.

                   Honestly, how in the world did you get those descriptions of Jesus? Surely not from the Bible, at least, not without a lot of conjecture. We simply do not know. We assume he had a human body, thats about it.

             I dont Understand it. The Bible with according to Mathew, peter, Luke and John are all individuals who happened to be born centuries after jesus died. its always the third person writing according to but who is the real author? None of these individuals were alive in his time and were centuries apart and some scholors state they did in fact live in his time which I find extremely obsurd.  Who is the author because when I read according to, its hearsay or gossip and there is no way to ask or interrogate the author let alone prove the source is remotely accurate. Can someone give me an explanation because I have never ever in my life given an answer to that even remotely sounded logical.

               I hope this helps, Erol. There are four Gospels. There is no Gospel according to Peter. Peter was a Disciple of Christ, one of the Twelve Apostles, not born centuries later. None of them were.
              </p>
              <p>
               Matthew; Was a former tax collector who was called by Jesus to be one of the Twelve Apostles.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mark; Was a follower of Peter (Again, one of the Twelve Apostles) and so an apostolic man.
              </p>
              <p>
               Luke; Was a doctor who wrote what is now the book of Luke to a friend
               <br/>
               Theophilus. Also believed to have written the book of Acts (or Acts of
               <br/>
               the Apostles) and a close friend of Paul of Tarsus. Was Luke alive in Jesus time? A precise answer is unknown, but a likely answer is yes.
              </p>
              <p>
               (Luke 1:1-4) 1 Whereas many have undertaken to compile a statement of the facts that are given full credence among us, 2 just as those who from [the] beginning became eyewitnesses and attendants of the message delivered these to us, 3 I resolved also, because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy, to write them in logical order to you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally.
              </p>
              <p>
               Luke was not an eyewitness of the life of Christ. He was a companion of Paul who also was not an eyewitness of Christs life. But, both had ample opportunity to meet the disciples who knew Christ and learn the facts not only from them, but from others in the area. As far as dating the gospel goes, Luke was written before the book of Acts and Acts does not mention Neros persecution of the Christians in A.D. 64 or the deaths of James (A.D. 62), Paul (A.D. 64), and Peter (A.D. 65). So, we can conclude that Luke was written before A.D. 62.
              </p>
              <p>
               John; Was a disciple of Jesus and possibly the youngest of his Twelve Apostles.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another interesting consideration:
              </p>
              <p>
               None of the gospels mention the destruction of the Jewish temple in 70 A.D.  This is significant because Jesus had prophesied its destruction when He said, As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down, (Luke 21:6, see also Matt. 24:1; Mark 13:1).  This prophecy was fulfilled in 70 A.D. when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and burned the Temple.

                 Roro is right, the gospels were not written hundreds of years later, but they were certainly written long after the death of Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, just because they did not mention the destruction of the temple does not mean they were not aware of it, and in fact there are allusions to that if you know how to look for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The gospels, the earliest of the NT writings were written by Paul, I think  that was some years after the event of Christ (I want to say 50 or 51 CE at least), and he never saw Christ in the flesh but he apparently did see Steven being stoned to death. The other books were written even later than that according to most secular biblical scholars, perhaps 25 or thirty years after the events they described, so you can be reasonably sure that little or nothing in the New Testament is verbatim the words of Jesus. More like, what they remembered him saying.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Go listen to a sermon sometime; have someone record it.  Then come back a year later and try to repeat it verbatim and you will see what I mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Those who believe in a book that was more or less dictated by God through the Holy Spirit are bound to interpret the bible accordingly. To them, any prophecy must have been written beforehand, in their view, and thus predicted the destruction of Jerusalem. Those with a more naturalistic approach (thats me) believe that they may well have been describing events that were taking place before their eyes, veiled as prophecies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But there is, of course, the possibility that Jesus foresaw the destruction of Jerusalem. Probably a lot of others did too, which is why the Zealots sometimes murdered other Jews who did not want to participate in the rebellion. Some Jews saw the rebellion as endangering the nation, and in fact, they were correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Well, theres a lot to be said. I invite any of you to read From Jesus to Christianity by Michael White, and then get back to me.

                   Correction: Excuse me, I meant to say the Epistles, not the gospels. Paul did not write any gospels per se, although he mentioned ideas that were also expressed in the gospels, which appear to have been written later.

                 Actually, there is a Gospel of Peter, but it is not considered genuine, and it is not in the several different Christian cannons.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Neither are the books of James and certain others considered genuine, and others are of unknown authorship, such as Hebrews, the book of John and many others.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We now know that the early church misidentified several authors. For example, they assumed that the authors of the Gospel of John, and Johns 1 &amp; 2, and the author of Book of Revelation were the same person. Historians and scholars specializing in the period of the early church have pretty much proven that this is probably mistaken.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Likewise, many  have taught that Paul was the author of Hebrews and certain other books, but they were mistaken. Even some bearing his name were probably not written by Paul.

               It is my understanding that the church  for over 350 years  generally did not accept the book of Revelation as scripture, perhaps because of its radical nature and anti-Roman implications.
              </p>
              <p>
               That all changed when Augustine promoted interpreting the book as symbolic, rather than literally vengeful.
              </p>
              <p>
               Prior to that the church, by and large, considered the content to be contrary to the Gospel of Peace. Note that, at the time, the church was trying to establish itself as respectable (i.e., trying to demonstrate to the Romans that it was not  revolutionary society).
              </p>
              <p>
               Many scenes in Revelation seemed contrary to the peaceful admonitions of the gospels: The battle scenes,  the thousand years of peace (culminating in gory vengeance), the blood-curdling Marriage Supper of the Lamb (where they were to eat the flesh of Kings and Princes), when literally taken, all seemed extreme and contrary to the mission of the church  at first.
              </p>
              <p>
               When the expectations of the Millennium  a thousand years of peace  did not come to pass, Revelation fell even more out of favor until Augustine more or less rescued the book, three hundred something years later (He was born in AD 354.).
              </p>
              <p>
               Although Augustine expanded upon a metaphorical/symbolic basis for Revelation, it seems ironic to me that the fundamentalist and evangelical strands of Christianity have rather recently revived the literal approach to understanding the book.
              </p>

             so we do know what jesus looked like. burnished bronze skin, and wool hair. sheep wool is nappy, and so are black peoples hair. black people also can be described as having a burnished bronze skin tone. wooly hair+burnished bronze skin+location just outside of africa= jesus was black. i dont know any other race of people with nappy hair like a sheep, unless they are black or have black mix in them.

                   Its so funny when people complain about him being white then plp say color doesnt matter. So if thats the case it should not matter him being black. He was taken to egypt at the time the king was killibg boys 2 year and under egypt at the time wad all black it was easy to hid him among other dark skin plp and you guys kill me with this arab look at the truth behind the true hebrew israelites the biggest secret the world hid. Lets see will any of you white truley bow to a black messiah if color does not matter

                     Does the color matter as much as Who He is. It is a matter of grace and not race but Jesus wasnt white and there is no reliable historical evidence that He was black. If He was, please provide some reputable historians please.

                     The denial is so deep that we can really feel sorry for not all but some white people. The article talks about being shocked. Who will be shocked by a white Jesus- whether he is handsome or ugly. He will still be white.

                     <br/>
                     15. For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.

                     8. But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.

                     11. Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.

                     16. Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.

                    <p>

                    <p>
                     During The Renaissance the so called White Man repainted the pictures of the Black Israelites into (White) people. Also in Russia you will see many black pictures of Christ and you will see how they have white-wash many of the paintings to make them look like white people.

                    <p>
                     JOB 9:24
                     <br/>
                     The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     To Name a few Judges are:

                     I agree with you 100% on that one. Romans 14:11 and Isaiah 45:23 specifically states that. You will bow. Like I said on another post, there will be no problem for us IF he is white (because we have seen the pictures- sarcasm heavily intended). However, on the other hand, if he is not white Now we are back to that statement you put under the picture- which we have all seen many times over.

                     Amen Mr. Franklin. Spot on sir. And now I get it.  The picture was not put up by me.  That picture is not from me but from the man who posted this (my editor) at our sister website.  I wished really that there were NO picture for we cant speculate at all.  I wish there had been no picture and no caption.  Those words were from me but they were in the article and I never intended to put them below a picture that was provide from our (apparently very inaccurate!) picture image library.  My apologies sir for responding so late. He doesnt even look near a Jew to me!  I finally see what you are saying sir and so please forgive my late response (alas, the cause of being a bi-vocational pastor). It is very hard keeping up with replies (this article alone has nearly 150!).  I am sorry for that image even being there.

                     I do not know exactly how the supposed killing of the infants got into the bible, but history records nothing of that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It seems inconceivable that something that monstrous  could happen without a mention of it somewhere in texts from the era, other than by the book of Mathew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Likewise, it is hard to imagine that Mark, Luke and Pauls writings would fail to mention it at all.

                    <p>
                     I suspect that this was interpolated or inferred by Christians who were misinterpreting some passages from the Old Testament.

                    <p>
                     Herod was certainly capable of such an act, but it does seem suspicious that no-one else thought it worthy of a mention.

                     The reason why it was not mention much was because the Romans (Racist White People) Didnt see the Black Jews as Humans. They were just animals or cattles nothing to report there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You know how many times the Black Israelites were in slavery? EGYPT In Slavery, ASSYRIA In Slavery, BABYLON In Slavery, The MEDES In Slavery and PERSIA In Slavery, GREECE In Slavery, ROME In Slavery, SPAIN In Slavery, FRANCE In Slavery, GERMANY In Slavery, RUSSIA In Slavery, GREAT BRITAIN In Slavery and AMERICA In Slavery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Black Israelites or Jews were the only people that were enslaved by the whole Nations under the SUN. Those Fake Jews in Israel never touch Slavery or ever experience it in their lives, because they were the ones buying up Black Jew Slaves from Wall Street in America.

                     Hi Michael, Dean here. I have been following your commentary here. I believe all that you are saying is right on the history of things and how things have been covered up for ages and ages and still to this day. What are your thoughts about the scripture that says Yashua came first for the Jew (biblical Black Israelites) then for the Gentile in the new testament and also says in the old testament that God will make the Gentile nation his nationalso it is mentioned in Deuteronomy 28, that when the Israelites disobey God and not keep his commandments, God will hand them over to their captives and disperse them into nations as slaves as has what has happened (not hating and not nullifying that Black Israelites are still Gods people and God will always be the God of the Israelites and still will save His people)Is there not hope for those (Gentiles) other than Israelites (according to old testament and new testament) who have turned from the evil corrupt ways taught to us or condoned by a Roman based system (evil as in justifying hatred toward true Israelites, following the ways and disceptions still put on us today whether in churches, jobs, family, schooling, sports, politics, artsand and and)
                     <br/>
                     Im not trying to disprove you here, but searching tooIm not a church goer, but believe in studying the bible and also the truth that is not completely what we see, hear and feel today. Although we were previously part of a church for many years, but left a few years ago as we dont believe God is kept in a box with four walls and a roof mainly on a sunday or as is said in Zulu Sonto and church being translated as Sontweni. I love how Yashua nullified the condemnation of the cross in Roman times and completely made it His own as a Holy remembrance and symbol of hope for others. Im sorry for all the attacks from people who say they are ChristiansI really thought that Love was supposed to resonate in word, action and thoughtsAlthough, I once had the same mindset and was blinded by what the world teaches today in all aspects. If people could just take time to stop and test and look into things more in depth, then they will see the truth and the truth will set us freeP.S this has been a gradual transition for me and God has and is revealing things to me as I goso can we not pray that those who truly love God will come to see the truth. You obviously posted commentary on here with a mindset of honesty and truth, meaning you are here to be a profit to the few or many that will undertake to not accept the ways of this world as taught to us in all aspects.

                   Thanks. I will however go with what God himself says.  His hair like wool and his skin like burnished bronze.  That is the way he described himself.  Are their other meanings to these attributes, Im sure their could be, but since the word of God is the truth, the first reading is true and the double meaning would also have to be true.  The scriptures give a general view of Christ not an identifiable attribute of Christ.
                   <br/>
                   Some of you people are in so much denial about your own prejudice I wonder if you are actually saved at all.

                     Now we have reduced this discussion as to whether someone is saved.  Really?  I do agree that the Scriptures are silent on his identifiable physical attributes, but was He not Jewish and of the tribe of Judah?

                     Does anyone here know when the book of Revelation was written? My understanding is that, at the earliest, it was written in the year 100 or later. So somebody (we dont know who, except that he went by the name John) wrote an apocalypse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We know from historians of the period that the apocalyptic was a Jewish form of fiction used to present a religious/political point of view!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And in this apocalypse, the author paints a picture of an old Black man representing God, just as the seven stars represent the seven churches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now we have someone claiming this is a physical description of Jesus, even thought is highly doubtful that the author ever saw Jesus, other in this vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So in spite of the fact that the vision is most likely but one more of the literary devices John uses,  we are here arguing over what Jesus looked like physically, based upon this fictitious work!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I am willing to concede that the author used the image of an elderly man of color to represent God. What I am not willing to concede is that this tells us anything whatsoever about the physical appearance of the man Jesus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Non of the gospel writers seemed to know what Jesus looked like, or if they did, they did not mention it.Seventy years later the odds of someone knowing were not improved.

                     Great points sir.  I believe that the description of Jesus in Revelation is not about what He looked like in His human form, as a Man but I believe that someday the Bible says that We will see Him as He is and that is the main thing that I look forward too.  Not to see just His physical, human body but His glorified one that I shall fall down before.  Great questions Mr. Lockwood. Here is my answer. I dont know but I believe we will know someday.

                    <p>
                     Mr. Wellman: If what you just wrote is true, one must still wonder why John chose those particular images to represent the image of Christ, or of Jesus, or of God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I dont have a problem with a Black Jesus, but I also have to consider the words the other John attributed to Jesus, saying, The flesh profits nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Perhaps this does not mean that the flesh is unimportant to us, just that it does not accomplish what Christ desires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The flesh, as I see it, is my body; it is this physical existence. So Jesus seems to be saying that this hunk of meat is relatively irrelevant to the program and will soon decay; it is surely nothing to get sentimental over, though we all seem to do this, myself included. I still have photos of my deceased wife of 38 years, for example.Those images remind us of the whole person. The photo is but an image, but that image brings back a lot of memories, a lot of sentiments and feelings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I think the bible is pretty clear that the physical appearance of Jesus is not of utmost importance, yet we all seem to want to see him with my own eyes, that is, see a physical person. In the case of doubting Thomas, to touch  the wounds in his hands and in his side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The truth is, we find it difficult, impossible really, to conceive of the next life or of a second coming of Christ. His Presence is all that matters, and he said he would be present any time two or three of us are gathered in his name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     What we wait for, however, is not the physical appearance of a human body, it is the Spirit of the Lord, the Glory of the Lord, to fill all the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But for this to happen we will have to discard many or most of our notions of God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Spirit of God compels people from within: His ideal world cannot be imposed from some external source or authority, be that an army, a church or religion, not even by a human Messiah who rules the earth with a rod of iron.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     A lot of Christians think that they can bring about Gods kingdom with earthly wars, but this is never true:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses, the bible says. I think this is a good plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have even seen web pages by a cult that thinks it is supposed to rule and reign in Christs stead, physically, until he comes. As I understand it, they planned to use political and military power to accomplish this, to impose their vision of Christs Kingdom. That was a dangerous approach, in my opinion. It has been tried before, I might add.

                     No matter what color Jesus Christ is, I will fall on my face. I have repented and put my trust in Him.  I hate those who use such racist names.  God will judge them for sure.

                     Who is the Whosoever in this verse 21? Verse 22 will give you the Answer to Whosoever the scripture was referring too. I find it very hard that you have not added the second verse that clarify the first. I will show you the second verse myself.

                     22 Ye men of ISRAEL, HEAR these WORDS; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So the Whosoever was referring to the ISRAELITES to HEAR these WORDS. The Romans, Africans, Persians Ethiopians Careless what Salvation is for the Nation of Israel because they were too busy worshiping their god SATAN.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The World have no interest in the GOD of ISRAEL as you can see the Romans did a good Job in Destroying JERUSALEM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Christianity was created by the Romans as a Religion to control the minds of the People to serve their god Zeus. The Most High only DEALS with the Nation of Israel and no one else.

                     <br/>
                     20. He hath NOT DEALT so with ANY NATION: and as for his iudgements, they haue not knowen them. Praise yee the Lord.

                     Amen to your statement The World have no interest in the GOD of ISRAEL as you can see the Romans did a good Job in Destroying JERUSALEM.   That is spot on and for me, I am glad that John 3:16 includes Whoever and I pray for those who do not yet know Jesus as King, Lord, and Savior and I fall on my face before my great Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ, to which I am unworthy to be saved, yet He still died for the sinners and while we were still His enemies (Rom 5:8, 11).  Amen?  Thanks Michael. I still have so much to learn my friend.

                     The Most High never forgets the lies and deceptions Esaus people do. For over 400 years we played by the White man rules, we went to your churches; we love you even while you hated us and call us bywords.

                    <p>
                     You tell us God is love, but you have not showed the Native Americans love by giving them back their land your forefathers have stolen. You have not gather all your white people who have the same belief you have to say right is right and wrong is wrong.

                    <p>
                     Your forefathers beat them in slavery and took away their language (Hebrew), Their culture (Ancient Hebrew culture), Their Land (Jerusalem/Israel),Their Names (Hebrew Names that were given by their forefathers), Their Religion (Judaism the keeping of the Laws, Statutes and Commandments and the faith in the Black Messiah of Israel; And you forced your gods upon us with violence called Christianity  The god of the Wooden Cross (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, King David, Samuel, King Solomon, Daniel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, John the Baptist, Peter, James and John had never heard about these gods called Christianity especially the one you called jesus, because that name was later invented in the late 1600s by a Roman Catholic Jesuit Monk to trick people into worshiping Zeus)

                     64. And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt SERVE OTHER gods, which neither THOU nor thy FATHERS have KNOWN, even WOOD and STONE.
                     <br/>
                     The god of WOOD (Christianity  The Wooden Cross) and the god of STONE (Islam  Black Stone of Mecca)

                     DEUTERONOMY 28:68

                     68. And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be SOLD unto your ENEMIES for BONDMEN and BONDWOMEN, and no man shall BUY (Redeem/Save) you.

                    <p>
                     You know what you told us? Forget about Slave History; God is love. Hypocrites how come you didnt forget 9/11 and the fake Jews Holocaust?
                     <br/>
                     You still have a memorial about 9/11 every year and you tell your children we will NEVER forget; The fake Jews have their memorial more than every year and they make Movies about it and the US government send them billions of dollars for it; but yet your People tell us to FORGET about SLAVERY, No Reparation for you because you are just a property?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This is why the MOST HIGH will never forget on our behalf. He will come with VENGEANCE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This was the whiteman SALVATION.
                     <br/>
                     When the Most High God gave us over to you
                     <br/>
                     (our Enemies) as a punishment for us breaking his LAWs, Statutes and Commandments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     He was going to Judge you on how you treated us.
                     <br/>
                     If your forefathers were smart enough to know this,
                     <br/>
                     they would had treated us with MERCY and God would had showed you MERCY when he comes back.

                     3. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
                     <br/>
                     The Most High said he would had bless YOU, if you had Bless Israel the so called (African Americans, Hispanics, West Indies, Native Americans and the Scatter ones), but your forefathers chose to CURSE us instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So the curse will now be upon you and your childrens children. The Families of the earth are not blessed now( They are in wars, famine and distressed because the REAL Israelites are being cursed by Esaus People (The so called Whiteman).

                     This is how the Most High is righteous. He is the GOD of Weighing things in the Balance. The Most High gave us over to you so he can prove how evil the Whitemans Heart is and that they deserved to be destroyed on judgement day.

                     Why would I need the Son of Zeus? You Romans need Jesus half god and half human demigod brother of Hercules son of Zeus, that has nothing to do with Israel ( The people you killed and burn down their TEMPLE and Destroyed their City Jerusalem and chased them into Africa for their lives) or our culture of our forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the Black Messiah who came to saved Israel from their enemies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I guess you cant burn us at the stake and crucified us for rejecting your false god Jesus this time around huh?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Here is a question you should ask your Roman forefathers  What was so wrong with the Hebrew name of the black messiah that you all have to go to such far length of changing his name from   or Yasha the REAL name of the Messiah which ( means: Savior, Deliver, Deliverer, Save, Saved, Saves, Safe, Brought salvation ) to a Roman mystical god name Jesus?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     ACTS 4:12
                     <br/>
                     12. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other NAME under heaven given among men, whereby we must be SAVED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So if there is no other name (  = Yasha) under heaven given by the Angel Gabriel to Mary to name the Savior of Israel, then why on Gods green earth did your Roman Forefathers change it to JESUS? a Roman demi god?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You see this is prophesy that is being fulfilled before your very own eyes. The Lies of your forefathers are being revealed.

                     19. O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited LIES, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.

                    <p>
                     Yep your demi god Jesus has been exposed he is not the Savior of Israel but an Impostor of the REAL one whose name is  = Yasha THE BLACK MESSIAH of ISRAEL.

I dont care if you decide you want to talk to your house plant, but you need to talk to someone, and quick  before you blow a gasket. Just breathe, itll all be alright.

                     I actually never even told you my religion, so you wouldnt have a clue whether or not Im ignorant about it. And if YOU knew anything about your religion then you would know that the devil is no ones father. He is the father of lies, but thats about it. God is everyones father, whether they believe in him or not. I think maybe it is YOU who is stupid and ignorant about your own religion.

                    <p>
                     Satan is the god of this World meaning he is the Father of Sinners because the bible says GOD do not hear Sinners when they pray to him  He only hear the Prayers of those who Keep his Commandments. So GOD is not the FATHER of Sinners, but the Father of the Righteous!

                     Oh yeah  Youre WAYYYYY out there. Nutter than a fruitcake  Here I was under the impression that God wanted us to spread His word and His love with people. Boy, was I wrong! Apparently, God wants us to resort to fear-mongering, sounding delusional, and have a huge temper tantrum in His name. I especially thought that when you meet a fellow Christian, your first instinct wouldnt be to tell them how stupid they are, and when they say they believe in God, you wouldnt tell them they are a liar and that their father is the devil. Well, thank you for opening up my eyes to what a TRUE Christian really is, and what you must do to get into Heaven  act like a total Bible-thumping toddler, insult all the people you can (even the ones who are on your side cuz lets face it  everyone is evil,) and pretty much act in such a way that would turn anyone AWAY from Christianity  (Light Bulb)  Maybe THATS your whole motive after all. If you act like a complete freak to everyone you encounter, that will drive more people away from Jesus, and toward YOUR REAL FATHER, SATAN! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNN!!! LMAO! Go play in heavy traffic. You dont interest me anymore. Im done with you.

                     I have some News for you Wendi, Want to know one of the White Mans gods? His name is
                     <br/>
                     Ptolemy I, wanted to be one of the gods of Egypt (Pharaoh).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Alexander the Greek made it possible for Ptolemy I(One of his FOUR Generals) to sit on the throne of Egypt.
                     <br/>
                     The Egyptians made an image to Ptolemy I, under duress because he threaten to kill them if they did not make him a god, they made an image called SERAPIS = SOTER = SAVIOR of Egypt. c.a. 350 B.C.E.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     SERAPIS CHRISTUS Greco-Roman c.a. 135 B.C.E.
                     <br/>
                     SERAPIS = BULL of OSIRIS then later became the nick name Iesu for Serapis then in late 1600s Iesu was later changed by making the letter i into J for Jesu then the S was added to make the name Jesus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     How can the Black Messiah of Israel be called Christ when he was not even yet born? When in 350 BC they were calling Serapis the Christ? The Followers of Serapis Christus were called Christians also Emperor Hadrian refers to the Alexandrian worshippers of Serapis calling themselves Bishops of Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Hadrian Quote: Egypt, which you commended to me, my dearest Servianus, I have found to be wholly fickle and inconsistent, and continually wafted about by every breath of fame. The worshipers of Serapis (here) are called Christians, and those who are devoted to the god Serapis (I find), call themselves Bishops of Christ.  Hadrian to Servianus, 134 A.D.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Serapis=Christus=Iesu=Jesus
                     <br/>
                     In the 1500s The Father of Cesare Borgia; A Pope of the ROMAN Catholic Church change the image of Serapis to his dead son Cesare Borgia. The new image of Christ Serapis was born thus continuing the Lies and false religion of Christianity.
                     <br/>
                     Conclusion  The Whiteman gave you Christianity and Islam
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      or Yasha the Black Messiah of Israel was never ever a CHRISTAIN. He was a JEW from the Tribe of JUDAH an ISRAELITE. His mother Miryam was not a Christian or a Roman or a Greek. Miryam was a JEW from the Tribe of Judah an ISRAELITE. Joseph was never a Greek or a Roman, he was a JEW from the Tribe of JUDAH  an Israelite from the SEED of DAVID.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The only Christians are the Romans and Greeks disciples of Serapis, Alexandrian worshippers of Serapis calling themselves Bishops of Christ or SERAPIS = BULL of OSIRIS. and that is what being a Christian means that you are a follower of the god Serapis the Bull of OSIRIS.

                     Moses wrote about what will happen to the so called African Americans, Hispanics, West Indies and Native Americans who are the REAL Israelites of the BIBLE this prophesy verify and validated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     DEUTERONOMY 28:64
                     <br/>
                     64. And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt SERVE OTHER gods, which neither THOU nor thy FATHERS have KNOWN, even WOOD and STONE.
                     <br/>
                     The god of WOOD (Christianity  The Wooden Cross  Egyptian Ankh) and the god of STONE (Islam  Black Stone of Mecca)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So Yes (Christianity  Followers of Ra and Serapis) was forced on the REAL Hebrew Israelites during SLAVERY to serve the White Mans gods of Wood and Stone in Honor of Serapis and the Sun god Ra of Egypt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When you walk into a Catholic Church you will see Serapis with the Sun Ra around his Head aka Jesus the son of the SUN god. Thats why Christians worship Ra the SUN god on SUN-DAY.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The TRUE Israelites today worship the TRUE GOD of the Universe on the 7th Day called the Sabbath according to the TEN Commandment given them with the LAWs and Statutes. The day begins for the REAL Israelites is on Sundown to Sundown and not the 12 oClock Witchen hour created by the ROMANS and GREEKS to honor and serve their pagan gods.

                     Nope. Never read either of those books. I never even saw the Harry Potter movie. Any of them. Thats probably more than you can say for yourself.

                     And I dont have time to read YOUR mess. I has nothing to do with God, and everything to do with YOU. Whatever you believe, I know for an absolute fact that God wouldnt want you to go about spreading His word in the manner in which you do  and honestly, HOW DARE YOU talk so much hate in the name of the Lord. You are NO better than those Westboro Baptist Church cult members who protest dead childrens funerals in the name of God. But you can be absolutely certain of the FACT that God will get even with all of you people who preach hate in His name. Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Romans 12:19

                     You are full of delusions. You cannot find one HATE Message in my comments, because they are all quoted from the Scriptures and backed up by facts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So I guess the Bible is HATE Words to you Edomites because you do not Keep the Laws, Commandments and Statutes of the Most High God of Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You serve another god; the god that told you the LAWs are done away with and therefore you can go and be wicked as you please because Christ died for you and your sins so that you can keep on sinning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Lord is not going to get even or Vengeance on those that Keep his Commandments, but he will destroyed those that do not keep it and teach others to do so as well.

                    <p>
                     There is nothing wrong for being so called Black. Didnt all Colors came from black?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Isnt the Most High God Black himself according to the scriptures? So why would I hate God for being black it doesnt make sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Most High God created the Original Man(Black) in his Image and likeness.
                     <br/>
                     So the Answer is no I do not hate myself for being Black.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The only people who hate Black People are racist and have a perpetual hatred toward the children of GOD because of Jealousy and Envy. They are called the Children of the Devil or the Serpent Seed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Serpent seed (Children of the Devil) will always have enmity against the Woman seed (Children of God).

                     Revelation 12:1
                     <br/>
                     1. And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a WOMAN (12 Tribes of Israel) clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     VS

                     3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great RED DRAGON (The Tribes of Esau), having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Esau (Red) always had a perpetual hatred towards his brother Jacob(black) and Esaus descendants (so called White Edomite People) always have a perpetual hatred towards Jacobs descendants (so called Black Israelite People)

Since the dawn of time has it never been recorded that two PURE Caucasian had ever produced a Black Baby.

                     Nice cussing words coming from a Christian. But wait, no worries; you carry a license to sin, because your Greek god Jesus died for your past sins , your present sins and all of your future sins. No wonder why Christianity is so attractive to sinners

                    <p>
                     6 days to be the wicked and on Sun-day worship of the Sun-god, you get all your sins forgiven and washed away so you can rinse and repeat the following week. Now that is a good insurance for sinners; Just make sure you dont miss your cash payments in tithes and offering or your sinners insurance policy would lapse and you would be in big trouble and out of salvation.

                    <p>
                     Christianity is Big Business and Tax Free. No wonder why you see 5 or 6 on every corner like a liquor store in the ghetto. When the True Black Messiah ( : Yasha) comes back he will get rid of all these Church Buildings and burn them up in the fire of destruction. Lets see if your church will save you then. And nope you cant bribe him or offer him money on that day  It will be total annihilation for sinners on that Great Day of the Lord.

                     you are one sick nigger who is craving an identity. you are not a jew nor do you have a culture. your culture is deep in the congo where your cannibal ancestors still live as they have for thousands of years . you should praise the white man for capturing your ancestors and bringing you to the americas where you have nothing else to do than to talk blasphemous things in the name of the lord. you black people have a curse on you , you are the  highest percentage in jails all over the world. you hate hard work but love handouts. you are lustful demonic creatures just like the fallen angels . another theory about where you might have come from is the fact that the children of the fallen angels need a working class to mine the earth and manipulated their dna with monkeys or the simian creatures to create you , the reason for the flood is to wipe out your kind but god redeemed you through jesus christ, so stop boastfully and foolishly declaring yourselves as having some superior bloodline. research the truth

                     ALL religion IS a scam!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Simply sad for all who are bound in the chains of strong delusion that is religions way, for they have not received a love of The TRUTH. (II Thessalonians 2:10-12)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     TRUTH IS! The Faithful are Family, The Family of Our FATHER and GOD, A Household of Faith while yet ON EARTH! (Ephesians 3:15, Galatians 6:10)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Mahatma Gandhi testified, GOD has no religion!, and in his latter years he REALized a common union with Our FATHER and GOD and Spiritual brothers and sisters who called nothing their own as they evermore sought and desired The Fruit bore in A Simple and Spiritual Life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It was as he testified, i like your christ(Messiah) but not your christians! You christians are so unlike your christ(Messiah), and so it was i believe he sought and desired to follow The Messiah on The Way to The TRUTH of The Life! (John 14:6, Matthew 7:14)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Simply, religion is anti-Messiah!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yet religion and government were, and are yet needful for the natural man, the multitudes of disobedient and gainsaying (contradicting and opposing GOD) people, stiff-necked and uncircumcised of heart and ears! (Romans 10:21, Acts 7:51)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Those who would rather have a man(Moses, etc) than Our FATHER and GOD speak to them, and would rather have a man(Saul, etc) than Our FATHER and GOD rule over them! (Exodus 20:19, l Samuel 8:4-21)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There is but One Pure Religion and Undefiled! (James 1:27)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Rightly understood, such reveals an Active Faith not religions way, as those who love their own life in and of this evil world, would have it! (Galatians 6:10, John 7:7; 12:25, I John 5:19, James 4:4)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Simply, ALL other religion IS IMPURE and DEFILED!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And Yes! atheism is a religion as well, for atheists see their version of a god each and every time they view their reflected Image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And at the end of the old covenant age, when old jerusalem was destroyed, judaism was no more! And that which calls itself israel today is wholly and totally of this evil world! (John 7:7, I John 2:15-17: 5:19, James 1:27; 4:4)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yet because of pagan catholicism and her harlot christian daughters The Way of TRUTH is evil spoken of! (II Peter 2:2)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Come out from among them and be separate! (II Corinthians 6:17)

                     Francis you are correct, All religions are Man made and false. All religion say God chose them, but they are all liars because the Most High GOD only chose one people to represent him and that is the 12 Tribes of Israel.

                     The 12 Tribes of Israel are the TRUTH CHURCH that were in the wilderness when Moses received the commandments of God to give unto the children of Israel.

                     Nah, Your Great GrandFather was a victim of Friendly Fire. The shot was meant for a black slave back in those days. BTW It was a CHRISTIAN that SHOT your Great GRANDFather because the KKK are Christians thats why they burn crosses on black peoples lawns in honor of their SUN god name Ra and Sarapis name Jesus.

                     ahhh, the good old Union vs Confederates in the Civil War.
                     <br/>
                     This was a family affairs, disputes among white brothers about how to make good use of  the Black Israelite Slaves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The North-Union was trying to educate the South-Confederates that they had a better system in place that can enslaved the blacks forever and keep them in servitude to the White people in power. The South disagree because they wanted to keep the slaves on their plantations and lands as properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The North had a better system called the legislative laws such as JIM Crow or Black-code Laws which legislatively passed those laws to prevent blacks from getting any good decent jobs that were PRESERVED only for WHITES to keep the blacks on plantations and farm lands as servants with low wages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This way the Black Slaves would think they were FREE because they would not be in chains anymore, but are not really free because of the Union matrix system that will keep them in check as servants to the system created by the Union to keep blacks as low and underclass citizens forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The South were not having it with the North and so we have a Family Feud called the civil war because of who have the rights and the better plan to own or control slaves the way they see fit. Abraham Lincoln Careless about freeing the Slaves, He wanted to have control of the Union under his presidency and it was all politically motivated.

                     Why do you want me to pray to Serapis aka (Jesus); isnt that Idolatry?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Isnt the MOST HIGH GOD  a Jealous GOD? The Black Messiah ( Not the FAKE white Jesus aka Serapis Christus who the white man made up, but the TRUE Messiah of ISRAEL ) with the HEBREW NAME:  yasha
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yasha told his disciples to PRAY to the FATHER, NOT to him.

                    <p>
                     Remember the Our Father Prayer?
                     <br/>
                     MATTHEW 6:9
                     <br/>
                     9. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Thats how I know you Christians are Idol worshippers and wicked evil Children of the Devil. You pray to Jesus the Son of Ra the SUN god. Jesus is Serapis a White man who wanted to be god over the Egyptians name Ptolemy I one of the four generals of Alexander the Greek.

                     Serapis Christus became  (Isous) Christus  by edict of Emperor Constantine in 325 A.D. Then in the late 1600s a Roman Catholic Monk took the name Isous and change the letter i into the New letter he created called the J and produce the name Jsous later it was shorten to Jesus and the whole world went after the Beast to Worship it. They worship the NAME of the BEAST called Jesus

                     Little bob, you fail to understand the evidence that is stack overwhelmingly against you. The Truth is right in your face and you are in the three types of Denial:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Type A denial is when a person sees, understands, and knows that they have a definite problem with their religion. When confronted about the problem they flat out deny it, knowing that it is true. This type of denial is outright dishonesty or lying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Type B denial is when a person is either partially or totally blind to the problem that they have with their religion being false. Through a hundred forms of self-deception, rationalization, justification and excuse making, a person can actually believe that they do not have a problem with their religion being a hoax, when everyone around them sees this is obvious. This type of denial comes from being honestly dishonest or by blindness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     2 CORINTHIANS 4:4
                     <br/>
                     4. In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Type C denial is when a person Spiritual and Intellectually denies there is a problem with their belief system even more difficult to deal with because it is so hard to see. This level of denial will lock a person into compliance blocking any possibility for seeing the Truth in order to be set FREE. The process of internalizing The Truth is more difficult to achieved and realized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Dear Little bob, I will pray for you that the Most High God open your eyes so you can see the TRUTH and be set FREE from the lies and deception of this world governed by SATAN.

                     you niggers are the  lowest form of life on earth, it is said that man is made in the image and likeness of god, do you really believe god looks like a monkey. why is it the average african american wears wigs of straight hair if they were really proud of what they look like, any fool can see that they are the ugliest creatures on earth. even the animals are more appealing than them. for those multitude of white women out there who are mixing with them, if its a pet you need get one but to mix with these outcast creatures is an abomination to the one true god

                     Those nations above represent the seven heads of the RED Dragon of revelation with ten horns and the 8th one came from the 7th which will end up into destruction. The Bible called the Dragon RED because Esau came out RED all over like an hairy garment.

                     First off, I have no clue why you are so angry. It seems like you should take a breather and try to channel Jesus because you need Him.
                     <br/>
                     Second, why are you so sure that all the white people are going to s*** a brick if Jesus turns out to be black? Personally, I think itd be cool. Jesus would be more laid back than I originally pictured. Also, if you believe the bible, we will be so in awe of Him, and filled with so much love that NO ONE is going to be calling Jesus anything except Lord.
                     <br/>
                     And third, WHY would people be suicidal if we were all dead anyway? It says in the bible that no one who isnt saved can look at Jesus. So if youre saved, and you see Him well just revert back to my second paragraph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In conclusion youre getting mad over NOTHING, and you arent being a very good Christian while youre at it. =) God is Love

                     When I wrote that I was not angry, but wouldnt you be angry if someone come into your house and rape your children, beat your grandparents up and killed them right in front of your eyes, then take you and your siblings and sell them around the world as merchandise?

                     This is how Christ feels when he comes back with vengeance on those that raped, murdered and destroyed his people. He is not coming with flowers and sweet roses in his hand handing out to people. The bible says the blood of the wicked will be many.

                     To the Wicked Christians who love to commit sins; You actually Hate The black Messiah whose name is  / Yasha and You love the White Christ Jesus aka (Serapis Christus) who you said condone all your sins because he love you when you Lie, Steal and commit Adultery and Murder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Which one of these Messiahs you think are in the image and likeness of the Father the Most High God?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Real Messiah  Yasha said to his disciples; If you LOVE me, Keep my  Commandments. John 14:15
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Fake Messiah the White Christ Jesus said its ok to BREAK every Law of God because he has Done away with it so you can Sin without conviction and a Conscious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Why do you see so many Televangelists, Preachers and Pastors getting caught in their sins on National Television? Because they believe the White Fake Jesus gave them a License to SIN and they have no shame about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Real Messiah  Yasha says Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:48
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Fake White Christ Jesus says  No one is perfect.
                     <br/>
                     God loves you as you are  so keep sinning
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Real Messiah  Yasha says Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. Matthew 5:17
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Fake White Christ Jesus says  I have come to destroy the law and the prophets and I will fulfill them all by sinning and committing every sinful act on your behalf so you can keep sinning

                    <p>
                     Bob, Do you understand that scripture?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Ephesians 2:8-9
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
                     <br/>
                     9.  Not of works, lest any man should boast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This verse is talking about the animal sacrifice laws (Works) vs the Sacrifice of the Son of God (grace) who shed his blood for the nation of Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     GRACE is not a License to keep on Sinning and Breaking Gods Law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     ROMANS 6:1-2
                     <br/>
                     1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
                     <br/>
                     2. God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When You get a CREDIT CARD Bill and you see a GRACE PERIOD to pay it off before the Penalty kicks in. Do you actually throw it in the trash and ignore the GRACE Period and say I can now Charge my credit card without Paying the Penalty or Cost?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     No, the Credit card company will shut off your spending privilege and charge you some hefty late fee and high Interest where you will have to pay it all off in the END.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Same thing occurs with the Grace in the Black Messiah   / Yasha.
                     <br/>
                     Under the Old covenant if a Man commit an Adultery, Him and the Woman would be Stone to DEATH because for that Sin there is no animal sacrifice but his and her BLOOD is required of them. There were many laws if broken under the Old Covenant the Priest have no sacrifice to forgive them, but their own blood would be the sacrifice for their sin by stoning them to DEATH.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Under the NEW Covenant there is GRACE where the Sinner this time will not get STONE to Death because The Black Messiahs Blood has given him TIME or GRACE to REPENT and be Converted to RIGHTEOUSNESS thereby avoiding the PENALTY OF SIN which is DEATH by Stoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Romans 6:23
                     <br/>
                     23. For the WAGES of SIN is DEATH; but the gift [GRACE] of God is eternal life through [REPENTANCE IN]  our Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Side Note: The reason why I put BACK the original name of the son of God () in these text of the scriptures is because the Roman Catholic Popes and Bishops had the audacity to CHANGE and put in their pagan gods name in the place of the original text in the hebrews. The Roman Catholic Church is the Great Whore and FALSE Prophet of Revelation. She has done a lot of damage and deception when she change a lot of the original text to suit her Evil and Poisonous doctrine of devils.

                     All Praises as long as it goes to the FATHER of the REAL Messiah (Yasha) of Israel the Black Messiah from the tribe of Judah who is the son of Joseph and Mariam and the Seed of David.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I challenge anyone who can trace the Origin of the name JESUS; that name has no connection to the Son of God of Israel the historical man name Yasha, but I can prove the connection and origin of the name Jesus to its Egypt / Greek / Roman Origin of Pagan gods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Think about it, what were they calling him before the 1600s?
                     <br/>
                     Remember there were no letter J in the Hebrew, Greek or English language. What were they calling him in the early 900s? What were they calling him in the early 300s?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Think People Think put on your thinking Cap on.
                     <br/>
                     Also look at the DEAD SEA Scrolls and all the manuscripts they found in the caves; you will find Yasha name in all of them there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Question: Why would the Vatican  The Roman Catholic Church would hide these original manuscripts from the public view? Why do they have guards guarding the vault where they kept all these findings and precious stones of ancient writings and artifacts? The reason is because they dont want you to see the TRUTH because they want to be the ones to control the world with their lies and made-up religion called Christianity created by Emperor Constantine I at The First Council of Nicaea in AD 325.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Question: Why would the Vatican  The Roman Catholic Church have many Statues dedicated to the Greek and Roman gods like Jupiter-Juno, Neptune-Minerva, Mars-Venus, Apollo-Diana, Vulcan-Vesta, Mercury-Ceres, Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera, Ares, Athena, Aphrodite, Hermes, Artemis, Hephaestus and many more gods if I were to write them would be in the hundreds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The gods of the Roman Catholic Church that you can go there right now and see are in the Vatican with Christian names given to them like Peter, Paul, James and John.
                     <br/>
                     The Roman Catholic Church is an Institution of Devils and Lies and You going to believe them when they created the name J E S U S and tell you that this is the son of God?

                     All so called Christians are under the Roman Catholic Church Spell and Witch Craft and Magic; That is why it is so HARD to see the TRUTH in front of your very Eyes.
                     <br/>
                     Unplug yourself from the Matrix of Lies and Deceits and be SET FREE by hearing the TRUTH.

                     How come you cant find the name Jesus in any of the ancient manuscripts or any Greek names connected to Jesus in the original ancient manuscript writings?

Keep Knocking and the Door shall be OPEN; Keep Seeking for the TRUTH and you will FIND it.  Think People Think.

                     Bob, thanks for trying. It is a vain attempt I believe.  Michael said that I went into hiding but heres why I stopped and will stop with this comment   Prov 26:5 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Or you will also be like him and 26:12 Do you see a person wise in their own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for them.  I am unsubscribed now so Michael, spew your hate and racism all you want. I am done. Take care Bob.  I had to block Michael on Google + because of his profanity and vulgar language and Jesus is right, You   will know them by your love for one another.  He needs to know Jesus for He doesnt know him right now (Matt 7:21-23).

                     Jesus aka (Serapis Christus) your god was used to killed and raped every country you invaded with this garbage called Christianity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Columbus a Big Fat Monster Troll Christian raped and killed the native americans in the name of Jesus aka (Serapis Christus). Why would anyone want to get to know a god who the white man made up?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You all worship so many gods it is ridiculous how you all keep track of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now Jack why would you go makeup a bold face lying statement like that?
                     <br/>
                     Now you see why we call the White Man the Devil? or Deceiver? Where on any posts have I used profanity and vulgar language?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Message That I spread is not HATE but TRUTH and LOVE. It is HATE when you refused to OBEY God and seek the Truth and turn away from Evils and Lies you have inherited from your forefathers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Oh by the Way, God Hate the so called white man also ( He is not white but RED all over like a hairy garment ) Genesis 25:25.
                     <br/>
                     Romans 9:13
                     <br/>
                     13. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I HATED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yep GOD HATES!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Jacob is the 12 tribes of Israel mixed with all shades of brown and dark and light skin people. Yes we do have some israelites that are RED like Esau in Israel like Mariah Carey because she have a Black Negro Israelite Father. Your Nationality is determine by your Fathers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Esau is the 7 heads on the RED Dragon of Revelation:
                     <br/>
                     Greece, Rome, Spain, France, Germany, Russia, Great Britain and the Last Kingdom of Esau which is the 8th and will GO INTO PERDITION is America.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Most High God Hate these Nations that persecute and enslaved the 12 Tribes of Israel (The so called African Americans, Hispanics, Mexicans, West Indies, Native Americans and the Scatter ones).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So yes the White man is the Devil and cannot be Trusted. You saw it here first live in action when Jack Slander me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     EXODUS 20:16
                     <br/>
                     16. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
                     <br/>
                     Slandering our neighbour. This is a sin against the ninth commandment. The scorpion carries his poison in his tail, the slanderer carries his poison in his tongue. Slandering is to report things of others unjustly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have not used profanity and vulgar language in any of my post. I know what I have written and everything I have written may same HARSH to the hypocrites because they know I am speaking the truth because the Word of God cut them sharp like a two edge sword and it HURTS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Why do you think they hated the Black Messiah when he pointed out the scribes, sadducees and pharisees Hypocrisy? They hated him and wanted to killed him. Even back then they called the Messiah speech as HATE Speech because he speaks the TRUTH that uncover their Hidden SINs.

                     This is why I hate being around other Christians. There is always a freaking huge debate, and angry assholes. I do not consider people like that to be my brother or sister in Christ to be honest. Love, long suffering, meekness, willing to die for your neighbor are all virtues. Where are the peace makers at now a days? Why so many theological debates that cause so much freaking angry people? Why so many unhappy ass people who claim to worship the Lord? I fucking hate all the shit that I hear go on constantly.. debating this, debating that. its like everyone is in this state of constant horror, and fear, and anxiety, and all sorts of stuff, emotional termoil, so much unhappiness.. I want to say all of you arent saved.. I want to say that all the people that i see in Christianity arent the Lords.

                     Id even say that I would almost rather hang out with a bunch of people who dont even know the Lord, just because people who do are such fucking assholes, emotionally unstable, emotionally abusive, constantly bickering, constantly fighting, constantly creating drama, constantly bring each other down, constantly in a state of anger, or fucking horror.. I fucking hate all of this shit. You guys need a wake up call or something imo.. I fucking hate being around Christians who are like this. Im questioning if there are even Christians in America period, because it just seems like everyone doesnt even care about anyone but themselves.. Ive never been around so many agumentitive people in my entire life. makes me sick as shit.

                     Here is PROOF that the White Man is an Atheist. He do not believe in the Bible when there is Proof that Christ is a Black man and this is rightfully fitting so. The White Man is not White but RED and are the descendants of RED ESAU. ESAU is EDOM the Father of the Red Races so called White Man.

                     8. Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is EDOM.

                     THE BEGINNING of the EDOMITES or The ROMAN EMPIRE
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Here is the beginning of the Kingdoms of Esau or Seven Heads of the RED Dragon which would start as a small seed in mount Seir which would later become:

                     GREECE, ROME, SPAIN, FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, GREAT BRITAIN and AMERICA is the 8th but yet of the 7th Kingdom called Great BRITAIN, but AMERICA will go into Perdition (archaic :  utter destruction) . REVELATION 17:8

                    <p>

                     1 MACCABEES  Another (Apocrypha) book taken out of the 1611 KING JAMES BIBLE in 1885 A.D. BECAUSE Abraham Lincoln so called FREED The Black Slaves in 1865 and it was then Legal for Blacks to READ and WRITE and that they might discover themselves as the REAL ISRAELITES of the Bible which the TRUTH of this discovery might set them FREE from the so called WhiteMans Kingdom or the Kingdom of Esau that will come to an END.

                     1 MACCABEES Chapter 1 verse 7-9
                     <br/>
                     7. So Alexander reigned twelves years, and then died.
                     <br/>
                     8. And his servants bare rule every one in his place.
                     <br/>
                     9. And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves; so did their sons after them many years: and EVILS were MULTIPLIED in the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Notice in Verse 9 when the White Man came into Power to Rule the Earth, EVILS were MULTIPLIED showing that they are the Children of the DEVIL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Alexandra the Greek became the first King of Greece (A descendant of Esau) but died at a young age and his four generals took over rulership. This was the beginning of the RED Dragon Kingdoms. Job explains who took over rulership of the world in Job 9:24
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     JOB 9:24
                     <br/>
                     24. The EARTH is given into the hand of the WICKED: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Esau (The So Called White Man) White-Wash all the Faces of the Judges of Israel during the The Renaissance era 14th to the 17th Century

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     All these Kingdoms have one thing in common; They are all DESCENDANTS of ESAU and have persecuted and enslaved the Children of Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This is the RED Dragon with 7 Heads and 10 Horns of Revelation 12:3
                     <br/>
                     Also known as the so called White Mans Kingdom of SATAN or the Kingdom of this World.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now this is not to say that SATAN have not used the other nations to enslaved the Nation of Israel. The first kingdom to enslaved the Israelites were the Africans called Egyptians, then he used the Assyrians and Babylonian, the Medes and Persian. The Persians were the last Kingdom to set the Nation of Israel FREE and RESTORED everything back to them according to the Most High Commanding them to do so. The Persian Empire even sent troops to help the Israelites build the walls of Jerusalem even in troublous times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When the Israelites from the Southern Tribe were captured by the Babylonians. Esaus descendants assisted the babylonians in the capture of the Israelites. They would block of the entrance of escape so that the Israelites had to return into captivity to the babylonians. Esaus descendants (Edomites) even shouted in favor of the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem as was told in the book of Psalms 137:7-9
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     PSALMS 137:7-9
                     <br/>
                     7. Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
                     <br/>
                     8. O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
                     <br/>
                     9. Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     King David called the Edomites the daughter of Babylon The Mystery Babylon the Great of Revelation is Edom (The Greek/Roman Empire and all its residing Kingdoms down to the Last one called AMERICA.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The difference between these nations (EGYPT, ASSYRIA, BABYLON, The MEDES and PERSIA) versus the Nations of Esau (GREECE, ROME, SPAIN, FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, GREAT BRITAIN and AMERICA) is that the other nations did not take away the Israelites Identity, Culture, Language and Heritage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Great RED Dragons Kingdoms destroyed the Nation of Israel Totally to the point that the Israelites dont even know who they are anymore. Then the Kingdom of ESAU became the Chosen people of God (THE JEW-ISH PEOPLE) via Identity theft and the Real Israelites (So called African Americans, Hispanics, West Indies, Native Americans and the Scatter ones) think they are the Heathens and the Children of ESAU are calling themselves The Children of GOD. A perfect deceptive role reversal has happen to the Children of Israel.]

                     Hi Michael
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Thank you for being so passionate about this subject. I am also not white.. my ancestors were also slaves brought on ships to work on fields for the british. We lived in many hardships.. not being able to travel in whites only buses and elevators swim in whites only beaches and sit on certain bences etc. but write as someone not saved yet.. only because I have not got down on my knees and repented of my sins (i guess I am afraid to let go and hence the Light is not in me yet in which case you may not want to read further.. but I humbly ask you to) I have a long way to go I am only asking questions here since you seem very knowledgeable. and pls excuse me calling Him Jesus
                     <br/>
                     I dont go to church cos I believe modern christianity is watered down and played out to suit the itching ears of the sinners ie the grace is all you need Gospel without being obedient anyway thats another topic
                     <br/>
                     More to the Point the Bible I guess was written not for the unbeliever but for the believer not so? Scripture does not save.. Jesus saves.. not so? Scripture is written on pages but God is Spirit not so? you quote a lot of scripture but did not Jesus say to the pharisees of the day that they were searching in scripture for salvation but did not accept him and the Word!   Is Jesus not the word spoken of in the in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God I guess if one substituted Bible for Word in that verse it would not make sense.. ie in the beginning was the Bible. Jesus was speaking to the Jews when he said many will come saying Lord Lord.. but He knew them not and perhaps no one is guaranteed of Salvation but only live in hope of it? knowing Jesus (or better still Him knowing you) you is salvation, knowing scripture is nothing without the Spirit.. after all even atheists can quote the Bible. Only Spirit gives Life Not so? Believers are called to share the Gospel with others not so? and to help others to meet Christ by the word of their testimony (as is written).. not so? Is your verbal chastisement of people here achieving anything FRUITFUL? it all seems boastful and proud and wanting to prove a point.. is not your purpose to pls God and not worry about what man thinks of you? I totally agree about modern israel and the people who reside there now calling it their land.. but I am not sure how your words bring people to know the Love that is in Christ..
                     <br/>
                     So do you think Black people are the only ones going to Heaven?
                     <br/>

                    <p>
                     Hello TCM,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The bible is clear when it said that The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. Psalm 118:22
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This Gospel about the Kingdom of God and the TRUE Messiah of Israel will be a stumbling block unto the nations that know not God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Messiah of Israel said that If you believe on him as the scripture had said  Not as the Catholic Church taught you how to believe on a false christ they made up, but on the True Black Messiah of Israel, then out of your belly shall flow Living Waters of the Spirit of understanding and wisdom which is the Holy Spirit  Then the TRUTH shall make you FREE. Free from all the lies that had been taught to our ancestors when they were in slavery in chains under the white supremacy powers and under their god which they worship called Satan in the god they trust which is the god of this world, who have deceived and blinded the eyes of the unbelievers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This Truth is not about color, but about the TRUTH and undoing the lies that had been told to our people for far too long that told us that the savior of Israel was a White Man. You see  The White man always wanted to be god and what better way to show it to a chosen people whom The Most High had chosen to be a special people above all people unto himself, Deuteronomy 7:6 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. So they can represent him as Lights unto a Dark World full of Chaos, Wickedness, Disorder, Hatred toward the innocences and they have no Fear toward the TRUE GOD of the Universe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     How long are we going to take side with the enemy and call it love? How long are we going to see the innocences die and we defend their oppressors by saying its ok  God is Love. The Most High God is not mock, What ever a Man sow, so shall he reap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The True Black Messiah said think not that I have come to bring peace: Matthew 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. The Messiah comes to bring war against the nations that have done injustice to the Ancient True Israelites that were destroyed by the Heathens. The Gentiles have Trodden down the city of Jerusalem and have scatter his people throughout the four conners of the earth!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The gospel that I peach is not Good News to this world but it is good news to a people who had been lost and forsaken and forgotten  THE 12 TRIBE of ISRAEL.

                     Matthew and John both knew Jesus. Mark knew Peter, and Peter knew Jesus. All the Gospels were written before 70 AD. Matthew was written first in Hebrew, around 42-45 AD.
                     <br/>
                     Jesus is described as ordinary-looking in the Old Testament. He would not have been black.

                     Fact 2. Since the ancient Egyptians are Africans and are Black People from HAM how in the world can a Black Pharaoh mistaken a so called White Baby Boy (Moses) for his grandson? Unless the baby has some characteristics that are similar to his characteristics as in this case his skin color was Dark or so called Black like Pharaoh. Remember Pharaoh wanted all the Israelite Baby Boys dead, hence all white baby boys would be easier to identify and distinguish from the Black baby boys of Egypt.

                     JEWS  The Word JEW is a derivative word from the word JUDAH.
                     <br/>
                     In order for you to be called a JEW you have to come from the tribe of JUDAH.
                     <br/>
                     Every JEW is an Israelite, but not every Israelite is a JEW. The Tribe of Judah consist of three tribes: Judah, Benjamin and Levi, they make up the Southern Tribe of Judah. The other Tribes make up the Northern Tribe called ISRAEL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     THE REAL JEWS ARE BLACK
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Jeremiah 14:2
                     <br/>
                     14. Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are BLACK unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Job 30:30      Job an ISRAELITE says:
                     <br/>
                     30. My skin is BLACK upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The So called Fake Jews you see in the land of Israel Today are called Kasars and ashkenazi Jewish People. The Word JEWISH or ISH is a Suffix describing something that is LIKE or RESEMBLING, but not the Original or Real Thing.
                     <br/>
                     Let me used an example for you. That GIRL looks Boy-ish meaning the GIRL is not a BOY, but she looks like a BOY. That is why the Fake Jews called themselves JEW-ISH.

                    <p>
                     REVELATION 2:9
                     <br/>
                     9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty,  (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The real Jews are black and living in poverty and tribulation through racism, oppression by racist white people. They live in ghettos and in the hoods of America and around the world. (but thou art rich) Here it says the real jews are rich because all the Promises made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are for them to inherit when Christ comes back to reward them. The Black Christ knows the LIES of those FAKE White Jew-ish people who called themselves JEWS but are not, but are the children of the Devil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Which people in the world today worship in a Synagogue? You got it!   The Jewish People  Kasars and ashkenazi people. They are known to worship Satan and thats a FACT. They also called themselves The SERPENT PEOPLE.

                     Even so, even if Jesus were black, what difference does it make. I know that He was not white but most importantly, He is God, Savior, and King, right?  Can we agree that those who are lost need to repent, confess their sins, and put their trust in Him?  That is the most critical thing about Jesus, isnt it sir?  That is what I did.

                     I am using the 1611 King James Version Bible

                     with Apocrypha. 80 Books of the Bible

                    <p>
                     Also What is The Messiah Hebrew Name before the Romans who killed him and destroyed his People in 70 AD and chased them into Africa; Stole the TORAH and TANAKH along with all the Gold and Silver and Precious Artifacts from the Temple Jerusalem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Romans at First Council of Nicaea started a Religion called Christianity, lead by Constantine I the Roman Emperor in 325 AD. This was the birth of the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. This meeting and institution had nothing to do with the Black messiah of Israel because they had killed all of the Apostles by that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Also it behoves us to be careful of a Nation (Greek/Roman) who are the ENEMY of GOD and the Nation of ISRAEL; Who believed in many gods like Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Venus, Mars Jupiter, Juno and HATE the nation of ISRAEL because they are black and the Chosen people of GOD, to pick a name they claim to translate into Greek from Hebrew to be the same name as  or Yasha ( means: Savior, Deliver, Deliverer, Save, Saved, Saves, Safe, Brought salvation ) into what we know today as JESUS meaning Son of Zeus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     By the way, What on GODs Green Earth the ROMANS need SALVATION FROM? Its the Israelites who needed SALVATION from the ROMANS from their Oppressors not the other way around.

                     Thanks friend. I too think that what matters is what Jesus will look like when He returns and if He wont say Matt 7:21-23 or Matt 25:32.  Does it really matter what He looked like in the flesh, instead just what will He say to you when He appears!  Heb 9:27, thanks friend. You get it! Even your signature, Heb 9:27 ties directly in with what I am saying.

                     That prophesy cannot be fulfilled until the DAY of the Lord  The Second Coming. The WRATH of the Lamb has not Occurred yet on the Wicked on this Earth and Every Eye has not seen him yet. And The Saints are still in their Graves.

                     It doesnt matter if Jesus was black, white, chinese, coloured or what so ever. His colour should not be the number 1 thing to worry about, what matters is that he died for our sins, who so ever believes in him will have everlasting life, God is looking for people who will seek him in spirit and in truth, he doesnt look at your skin colour, or physical appearance he looks at your spirt, your soul, your heart.
                     <br/>
                     I could go on and say so many things but ill stop by saying that you guys should stop worrying about Jesusrace and worry more about your salvation and spreading the gospel, and if Jesus wanted to tell you all about his skin colour he would have mentioned it in the bible.
                     <br/>
                     Sometimes when we worry too much on litle things we end up forgetting what matters most.

                    <p>
                     Dear Adelina, Let me ask you a question here: I dont know what race or ethnic you are, but let me setup a scenario here: Lets say you are a Caucasian Woman who are engaged to the love of your life  A Caucasian Handsome Man; One day the love of your life say to you that he have to go away to a far off land to take care of some business and he will be right back to marry you and take you to your honeymoon where you can spend some quality time with each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Days went by and he sent you love letters and you replied with your love letters to him. Months went by and you long to see him face to face; So you ask him in the next love letter to please include an update picture of himself so you can keep it as sentimental until he gets back to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The next month you received the letter and indeed a picture was included in it, but something doesnt seem right; Your future husband is not Chinese! You got nervous and said to yourself this must be a mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     A. Do you shrug it off and say Oh well color and ethnicity does not matter, I will love this Chinese man and marry him and have his babies?
                     <br/>
                     or
                     <br/>
                     B. Reply to the Letter and tell the Chinese Man you are not my future husband and demand where is the REAL Man you fell in Love with.
                     <br/>
                     or
                     <br/>
                     C. It doesnt matter at least you getting a Man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The main point I am trying to make here is not about COLOR which is only one of many identifications of the True Messiah, but about a person whose Identity have been Hijacked and Stolen. If we are to worship the TRUE God, wouldnt it behooves us to know who he is and if he walked this earth he must had a FLESHLY BODY for spirits do not have flesh and blood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And if he had a Fleshly body while he was on this earth, then that flesh is associated with an ethnic group. And if that ethnic group does not match the current ethnic group we say the Messiah came from, then what are we worshipping today? If we get this wrong then are we in BIG Trouble of Idolatry and In danger of Eternal Condemnation because we would be giving our worship, honor, glory and praise to a false god.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Thats why I cannot call you a Chinese because that is not your Ethnic group if you are a Caucasian Woman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So we must make sure that this Messiah is the TRUE Messiah of GOD and not an Impostor. If it so be that this Impostor is who we worship then we are still in our sins and not forgiven because this false Messiah had never died for us for the remission of our Sins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Have you ever wonder why historians and archeologists cannot verify that a man name Jesus ever walked this earth?
                     <br/>
                     I can prove to you of a man who have a hebrew name whose name is found in the dead sea scrolls and many biblical ancient manuscripts and historians and archeologists did verified his existence in history. Research this name:  it is Yasha; pronounce as (yaw-shah) which means ( Save, Salvation, Redeemer, Deliverer, Saved, Saves, Savior ); Do those titles sound familiar to you?
                    </p>

                     <br/>
                     12. Neither is there SALVATION in any other: for there is none other NAME under heaven given among men, whereby we must be SAVED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Oh by the way: The Bible does mention and described his color and ethnicity.

                    <p>
                     First of all, Gal 3:28 is plain: there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman,
                     <br/>
                     there is not here male and female, for all ye are one in Christ Jesus;   and Rom 3:29-
                     <br/>
                     Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Second,
                     <br/>
                     Acts 13:1  Niger was used to describe the disciples as Black
                     <br/>
                     Simeon was distinguished as black as the only apostle bearing this distinction; Acts 13:1-
                     <br/>
                     Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Flesh is not he issue: Rom 8:5-For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And Finally, Gal 3:7-8
                     <br/>
                     Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by
                     <br/>
                     faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you shall
                     <br/>
                     all the nations be blessed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Endless genealogies are meaningless, fruitless and vain.
                     <br/>
                     They stir up dissensions and quarrels, as we see here. It is the Spirit that gives life, the letter serves only to kill.

                     Thanks friend. I too think that what matters is what Jesus will look like when He returns and if He wont say Matt 7:21-23 or Matt 25:32.  Does it really matter what He looked like in the flesh, instead just what will He say to you when He appears!  Heb 9:27, thanks friend. You get it! Even your signature, Heb 9:27 ties directly in with what I am saying. Oppsdouble clicked!

                     Hi Cindy,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Nation of Israel do not condone violence, because we are a Special People called by The Most High God to show the world our Light to the gentiles by (Keeping the Laws, Statutes and Commandments) in a world full of darkness blinded by the god of this world called Satan. It is our duty to make peace with all men if all possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Revelation 14:12
                     <br/>
                     12. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of  Yasha. The True Black Messiah of Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Let the wicked continue to do evil, for their reward will follow them in the judgement as the scripture said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Revelation 22:11-12
                     <br/>
                     11. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
                     <br/>
                     12. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Leave all vengeance unto the Most High God for he said Vengeance is mine said the Lord.

                     Romans 12:19
                     <br/>
                     19. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

                     Deuteronomy 32:25
                     <br/>
                     35. To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

                     Read the book of Obadiah  The whole book is about Gods Vengeance on the Edomites and the Wicked Nations who had a hand in enslaving, raping and murdering the children of Israel. It doesnt look good for them

                   Jesus, Mary, and Joseph could not have hidden in Egypt if they had been White.  We know for a fact that the Egyptians during that time were Black, case closed.

                   What does hair like wool look like. Lets google burnt brass and see what that looks like. Why was the statement put under that white Jesus. There will be no shock if you thought he was going to look Brad Pitt and he winds up looking like George Clooney.

                     I believe Jesus was not white but looks like Jews of today since He too was fully (100%) Jewish (Matt 1).  Thank you Mr. Franklin.  I never insinuated that He was white at any time and if it came out that way, I am sorry sir.

                   A letter from Pontius Pilot to Tiberius(which in now in American Museum) describes Jesus. Since Pilot actually saw Jesus I would have to think his description is the truth as why would he lie to his superior. Other documents of that time agree with this description. Jesus, from Nazareth, looked like a Nazarene. Reddish brown or golden brown hair and tanned from exposure to the desert AND all documents say Jesus had blue or gray eyes. Hair longish below ears.  Why would gifted artists want to portray Jesus in their paintings other than what they researched and believed he looked like? Early wall paintings in Egypt show the Jews as tan skinned but not dark or black (Egyptians are shown black)

                   But he most certainly was not white. The bible says he looked like the people, they could not tell him a part on looks, only his actions and words. I believe Jesus loves this entire human race, he does NOT CARE ABOUT OUR SKIN TONE, ONLY BEING BORN AGAIN, OUR LOVE, OUR COMPASSION, FOLLOWING HIS WORD, AND KNOW THAT HE IS THE ONLY WAY! FUSSING AND ARGUING OVER COLOR IS WRONG! JESUS LOVES EVERYONE, JUST HATES OUR SIN. REPENT EVERYONE, AND ALLOW HIM TO LIVE IN YOUR HEART, ASK THE HOLY SPIRIT TO GUIDE YOU AND FILL YOU WITH THE LOVE OF JESUS!

                 Jesus was in fact a dark skinned man from the tribe of Judah.  The Bible clearly states what his appearance was.  Wall carvings found in the Roman catacombs where the Christians gathered show Jesus as a dark skinned man.

                 Notice his feet were like brass and then you take that brass element and burn it in fire it will turn black.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Daniel also saw him and described him as in Daniel 10:6 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Notice also here that Daniel is describing the colour of Gods arms and feet (Polished Brass) just like what John the Apostle saw on the Isle of Patmos about Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Daniel 7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Notice it says that the hair is like pure wool describing the texture of it which only can be found in Negro descendants; Or the so called Black people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to John the Apostle and Daniel the Prophet both were describing a Black Man with Woolly hair unlike a White man with thin Blonde, brown hair or blue or green eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dont you know that Blonde Hair is a sign of Leprosy and is considered in the Bible unclean? Read:
                 <br/>
                 Leviticus 13:30
                 <br/>
                 30. Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a YELLOW thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So Christ could not have any sign of Leprosy for it was a curse and Christ is not Cursed, but a Blessing to the Children of Israel.
                </p>

                   Burning in a furnace means the brass was a radiant bright orange to white color. That is how most metals look after coming out of a furnace. We know who the true Jews are and the world does too. Your are dilusional. Youre in bondage to black skin. Youre world evolves around black skin. Jews were never and will never be black people. Stop this foolishness.

                     Hi John, Sorry for your delusional explanation of brass being burn in a furnace. Its not your fault, but the european school system that taught you in their white image that everything they set their foot on is theirs for the taking. Every country they conquered they have whitewash that society, culture and tradition of the native people of that land (parasites).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It is very hard for you to imagine that the God of this universe is polish brass in color because now it makes you feel alienated like you have alienated and oppressed his people for far too long now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Do you understand that no ruling class of people can be in power forever? Have you ever seen Kingdoms rise and Kingdoms fall? The white people (or White supremacy) in power is coming to an end and the power of rulership will be return to the rightful ones whom the Creator of this Universe intended for it to be with; And that is with the SAINTS of The Most High God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Daniel 7:18
                     <br/>
                     18. But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You mean for Ever ever? yes Forever!

                     I hope you realize now that the dark skinned Palestinians are right there in Palestine but they are treated as minorities.  They are called Cush which is the same as the N word used in America.  BTW I am a true Black American.  The first people to inhabit what is now called the USA were Africans.  We were here long before the Native Americans.  Lots of facts have been left out of American History.

                     The Black Christ is not African, but a JEW from the Tribe of JUDAH. Every where the White Man touch his toes on he possessed it as his OWN. He is a Thief, Murderer and a Parasite. Those RacistWhite Jewish people are Impostors. They stole the Culture, Language, Heritage and Religion of a Black People (The Real Jews) who were chased and Murdered by the Romans in 70 AD and the ones who escaped ran into AFRICA for FREEDOM from the Roman Persecutions.

                     In the year 65 B.C. the Roman armies under General Pompey captured Jerusalem. In 70 A.D. General Vespasian and his son, Titus put an end to the Jewish state, with great slaughter. During the period of the military governors of Palestine, many outrages and atrocities were committed against the residue of the people. During the period from Pompey to Julius, it has been estimated that over 1,000,000 Jews FLED into AFRICA, fleeing from Roman persecution and slavery. The SLAVE MARKETS were full of BLACK Jewish slaves.

                     HAM  (hm, perhaps hot). 1. The youngest son of Noah, born probably about 96 years before the Flood; and one of eight persons to live through the Flood. He became the progenitor of the dark races; NOT THE NEGROES, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites (Gen. 10:6-20). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Notice the Jewish scholars know that the so called NEGROES (So called African Americans) are not AFRICAN, but from the lineage of SHEM and not HAM like the Africans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Fact 2. Since the ancient Egyptians are Africans and are Black People from HAM how in the world can a Black Pharaoh mistaken a so called White Baby Boy (Moses) for his grandson? Unless the baby has some characteristics that are similar to his characteristics as in this case his skin color was Dark or so called Black like Pharaoh. Remember Pharaoh wanted all the Israelite Baby Boys dead, hence all white baby boys would be easier to identify and distinguish from the Black baby boys of Egypt.

                     JEWS  The Word JEW is a derivative word from the word JUDAH.
                     <br/>
                     In order for you to be called a JEW you have to come from the tribe of JUDAH.
                     <br/>
                     Every JEW is an Israelite, but not every Israelite is a JEW. The Tribe of Judah consist of three tribes: Judah, Benjamin and Levi, they make up the Southern Tribe of Judah. The other Tribes make up the Northern Tribe called ISRAEL.

                     10. Our skin was BLACK like an OVEN because of the terrible famine.

                     8. Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.

                    <p>
                     Job 30:30      Job an ISRAELITE says:
                     <br/>
                     30. My skin is BLACK upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

                     The So called Fake Jews you see in the land of Israel Today are called Kasars and ashkenazi Jewish People. The Word JEWISH or ISH is a Suffix describing something that is LIKE or RESEMBLING, but not the Original or Real Thing.
                     <br/>
                     Let me used an example for you. That GIRL looks Boy-ish meaning the GIRL is not a BOY, but she looks like a BOY. That is why the Fake Jews called themselves JEW-ISH.

                    <p>
                     REVELATION 2:9
                     <br/>
                     9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty,  (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The real Jews are black and living in poverty and tribulation through racism, oppression by racist white people. They live in ghettos and in the hoods of America and around the world. (but thou art rich) Here it says the real jews are rich because all the Promises made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are for them to inherit when Christ comes back to reward them. The Black Christ knows the LIES of those FAKE White Jew-ish people who called themselves JEWS but are not, but are the children of the Devil.

                 So called Jesus (Which is not his real Hebrew Name) is not Arab. Palestinians are Arabs who are descendants of Ishmael. The so called Palestinians are  Ishmaelites and The Black Messiah is not an  Ishmaelite, but a JEW.

               The vast majority of the Bible took place in the Middle East, in and around Israel. Neither black nor white people are common in these regions. The vast majority of the people in the Bible were Semitic, light to dark brown in complexion.And It doesnt say that he have a wool hair it just said what color it is, white like wool.

              <p>
               Revelation 1:13-18 13 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,[a] dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. 16 In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.

                 just like we are not the original people in the Americas..and the blond hair blue eyed European jew has nothing to do with the original Hebrews. but there they are in the holy land claiming they are the direct descendents of the hebrewslook at a map and see the geography,Arabs in the region, including Africa are not the original Africans eitherbut believe whatever you want..Europeans usually make a history that makes them the saviorsnot saying youre of European descent but the world is basically run by their history. did you know that African people were the original peoples in asia and  the orient and even the Americas? ever wonder why south America has Pyramids? look

                     What Edomite Madness is this? Keep your Greek Christ to yourself and learn the TRUTH from the Chosen people called the Israelites. You Gentiles cannot teach us anything for the word of God was never given to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Psalms 147:19-20
                     <br/>
                     19. He sheweth his WORD unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
                     <br/>
                     20. He hath NOT DEALT so with any NATION: and as for his judgments, they have NOT known them. Praise ye the LORD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So if you Edomites want to learn about the TRUE God just find a fellow hebrew Israelite and ask them to teach you.

                     I wished you would had said that to your racist forefathers when they were beating the Slaves who were Israelites and tell them how hateful and racist they are when they rape, rob, stolen the land and kill off the ones who resisted their pagan gods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Wasnt it blasphemy when your forefathers told the black israelite slaves that the white man is their god and they must obey and worship him?

                    <p>
                     Isnt it hateful to treat another human person worse than an animal and beat them to death and lynch them on trees and take pictures for stamp collections? Isnt it inhumane to take the babies of the black Israelite women and feed their babies to Alligators as Bait in order to catch Alligators for skin? And that is just a few of horrible stories my people suffered at the hands of your wicked hateful racist forefathers.

Ok I have had some visions the frist one was of a man tall slinder could not see anything just the white robe with red like scarf over shoulder ok next he showed me the Crystal blue waters parting and the land splits and water running in between it ok than as time went on he showed me in vision lots of people sranding in very bright colorful robs than later he showed me vision of what looked like Jesus standing in a field he did have hair like the picture shows and was dressed in white I didnt see his face than here comes another man big not slinder hair long like Jesus with white beard holding a sword wearing a red robe.  Than its like he wanted me to see the holy temple is being rebuilt and showed me a man who appears to be Obama

                     Hi Violet,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This advice I can give you. Make sure your visions is in line with the WORD of GOD. If your vision contradicts his words, then do not believe the vision because the Most High God cannot contradict himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Joel 2:28
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     28. And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

                    <p>
                     7. Behold, he cometh with CLOUDS; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

                    <p>
                     42.  I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     43. And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly.

                     The Bible never said that the Black Messiah hair was LONG, but it did say thaT HIS HAIR WAS WHITE LIKE WOOL

                     14. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

                    <p>
                     For his eyes were RED because he drank wine, but not as a drunkard.

                     12. His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

                     And nope the bible never stated anything about Obama. The whole bible is about Him and His people whom he has Chosen to represent him in ruling the WORLD as Kings and Priests and the Fall of such people and the Redemption of such people back to their glory to reign with him when he comes back to save them from their ENEMIES. This is SALVATION for the Children of Israel ( The so called African Americans, hispanics, Native Americans and the Scatter ones).

                     I absolutely adore how all of your scriptural references, besides one that only very trivially supports your main point, the one in revelation come from the old testament. The old testament- you mean the collection of books before Jesus came to save the Jew AND the gentile? Yes. I mean that one. Today, there is no difference between the ethnic Jewish Christian or the half black-half white one thats typing. That is the bottom line. It may seem childish to reference a childrens song that isnt scriptural here but clearly youve never heard it. Red or yellow, black or white, they are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the little children of the WORLD. this includes Israel and every other inch of land that is on earth. As an American I stand with Israel as the holy land. But I can not condone racism or nationalism of any kind. Especially a type that relies on misinterpreting or bending scripture. Almost like the neo Nazi party. Funny. God bless, love you as a brother in Christ but not as a prejudiced individual.

                     All our black people back then went through horrible things but we shall rise above our enemies we are God people. Lord forgive us for our sin as we forgive those that sin against us. Lord I put my enemies in thy hands and let thy will be done. Believe me all the white people done evil unto our black people their children will suffer at God hand for their father and mother deeds. Read about David in the Bible then you understand what Im talking about God do punish people for their evil deeds, not when we wanted it to happen, but when he chose it to happen. Please read your bible and ask God to give you understand of his words and Jesus not man.

                     Sorry but you are WRONG. Even if what you say is true (Which it is NOT), how do you know what happened wasnt Gods judgment on his so-called Chosen people for disobeying him and turning their back on Him? You dont think the dust bowl and the depression were punishment enough? But the black folks who so badly want white people to be punished wouldnt have anything to look forward to would they? Try this on for size: In Jeremiah, it is written: The father shall bite the sour grape but will NOT put the childs teeth on edge.  There are many passages that say the child will NOT suffer for the fathers sins. The ONE passage that DOES say that they will is written to the people of Israel in the desert. And even THEN it says to the TENTH generation TO THEM THAT HATE GOD. Well, if they hate God, it could be FIFTY generations and God is still going to punish them! But as soon as one generation turns from their sin the curse is ABOLISHED!

                     Look the bible had never said that Jesus was black the bible says that Jesus head and hair was white as snow. So look the bible had never called Jesus black it call him white if you really study it hard you will see it had never called him black it only call him white.

                     you are a liar and should be expelled from society of non whites by the way non whites dont have the systemic power to be racist. racism,colonialism,sexism,feminism,classism,imperialism,fascism,jim crows law segregation apartheid are all white creations  concentration camps as well.christianity is not a white religion whites converted from pagans to Christians in 1100 bc e. whites are devils who are not faithful in relationships  marriages and religions besides white inferior rejects also cant coexist with any human races.

                     Wow, what a disgrace. You are a hypocritical liar if you think there arent black  racist, cheaters, murderers, rapist, etc. You are racist. Most blacks are too busy bringing up the past to use as a crutch to notice all the crime they commit in the US or the rest of the world. Look at a lot of the poorly run countries in Africa.. Look at all the evil over there where they are at war with their own people because they cant even get along with their own. You dont here whites bringing up every single bad thing that happened to them. Blacks were not the only race enslaved.  In 1530-1780 millions of whites were captured and forced to work in north Africa. I million white slaves a year were captured, slaughtered, beaten, starved, etc.. There were more white slaves than black slaves , so get over your pity party, and stoped playing the victim because blacks arent owed anything.. Quit the blame game because all races have been through horrible events, and it was before our time

                     Stop using the racist card as a crutch.. Tons of White people bust their butts just as hard as anyone else.. I dont need some black person telling me I get things handed to me. I know plenty of whites who work their butts off and dont get one red cent handed to them.. I see plenty of poor white people struggling just like many.. You dont work harder than anyone else just because youre black

                     That is a crock of bull that your hate filled black professors have taught you! Racism is hating someone because of their race. You hate ALL white people regardless of who or where they come from. THAT is racism! Hating the people who owned slaves for what THEY did to your forefathers is a LOT different than hating their descendants for something their forefathers did. My grandparents (who were Scots and Irish descent) picked cotton for one dollar a day right beside black folks. But you would hate them too just because hey,  they are white, so they deserve to be hated.. Did you know black people owned slaves?Do you have as much hate for THEM? Somehow I doubt it. .
                     <br/>
                     Youre nothing but a hater who is incapable of loving anyone. Straight from the pits of hell. Get thee HENCE.

                     This ignoramus above screeename Michael who calls white people Edomites doesnt know his elbow from hiswellhe has no idea what he is talking about. He is part of the fringe kooks who think black people are the 12 tribes of Israel and direct descendants of Adam. Which is the biggest CROCK of dung ever. The proof is in what Adams name is in Hebrew. His name is Adawm which means ruddy complected; to show blood in the face, to be able to BLUSH, Can black people BLUSH? Can they show blood in their face? Now does that mean they are not open to salvation? Of course not. Its just they want (Big surprise) to be Gods Favorites because they have the mistaken idea that God HAS favorite people. They cant stand the thought of being (Ewww!) Gentiles because they were the last to receive the Gospel. Well, the word Gentile in Greek is Ethnos which is where we get our word Ethnic today. This fringe group ALSO thinks King James of England was black! HAAA! THAT is REALLY weird.

                     The image you shared is seductive and opposes what a biblical definition of a woman is. I saw you tell a man on here who quoted scripture that he did not know what he was talking about, so you do not think God knows what he is talking about? Gods word is absolute. You should not make God in your image.

                     Ezekial 23:12-18

                    <p>
                     She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.

                     <br/>
                     Likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire

                     All who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit. Their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame.

                     Galatians 5:19-21
                     <br/>
                     Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

                     <br/>
                     For, speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error.

                     <br/>
                     Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.

                     <br/>
                     And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.

                     Proverbs 31:30
                     <br/>
                     Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

                     <br/>
                     There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.

                   So it is that those who have not received a love of The TRUTH yet abide in their own vain imaginations and/or the vain imaginations of others as they evermore destroy Creation(air, water, land, vegetation, creatures) and pervert that which IS SPIRIT(TRUTH, Light, Life, Peace, Love, Faith, Grace, Hope, Joy, Wisdom,,,,,,, ALL that IS Truly GOOD)!

                     I bet Dr. Alex is mixing up some spell potions to keep you out of the refrigerator and food shelves. I would really like to see the results on that one.

                     Good points Anti-Witch Doctor.  What does a love spell include? I would bet that the spell is put on those who call and shows up in an astronomical phone bill!

                 There was no such thing as the Nation if Israel only the House of Israel. Middle east back then was all Africa before Europeans stole our land. The original Hebrews were black. Please quit trying to change our history. Weve been rob of that enough. Cleopatra was not white either, Egypt is also apart of Africa.

                 there is yet another description of Jesus in the bible. Daniel 7:9 And  the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the HAIR OF HIS HEAD LIKE THE PURE WOOL :His throne was like fiery flames, and his wheels as burning fire. His hair is like pure wool, wool is likened unto an Africans hair. Black people are distinguished by the wooly appearance of their hair, its unique to black people. burnished bronze is black when burnt. Furthermore, science traces every person back to a black ancestor in Africa from mitochondrial DNA, so adam and eve were also black, Egyptians, the cradle of civilization were blacks, the israelites that were led out of egypt were blacks, and the real jews are black, the ones today in jerusalem are false jews, they do not believe Christ was the messiah. Like the Bible did say they say they are jews, but are really the synagogue of satan. Jesus Christ was a black man. The earth is of one blood and the black person has the widest genetic variation to bring about all phenotypic differences we see in the human race.

                 Uhhh..what year did the white explorers name the Middle East the Middle East? It was waayyy after this period mentioned in the Bible. The Middle East was referred to as East Africa in those days..it was not called the middle east and the white/dark skin mixing had not started. It was basically blacks and albinos with lighter skin like on the ancient Egyptian wall paintings.

               By wool, he actually meant like the colour of wool not the the actual texture -_-.  His hair in visions is most of the time, white, like that of wool. And bronze skin, like a Middle Eastern Jewish person.

               There is no such thing as a Middle East that makes no sense the PLACE THEY PLACE CALL THE MIDDLE EAST IS ALSO AFRICA , the fake jews changed to confuse U even more ..but the twelve brothers 7 of them married EGYPTION women they came in to EGYPT as 12 and left with over 400k if ISRAELITES were white through mixing with EGYPTION they didnt leave white , but we know according to the bible they were all black never been white or what we call clean Leprus

               - or  even english ? the quote your reading says his head (as in
               <br/>
               his face, his countenance, his complexion, his skin)  and his
               <br/>
               hair is white like wool white as snow. There is no mention as to the
               <br/>
               texture of the hair but wool from the sheep of the middle east is as
               <br/>
               straight as rabbits fur. Not nappy or curly only eurasian caucasoid
               <br/>
               people have hair of the texture of the type of sheep of the ancient
               <br/>
               mid east  -which is a urail sheep.

               You

               want to know the truth. You love to hear lies that pump up your ego.
               <br/>
               The modern sheep you clowns think looks like congoloid / negroid hair
               <br/>
               (- which actually does not except maybe in a photo)  that type
               <br/>
               of sheeps wool you like to call wooly like an afro hair do- is a
               <br/>
               modern western european sheep from scotland and they did not exist in
               <br/>
               the ancient world . They have been selectively bred for maximum yield
               <br/>
               by wool merchants and only  in  the last few hundred years
               <br/>
               have they been developed. They are not found in eurasia and certainly
               <br/>
               not 2,000 years ago. They still use the straight haired urial type
               <br/>
               sheep in north africa and the mid east today; so poof there went that
               <br/>
               stupid argument up in smoke -not that it was relevant anyway
               <br/>
               considering the text is obviously referencing color  white. Just
               <br/>
               like the line  that describes the Nazarenes as white as snow and
               <br/>
               white as milk  Ever heard of Jesus of Nazareth the
               <br/>
               Nazarene? Duhhh
               <br/>
               as far as your 2 tone black feet nonsense comment.
               <br/>
               - do you need some medication for your mental illness? If you are
               <br/>
               refering to the revelation 1:15
               <br/>
               about feet like brass burnig in a furnace and implying that infers
               <br/>
               black then you are mistaken. That means glowing white hot. Have you
               <br/>

               <br/>
               are no Negroids in the Bible. The bible and its culture was

               developed thousands of miles away from the nearest subsaharan
               <br/>
               african. get over it You come from the congo in subsaharan africa not

               the medeteranin. your racist . And illiterate. And making a fool of
               <br/>
               yourself. Your culture is in the congo. You want to read the bible

               using van sertima as a refrence? wow pathetic. that clown is an open ardent racist and engages in academic fraud  for a living not just for fun. I suggest you ask yourself why you derive pleasure from imagining Jesus looking like you. See if you can give yourself an honest answer. Furthermore the quote from revelation above is spurious / erronious in its translation. The correct translation is not burnished bronze,  its glowing like brass which is very different not that we are talking about skin tone anyway. This is all allegory in refrence to the light body but if it were about the complexionit would be obvious to anyone that its refrenceing a caucasian which is what you would expect from a book about and by caucasian cultures from the Mediterranean. Jesus et al were not in Botswana image from a synagog floor from the biblical period depicting people who are clearly not negroid. If you need Jesus ton be negroid then you are in more trouble than you know

               The term black can be very misleading. As recently as colonial America the term black was used to denote any race that was considered shady, or shadowed, dusky or mysterious. This is why Native American were also, often descried as black, long before the term red an came into the lexicon.
               <br/>
               Further black people are not black, they are various shades of brown, ranging from a nearly white tan to a the deepest brown of scorched earth. With this in mind it is clear that most races excluding Nordic races can be described as black.

                 The Awassi (Arabic: ) is a local sheep breed in South-West Asia originated in the Syro-Arabian desert. Other local names can also be Ivesi, Baladi, Deiri, Syrian, Ausi, Nuami or Gezirieh.[1] It is a fat-tailed type and is multi coloured: white with brown head and legs (sometimes also black or brown). The ears are long and drooping.[2]

             About Jesus being not much to look at.  There are at least two possible reasons that we have no physical description of Jesus, the first being that there may have been no such person, or that the person was so obscure that no one writing about him really had any idea what he looked like.
            </p>
            <p>
             A second reason, of course, might be that physical appearance was not that important to the writers. In which case I would agree that Jesus appearance must not have been unusual.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, any description based upon Isaiah is, frankly, suspect.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once the Jesus movement decided to promote the idea that the crucified man, Jesus, was indeed the Christ (the Messiah), they began searching the scriptures for any evidence they might find to support their theory.The association of Christ with the Isaiah verses held such similarities to the crucifixion that were too much to pass over, so the church assumed from early on that these passages were with reference to a crucified Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems doubtful to me that this interpretation would have occurred to the author. As is well known among theologians, the church also misunderstood verses found in the Septuagint with regard to the Virgin Mary, in order to support their theory of the godhood of Christ. Scholars have since compared the Septuagint with earlier manuscripts so they know that what began as a translators error ended up as a major doctrine of the early church.
            </p>
            <p>
             A good primary source for the history of the early church might be Michael Whites From Jesus to Christianity. Relatively easy to read/follow, with plenty of documentation.

               Ive seen Jesus Christ in my dream actually it was my childhood wish to see him and to talk to him face to face. And that wish was fulfilled on April 26, 2014. When I open this up to someone she taught I was crazy she never believed me. About his real / exact image as Ive seen him he was good looking and very handsome. But no one can paint or draw his exact image because he doesnt want to be painted. He erased it from my mind same also to those people who saw him through visions or dreams. But if there is someone chosen who could paint him and I could see it I can tell if it is him (Jesus) or not. All of the pictures you see now isnt his exact image all of those was imaginations they keep on trying to figure out his face but couldnt.
               <br/>
               When you are with him you will feel peace and tranquility and you know that he isnt man. The person you are with isnt a man.NO ONE IS WORTHY to portray as him.

               Christ was a tall man,his white robe, had fair skin( I am  Filipino so fair for me is brown or bronze Jesus skin is like that becasue it wasnt black) ,

               a
               <br/>
               long nose,his eyes even if we talked face to face and eye to eye as he was holding my shoulders (so you can imagine how close we were that time) Im not
               <br/>
               certain of its color, auburn or brown
               <br/>
               colored
               <br/>
               hair parted in the middle and
               <br/>
               falling
               <br/>
               to his shoulders it was straight no curls , and a beard with
               <br/>
               a
               <br/>

               his beard .

               brown eyes, as did his mother

               Mary,
               <br/>
               but remember Christ was only half

               not a Jews.

               this is how I described Jesus in
               <br/>
               my dream but he was too
               <br/>

                 Jessa, that was your personal vision of Christ, not an objective perspective, and your mind apparently attached physical characteristics to the Christ so that you could relate to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many other people sense or believe that they have encountered the living Christ, some in dreams, yet their idealization probably is not identical to yours. If God is a Spirit, it follows that you have taken a spirit and given Him physical properties in order to meet your own needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Because we do not have a physical Christ to relate to, we all create, or our minds create, idealizations that we mistake for the actual thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If Christ is the express image of God as the Good Book says, then he is not actually God, but an accurate image or reflection of God, just as the Bible says he is!
                </p>
                <p>
                 But for many humans, Christ is indistinguishable from God, and their visions or mental images of him take the place of the real thing, whatever that is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 God is beyond physics, and beyond mind.

                   First I am a believer of God. Maybe, but  he appeared to me four times in dreams. Two from Satan, It was just a very big snake with many heads. The one above that was my first encounter of him. My first dream: is that I saw myself when I was a kid like only six  or seven years old, and me in my age now. He said that they were watching me and is pleased. I was puzzled so I asked him who is with him and then he point his finger in the clouds at first I didnt see anything but after a few seconds I saw blurred images then it gets clearer and clearer then I saw the angels they were all smiling at me and  I know there is someone in front of them I didnt see him even his image. After that Jesus touch my shoulders and I woke up.

                 Well said Lisa.  Everyone will have to give an account someday and bend the knee and confess that Jesus is Lord.  I would rather be you or me on that day and bend the knee today and know Him as Savior than someday know Him as Judge (e.g. Rev 20:11-15).  Thank you for your words of wisdom.

             Jack Wellman, if you and I are ever going to see Jesus, it will be with the eyes of the Spirit, not with these marbles in our foreheads. As Paul noted, the flesh is nothing: It is the spirit that counts. He was most likely saying this in response to James and John and others in Jerusalem who could brag that they had seen him in the flesh. Paul said they did not have anything on him at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later on, the author John came along and wrote that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paul himself wrote that there is an earthly body and there is a spiritual body, and that they are not the same. He said he would not try to describe the spiritual body, but that when we see him we shall be like him. Seeing him, in other words, is a life-transforming experience.

               You offer very little if any actual scriptures to support your statements and when you do you take them way out of context.  Have you been born of the water and the Spirit?

                 Perhaps this will help, as I think it describes very well what Paul believed about the nature of the resurrected body. Earthly bodies are physical, resurrected bodies, in contrast, are spiritual according to Paul.
                </p>
                <p>
                 1 Corinthians 15:35-58 New International Version (NIV)
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Resurrection Body
                </p>
                <p>
                 35 But someone will ask, How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come? 36 How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37 When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 38 But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. 39 Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. 40 There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. 41 The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.
                </p>
                <p>
                 42 So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45 So it is written: The first man Adam became a living being[a]; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. 46 The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 47 The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. 48 As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. 49 And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we[b] bear the image of the heavenly man.
                </p>
                <p>
                 50 I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 51 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed 52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: Death has been swallowed up in victory.

             RE: Revelation 1:13-18 The passages is not and was never meant to be a physical description of Jesus Christ, and to interpret it that way is to slaughter the message. He holds stars in his hand, which are the seven churches: The entire passage (said to have been written around 95 CE) is chock full of metaphors and similes: The golden sash, the white hair representing wisdom and antiquity, eyes being flames of fire, feet made of ornamental metal, voice is water and so on and so forth. People who derive from that the physical details of Jesus or of God are missing the point.

               Yeshua  is his real name (Jesus) is a translation from Greek meaning  Zeus son first, the letter j wasnt invented until the 15th century way past the death and resurrection of Christ .Yeshusa is a African name Historical fact : blacks were the first race.. when we migrated further north our pigment changed due to harsh cold (cavemen ) ok so to break this down . Moses took the slaves to the promise land (Israel )from Egypt  at that time everybody was people of color . other then the ones who migrated up north and came back down to places like (Rome Greece ect) well while Moses was traveling we all know some didnt believe in the promise land and settled in various places like Ethiopia ect.( okay now  common sense has to play at some point . you have a country like Rome who RAPE &amp; PILLAGE ) so Moses makes it to the promised land and many years later the white complexion Romans mate, rape .. everything we already know .. and now the Jews are white or tan complexion over many many years  (remember Moses and Yeshua never shared the world together ) ok now we have young Yeshua (Jesus )born in Africa in the Tribe Of Judah (never seen a white man in a  Tribe before ) studied in Egypt . Yeshua (Jesus) mission was to save who so ever believeth in him but more so to help his fellow Jews who lost their way. Think of todays society and race is our biggest issue for a reason  This Black man claiming he is the son of God in front of a bunch of noble white Jews. The end result ,the white jews could not accept a black God. But their was some whites who did  the Romans .. The Romans  After stealing killing murdering they came to the Glory of God  But as many dont know Constantine was of color and his roman follows would not follow a black Yeshua (jesus) so they changed his complexion to suit their congregation (their are black jesus photos older then Leonardos paitings) also the sabbath was changed as well to suit the work week (God put remember the sabbath and keep it holy for a reason friday noon to saturday not SUNDAY) Lord knew someone would change it (smh) See the is a relevance to the color of our savor is very important ( the meek shall inherit the earth ) if we knew that we been oppressed since the days of our Lord and savoir what would you think the outcome would be (the meek might have inhered the earth alot sooner) But he did come with the intention that race shouldnt matter (but God knows it matters) Black Fact : if we mate with any race we are the dominate gene thats because we all was the same race at one point .Deny that Have a blessed day !!!!

             Michael Tellinger is living in the most amazing times and is teaching us things, he himself might not have seen this video but Im sure he knows the history of what he is finding and sharing with the world.  How will they tell the Christians that Jesus was not white, being Egyptian is being a tanned colour.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Jesus Christ changed his religion when the Hewbrews did not recognize him he did not change his colour.

             P.S.  the second coming of christ could imply being spiritually awake in Christ consciousness with the energy of Ison  Ison is not a comet, comets dont orbit the sun.

             Christ said that what has been hidden shall be revealed, he also said that he never said anything in secret or hidden but always spoke openly and truthfully.

             Ive seen Jesus Christ in my dream actually it was my childhood wish to see him and to talk to him face to face. And that wish was fulfilled on April 26, 2014. When I open this up to someone she taught I was crazy she never believed me. About his real / exact image as Ive seen him he was good looking and very handsome. But no one can paint or draw his exact image because he doesnt want to be painted. He erased it from my mind same also to those people who saw him through visions or dreams. But if there is someone chosen who could paint him and I could see it I can tell if it is him (Jesus) or not. All of the pictures you see now isnt his exact image all of those was imaginations they keep on trying to figure out his face but couldnt.
             <br/>
             When you are with him you will feel peace and tranquility and you know that he isnt man. The person you are with isnt a man.NO ONE IS WORTHY to portray as him.

             Christ was a tall man,his white robe, had fair skin,
             <br/>
             a
             <br/>
             long nose,his eyes even if we talked face to face and eye to eye as he was holding my shoulders (so you can imagine how close we were that time) Im not
             <br/>
             certain of its color, auburn or brown
             <br/>
             colored
             <br/>
             hair parted in the middle and
             <br/>
             falling
             <br/>
             to his shoulders it was straight no curls , and a beard with
             <br/>
             a
             <br/>
             natural part at the chin, and a
             <br/>
             mustache that circled down to
             <br/>
             meet
             <br/>
             his beard .
             <br/>
             Note: most Jews
             <br/>
             have
             <br/>
             brown eyes, as did his mother
             <br/>
             Mary,
             <br/>
             but remember Christ was only half
             <br/>
             Jew, his Father, God the Father,
             <br/>
             was
             <br/>
             not a Jews.
             <br/>
             this is how I described Jesus in
             <br/>
             my dream but he was too
             <br/>
             handsome .

               His skin was like polished bronze(shiny tan maybe even a bit darker, not too much though)[Just look at the colors online for Burnished Bronze]

               Wool can also be wide curly hair which can in time get longer too as it curls. It can also be very soft or semi soft. Perhaps platinum plus type hair too.

             Hes wasnt Jewish, as that are the Jews mislabeling him; otherwise, they would have freed him from the bondage of Pilots sentencing him from the people over Barabbas to be exonerated. Jesus was an Israelite which I define as Heavenist. Translates superhuman god of the universe and king to a kingdom sovereignty of immoral light. A term never used on Earth before. Mary was not Jewish, his mother. She was Irish descendent that lived in Israel. We know and read a lot of information about Jesuss life, but we havent gathered enough sufficient details relevant about is mother, Marys past. Who was Marys mother? And where did Mary really come from before she gave birth to Christ in the New Testament years preceding her birth announcement after her sister Elizabeth with John the Baptist (Jesuss cousin)? It doesnt say and there is no record of Marys past even as a little girl of her younger life. She had bluish/hazel green eyes like the sea, there are no natural people ever in history that are not of Jewish bloodline with either blue or green eyes, either than Mary and her son Jesus passed down hereditarily to Christ. They were gentiles, outcasted migrated from another land or country to Israel. He had bluish/near hazel green if eyes. Blue is the color and symbol of Pisces.. the fish or Poseidon in Latin/Neptune of Roman Mythology also mysterious, yet enchantingly mystical. Im of Irish bloodline or druid. The druids were immortal children with supernatural power or energy (as seen in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys with Kevin Sorbo), some in the form of men because they have not sinned and are virgins, stereotyped and banished to have their share of adult manhood among immoral mankind, or reward for hard effort of work performed. Strange but CORY means Hollow in Hebrew Our father for art though in heaven. HOLLOWED BE THY NAME. And in English if you do a reverse-check CORY. Its me.

             Agreed, apart from the fact that Jesus was a muscular man. This would mean beauty, and Jesus was not beautiful, according to Isaiah. I have seen plenty of construction workers who are just thin, even though they are very strong from hard work. On the fact of Jesus being black, if He was, at least He was not a beautiful black man, since the Bible says He was not beautiful. So no beautiful skin color.

             People Yeshua  is his real name (Jesus) is a translation from Greek meaning 
             <br/>
             Zeus son first, the letter j wasnt invented until the 15th century
             <br/>
             way past the death and resurrection of Christ .Yeshusa is a African name
             <br/>
             Historical fact : blacks were the first race.. when we migrated further
             <br/>
             north our pigment changed due to harsh cold (cavemen ) ok so to break
             <br/>
             this down . Moses took the slaves to the promise land (Israel )from
             <br/>
             Egypt  at that time everybody was people of color . other then the ones
             <br/>
             who migrated up north and came back down to places like (Rome Greece
             <br/>
             ect) well while Moses was traveling we all know some didnt believe in
             <br/>
             the promise land and settled in various places like Ethiopia ect.( okay
             <br/>
             now  common sense has to play at some point . you have a country like
             <br/>
             Rome who RAPE &amp; PILLAGE ) so Moses makes it to the promised land
             <br/>
             and many years later the white complexion Romans mate, rape ..
             <br/>
             everything we already know .. and now the Jews are white or tan
             <br/>
             complexion over many many years  (remember Moses and Yeshua never shared
             <br/>
             the world together ) ok now we have young Yeshua (Jesus )born in Africa
             <br/>
             in the Tribe Of Judah (never seen a white man in a  Tribe before )
             <br/>
             studied in Egypt . Yeshua (Jesus) mission was to save who so ever
             <br/>
             believeth in him but more so to help his fellow Jews who lost their way.
             <br/>
             Think of todays society and race is our biggest issue for a reason 
             <br/>
             This Black man claiming he is the son of God in front of a bunch of
             <br/>
             noble white Jews. The end result ,the white jews could not accept a
             <br/>
             black God. But their was some whites who did  the Romans .. The
             <br/>
             Romans  After stealing killing murdering they came to the Glory of
             <br/>
             God  But as many dont know Constantine was of color and his roman
             <br/>
             follows would not follow a black Yeshua (jesus) so they changed his
             <br/>
             complexion to suit their congregation (their are black jesus photos
             <br/>
             older then Leonardos paitings) also the sabbath was changed as well to
             <br/>
             suit the work week (God put remember the sabbath and keep it holy for a
             <br/>
             reason friday noon to saturday not SUNDAY) Lord knew someone would
             <br/>
             change it (smh) See the is a relevance to the color of our savor is very
             <br/>
             important ( the meek shall inherit the earth ) if we knew that we been
             <br/>
             oppressed since the days of our Lord and savoir what would you think the
             <br/>
             outcome would be (the meek might have inhered the earth alot sooner)
             <br/>
             But he did come with the intention that race shouldnt matter (but God
             <br/>
             knows it matters) Black Fact : if we mate with any race we are the
             <br/>
             dominate gene thats because we all was the same race at one point
             <br/>
             .Deny that Have a blessed day !!!!

               There is absolutely no proof of this, and all this does is serve to offer up more rhetoric of race.  Jesus was not born in Africa.  We did not all start out as Africans OR APES.  Being brown or tanned skin does not MEAN or translate to BLACK.  This sounds like some black panther/Mendelian theory designed to turn people against the white race. It is like saying that Blacks were actually bred to be work horses, as the theory goes, and were not ever actually a race, but a cross breed for slavery.   Theories say, we have the same DNA make up as an ape, therefore man came from Ape.  PLEASE.

                 Lisa he is partly right. Israel is part of the Land of Ham or the so called Africa that was rename by a White Man name Scipio Africanus.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Name Middle East was invented by the Zionist and the Queen of England so she can politically get access to the Land of Israel for Political advantages.
                </p>
                <p>
                 AFRICA was not known as AFRICA in Biblical Times it was called the Land Of HAM.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Psalm 105:23
                 <br/>
                 23. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the LAND of HAM.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Later during the Roman empire  Scipio Africanus the Elder (Roman General) defeating Hannibal at the final battle of the Second Punic War at Zama. The Land of HAM was RENAME after Scipio Africanus in his Honor. Africa-nus AFRICA.

                 HAM  (hm, perhaps hot). 1. The youngest son of Noah, born probably about 96 years before the Flood; and one of eight persons to live through the Flood. He became the progenitor of the dark races; NOT THE NEGROES, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites (Gen. 10:6-20). 
                </p>
                <p>
                 Notice the Jewish scholars know that the so called NEGROES (So called African Americans) are not AFRICAN, but from the lineage of SHEM and not HAM like the Africans or Hamites.

             The Bible contains testimonies concerning God, and it proposes religious interpretations of historical and personal events. Are we in agreement so far?
            </p>
            <p>
             But, does it also contain only absolute truth without errors of any kind?
            </p>
            <p>
             If you say Yes, you have a lot of explaining to do.

               Yes, the problem is not in the bible, the problem is in the interpretation.  The bibles we read today, I personally only use the KJV, as the other version omit verses, change meanings, and change language.

             That picture above of Jesus is actually a fake! That was modelled on the son of a Pope, by the name of Cesare Borgia! as a jew and a member of the semitic tribes, he could be black or a negrense by complexion, and during palm Sunday, people had to  go on higher grounds to see him, meaning he was a short fellow, probably 53 or 54 in height!

               The image of Jesus was changed by Pope Alexander VI.  Prior to that the Christians were worshiping Jesus in his true image as a dark skinned man from the tribe of Judah.  There are still churches in Europe now that display Jesus and the Black Madonna, especially in France.

               The original Jewish nation fled to Africa.  The oldest Jewish communities on earth are located in Africa.  They are the true descendants of the land which is now called Israel.

                 Larry B there is truth in your words but it needs more truth. Your thinking of Ethiopia when the queen of the south came to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Remember brother Solomon people didnt want him to be with her so he sent her off with the best he has. But remember brother God has always kept a select few that where obedient in the promise land. Dont you know the Christian in Israel can trace their roots back to Jesus. Dont you know those people are the Palestinians. As far as the Jewish people you see today they arent real Jews. They trace their roots to Russia and Poland only a select few have that bloodline and they are the ones that control everything. Dont you know these people been a burden to the world. But God can be the only one to judge them. You see what happened in world war 1 and 2 which they manipulated to their favor. You can also see what happened to America as soon as we aligned ourselves with them the American dream died research what I say brother

                   First of all the name Africa was given to the continent by the Romans.  Africa was also called Kemet, Libya, Ortegia, Corphye, Egypt, ETHIOPIA and/or Sedan, Olympia, Hesperia, Oceania, and Ta-Merry.  I agree that some of the descendants are in what is now Palestine but many also fled to what is now called Africa.  When Jewish scholars want to trace their roots, they go to present day Africa. Americans and Europeans assume the Bible is about them but it is about African history.  I agree that we are definitely on the same page concerning what is happening with Israel/Palestine conflict.

                     Larry B you know your right!!!! My concern is we are not preaching the gospel to his true descendent we are so concerned with the Zionist regime. Larry B what do you think Jesus means when he refers to the people that calls themselves Jews but are in the synagogue of Satan? Larry B also I would love your opinion on the Talmud. Also do you think the Talmud is more important than the Torah? Lastly Jesus says the whole world would turn their backs on mystery Babylon. What does that mean in your opinion.

                     I just realized Larry how right you are, thank you so much for spreading light. How many times did the bible have its people flee to Africa. Even Jesus went to Africa when he was a little boy. I also realized when the Egyptian first saw white people they thought they were Gods. My point Alexander the great!!!

             Jewish people today arent the Jewish people in the bible nor do they follow the Torah. The Jews you see are of Russian and Polish decent. Thats why Jesus constantly says they call themselves Jews but are in the synagogue of Satan. Do your history searching on Christian Palestinians

This is how the creator did it.  90% of the worlds population are people of color.  Its a simple concept.  Race is a man-made concept.  It all began in Africa.  Wake up people!!!

              <p>
               53 Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things:
              </p>
              <p>
               54 And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hast chosen (Israelites).
              </p>
              <p>
               55 All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes (Israelites)
              </p>
              <p>
               56 As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.

             The image of Jesus was changed by Pope Alexander VI when Europe gained control of the Christian Church and changed the appearance of Jesus to be White.  Prior to this Jesus had been worshiped by all in his true form when he walked the earth.  Jesus was a dark skinned being we he walked this earth.  Its a no-brainer.

             I agree Jesus probably didnt look African, but he definitely didnt look European either! I am sure he was brownskinned and had course hair like everyone else in the region. I have been to Egypt and Jordan and most of the people there are as dark or darker than a Manila Envelope. I just think it scares SOME (not all) white people that Jesus could not look like a Bee Gee.

             For those of you who know of the original movie Guess Whos Coming to Dinner that is what the shock will be like. Jack hinted towards this very fact without saying it explicitly. Revelation (to reveal) gives a clear indication that Jesus was and is a Black man. Lets prepare everyone now by STOPPING the LIE and TELLING the TRUTH. If you are suppose to equip and encourage, stop being evasive. You expounded on what the scriptures said in Isaiah. You were shrewd/conniving (you choose) as far as Revelation is concerned.

             When you burn something it turns black. And dont say it doesnt matter what color he is because if it didnt matter then God would not have had the prophet describe him in detail, he wants you to know what he looks like!

             Many skeletons have been found of males who lived in the time of Jesus and in the same place as Jesus. They average 5 feet to 5 feet 3 inches. The typical male weighed between 100 and 103 pounds.

             Its not important. Its just that we know that he did not look like how he is so often portrayed in art or movies. Jesus message has nothing to do with his appearance.

             I think I may have been chosen to repair this broken earth, through my story the story of the truth. Im told no more lies, time for the liars to confess we must stop this violence and hate before we all die. I know all the secrets the lies and the hate, I found the cure for disease and happiness and ultimately life! I know the story of the bible and I have never read a single page, you are being fooled into lying and you are all stuck living an eternal sin here in hell on earth I am the Luke, I survived the mental torture the testing by telling the truth now I know everything the secrets and lies but i also hold the recipe for the cure. Look i made it look here its me, I know all the secrets better prepare your lies to tell. I know the solution to end all the hate, the lies are the evil stop them and stop lying tell the truth we have seen enough dieing!
             <br/>
             I have never been to church or such a place, I am 35 in September and I just felt as though someone is telling me all the truth in everybodys lies its as if I have never heard lies only the truth my whole life, I never thought of anything about religion but somehow I know what happened. I can write my life story into a bible that would be my life in a story the truth.

             Always remember Jews that descended from Babylon are Satanic worshipping and Illuminati secularists.. but if you are of Jewish bloodline separated from your good company because of your faith and reproached from their evil envy snaring group, disaffiliated from at your customs you are ISRAELITE, if you follow Christ who is the superhuman immortal king of the universe.. .then youve been reborn as a CHRISTILITE.

             Summary:
             <br/>
             Many
             <br/>
             of the maternal ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews were European
             <br/>
             converts, according to new research. Analysis of DNA samples has shown
             <br/>
             that on the female line, the Ashkenazim are descended not from the Near
             <br/>
             East but from southern and western Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many of the maternal
             <br/>
             ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews were European converts, according to a
             <br/>
             research project headed by a University of Huddersfield professor.
             <br/>
             The
             <br/>
             young science of archaeogenetics has been used to settle a
             <br/>
             long-standing controversy  the origin of Europes Ashkenazi Jews. Are
             <br/>
             they principally descended from forbears who migrated from Palestine in
             <br/>
             the first century AD? Or were their ancestors Europeans who converted to
             <br/>
             Judaism?
             <br/>
             A new article in the leading journal Nature Communications
             <br/>
             claims to have settled the question. Analysis of DNA samples has shown
             <br/>
             that on the female line, the Ashkenazim are descended not from the Near
             <br/>
             East but from southern and western Europe.
             <br/>
             Professor Martin Richards
             <br/>
             heads the Archaeogenetics Research Group based at the University of
             <br/>
             Huddersfield and he is a co-author of the new article, entitled A
             <br/>
             substantial prehistoric European ancestry amongst Ashkenazi maternal
             <br/>
             lineages.
             <br/>
             In Hebrew, the word Ashkenazi means Germans and the
             <br/>
             term is used for Jews of eastern European origin who historically spoke
             <br/>
             the Yiddish or Judeo-German language. Professor Richards says that the
             <br/>
             new explanation for their origins was one of the most significant
             <br/>
             findings from a wider project in which he and his colleagues 
             <br/>
             principally the Portuguese PhD students Marta Costa and Joana Pereira 
             <br/>
             were analysing mitochondrial DNA samples (i.e. DNA that traces the
             <br/>
             maternal line) in order to investigate the prehistoric settlement of
             <br/>
             Europe by migrants from the Near East.
             <br/>
             Ashkenazi Jewish lineages were
             <br/>
             among the large quantity of publicly available mitochondrial genomes of
             <br/>
             people from Europe, the Caucasus and the Middle East that entered the
             <br/>
             analysis. It was discovered that in the vast majority of cases,
             <br/>
             Ashkenazi lineages are most closely related to those of southern and
             <br/>
             western Europe and that they had been present in Europe for many
             <br/>
             thousands of years.
             <br/>
             This suggests that, even though Jewish men may
             <br/>
             indeed have migrated into Europe from Palestine around 2000 years ago,
             <br/>
             they seem to have married European women, states Professor Richards.
             <br/>
             This
             <br/>
             seems to have happened first along the Mediterranean, especially in
             <br/>
             Italy, and later  but probably to a lesser extent  in western and
             <br/>
             central Europe. This suggests that, in the early years of the Diaspora,
             <br/>
             Judaism took in many converts from amongst the European population, but
             <br/>
             they were mainly recruited from amongst women. Thus, on the female line
             <br/>
             of descent, the Ashkenazim primarily trace their ancestry neither to
             <br/>
             Palestine nor to Khazaria in the North Caucasus  as has also been
             <br/>
             suggested  but to southern and western Europe.
             <br/>
             The origins of the
             <br/>
             Ashkenazim is one of the big questions that people have pursued again
             <br/>
             and again and never really come to a conclusive view, said Prof
             <br/>
             Richards, who has described the new data as compelling.

               <br/>
               doors that were shut by convention; requiring scholars and theologians
               <br/>
               to redefine the very roots of their beliefs.
               <br/>
               If Jesus, in actuality
               <br/>
               was Tutankhamun, then I just had to ask the $64 thousand question, who
               <br/>
               then was the Jesus that Christians believe was crucified in the 1st
               <br/>
               century AD by the Romans? Osman replied matter-of-factly,the gospels of
               <br/>
               the Nag Hammadi do not talk of a crucifixion under Pontius Pilate,
               <br/>
               neither does St Paul in any of his letters. Some Gnostics believe it was
               <br/>
               someone else, someone called Simon, who was killed on that occasion.
               <br/>
               But then Osman astonishes me with what he says next.However, I do
               <br/>
               believe that Jesus died on the cross, not the Roman cross, but the
               <br/>
               Egyptian ankh cross. All ancient Egyptian kings are believed to have
               <br/>
               been sacrificed on this cross. Though crucifixion on this cross only
               <br/>
               means physical death, not spiritual.The ankh was a symbol, not of death,
               <br/>
               but of life, and it is the ankh that was used by all Christians until
               <br/>
               the 4th century when the Vatican introduced the Roman cross for the
               <br/>
               first time. Even the cross that is reported to have been seen by
               <br/>
               Constantine, the cross that foreshadowed his conversion, represented the
               <br/>
               Egyptian ankh.

               First
               <br/>
               mistake European corruption of after Nicaea. It was an African bishop
               <br/>
               Athanasius who defended the trinity, against the Arians, who was started
               <br/>
               by Arius also an African bishop. Second after the council of Nicaea and
               <br/>
               Constantine, there the Third African Pope a saint as well Pope St.
               <br/>
               Gelasius I. So how was there a European corruption of Christianity? Look
               <br/>
               at the similarities between the ancient church in Ethiopia and Eritrea

               There is no debate about genetic if you know your Torah, the Hebrew were

               a mixed genetic group from the beginning. Too many speak on this topic
               <br/>
               and do not read the Torah. Abraham is from Syria, he went into Egypt and
               <br/>
               his people were slaves for 400 years. Joseph is great grandson who was

               married to an Egyptian and had mixed children. The children of Israel
               <br/>

               The 600,000

             While I agree that there is no way Jesus/Yeshua had long hair, I believe that Isaiah 53, aside from revealing that He did not have what we would call outstanding features, also reveals that neither was His form lovely, that is He probably was not tall nor big/built. He was in every physical way non-impressive. That is the clear meaning of the Scripture. Also the above description in Revelation is clearly heavily symbolic, not literal. It states that his head and hair were white as wool, not woolly. Not blond, not brunette, not black, WHITE like snow. Also I find the comments below about the Jews heavily anti-Semitic which seems ironic given that they are made, for the most part, by those who are accusing others of being racist in their interpretations of what Yeshua looked like. Rev 2 and 3 do not say that ALL Jews are of the synagogue of Satan but the ones being referred to in these passages. Clearly the writers of the Old and New Covenant Scriptures (with the possible exception of Dr. Luke) were all Jews as was Yeshua, and while some of their (the Jews) descendants have been scattered throughout the world, some have returned to Israel in these last days, from the nations and Yeshua will continue to bring more of them back to their land and then He will come to defend and deliver them from the nations who will oppose them as prophesied. The Jewish people are meticulous record-keepers so that many know who they are descended from and whether they are from the tribe of Yehudah, or Levi etc. Some of the Jewish people are indeed black, and some are brown, and some may even be, gasp, whitish, but the New Covenant was made with the house of Judah and with the house of Israel (Jeremiah 31:31) The good news of the gospel of Gods Kingdom is that any Gentile can be grafted in by the blood of the Jewish Messiah Yeshua. Stop with the anti-Israel sentiments because they are Jesus brethren!

               In

               While, not as accurate as some methods, because of migration. It can be
               <br/>
               used to prove connections and interactions with groups. Africa, itself
               <br/>
               has yet to be studied as vigorously as other Afro-Asiatic languages such
               <br/>
               as the Semitic languages. Which, in turn can leave a lack of
               <br/>
               understanding of the true connection between Afro-Asiatic groups.

               In
               <br/>
               contrast to the Indo-European Language Family, about which much
               <br/>
               research has been done over the past two centuries, relatively little is
               <br/>
               known about the former Hamito-Semitic Language Family, now known as the
               <br/>
               Afro-Asiatic Family.(hile much research has been accomplished with the
               <br/>
               Semitic Languages because of Arabic and Hebraic religious ties, little
               <br/>
               has been done with the Afro-Asiatic family as a whole.) This paper will
               <br/>
               describe this language family as is current with modern scholarly
               <br/>
               thought, and will also acknowledge current research having to do with
               <br/>
               the Afro-Asiatic Family.
              </p>
              <p>
               This family spreads itself over the
               <br/>
               northern third of Africa and into western Asia (also known as the Near

               East), and 175 million people speak languages that belong to this family
               <br/>
               (Ruhlen 1987:86). It is thought to be the parent of at least 250
               <br/>
               languages (Bomhard and Kearns 1994:24). The name Hamito-Semitic was
               <br/>
               applied to describe the two main phyla (Hamitic and Semitic) that
               <br/>
               philologists of African languages connected in the late nineteenth and
               <br/>
               early twentieth centuries. The Hamitic branch included Ancient Egyptian
               <br/>
               (an extinct language known as Coptic in its final stages), Berber, and
               <br/>
               Cushitic, while the Semitic branch included the well-documented Arabic,
               <br/>
               Hebrew, and Akkadian.(More will be said about these phyla shortly.) In
               <br/>
               1949 American linguist Joseph H. Greenberg drew different lines in
               <br/>
               Afro-Asiatic classification. He showed that the Hamitic languages did
               <br/>
               not bear enough resemblance to be classified as one subgroup, but that
               <br/>
               each of the three (Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic) constituted its own
               <br/>
               subgroup. Thus the name Hamitic was no longer valid and possibly
               <br/>
               racist (Ruhlen 1987:82). He therefore coined Afro-Asiatic as the name
               <br/>
               for this family. It included the six groups Ancient Egyptian, Omotic,
               <br/>
               Cushitic, Semitic, Berber, and Chadic,

             Samson WAS black, the bible clearly states he had dreadlocks. Non blacks
             <br/>
             cannot have locs naturally, because they do not possess the coily and
             <br/>
             kinky texture of afro hair. Samson never touched his hair and it was
             <br/>
             never touched (till Delilah came around) because it was his source of
             <br/>
             strength, which is why it makes sense that his hair became locs. When
             <br/>
             Afro hair is left overtime, it naturally locs itself. Straight hair
             <br/>
             cannot do this. People need to understand that Christianity of today has
             <br/>
             been europeanised. Black people were the original.

             Anyone whos said Jesus has appeared to them whether in a dream or in person literally has stated that he looks exactly like Akiane Kramariks Prince of Peace painting below. This painting matches up to the image on the Shroud of Turin, I also recommend checking out the History channel documentary the real face of Jesus.

                   Are you an Idol worshipper? did I offend your White Picture god? Then you should be ashamed of yourself for spreading that LIE, saying its the image of the Messiah.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Exodus 20:3-6
                   <br/>
                   3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that HATE me;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that LOVE me, and keep my commandments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So that Picture was made by MAN or in this case a little girl who said she envision him which is ALL LIES.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Only a gullible person who do not keep Gods LAWS would fall for that MESS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And you BET I HATE IDOLS and I HATE LIES from the DEVIL. If you do not have HATE towards SIN then you are an Enemy of the Most High God because GOD himself HATE SINS and IDOLS or FALSE IMAGES created by man. And instead of promoting that Lying Picture you should be TEARING it UP and accept the TRUE GOD of ISRAEL and Have no Other gods beside HIM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Picture you are posting there, is a picture of an Italian Roman man name Cesare Borgia. He was the son of Pope Alexander VI. This man is the wickedest man to be painted by his homosexual partner Michel Angelo. He had incest with his sister and killed his Brother. He did things that were unthinkable and was very disgusting and nasty and you want to called him the Son of God? BLASPHEMY!!!!!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Why do you think the Catholic Priests have Immunity to molest little boys and why do you think the Catholic have Money from your collections and paychecks to pay off the parents who complain about their sons being molested resulting in the case being swept under the RUG. Then they remove the offending priest to another Catholic Church to continue molesting more little boys. Is that the god you serve?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have a CHALLENGE for you: If you can show me a SCRIPTURE in the BIBLE that describe the Messiah as that PICTURE you are promoting, then I WILL DELETE this ACCOUNT, Paypal you all my income from all of my bank accounts and empty them into your account and Make a PUBLIC APOLOGY and ASK for Your FORGIVENESS and become your TOP PROMOTER in promoting your Picture saying this is the CHRIST.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I CHALLENGE you by the Word of God.

                     THE ZONDERVAN COMPACT BIBLE DICTIONARY

                    <p>
                     HAM  (hm, perhaps hot). 1. The youngest son of Noah, born probably about 96 years before the Flood; and one of eight persons to live through the Flood. He became the progenitor of the DARK races; NOT THE NEGROES, but the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Libyans and Canaanites (Gen. 10:6-20). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     NOTICE that Zondervan mention the DARK RACES; Hinting that the Israelites who they called NEGROES are a Dark Race of People also, but are not included in the lineage of HAM, because they (The NEGROES) are a Dark Race People which are from SHEM, The oldest son of Noah.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Since the Egyptians were DARK race people and Egypt is in Africa, which the original land mass or map would show that it include also the land of CANAAN: which includes Jerusalem, Israel and all of Judea is Africas Land or The Land of HAM.

                     PSALM 105:23
                     <br/>
                     23. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of HAM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     PSALM 106:22
                     <br/>
                     22. Wondrous works in the land of HAM, and terrible things by the Red sea.

                     PSLAM 78:51
                     <br/>
                     51. And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of HAM:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     THE LAND OF HAM RENAME to AFRICA
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Romans conquered the Land of Ham and rename it Africa after a Roman General name Scipio Africa-nus, after defeating Hannibal at the final battle of the Second Punic War at Zama on October 19, 202 BC. So the Romans had Jurisdiction all over Northern Africa including the land of Canaan which includes Jerusalem and all of Judea and Asia Minor which is part of the land of Ham.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Facts: The Romans and Edomites are the so called:
                     <br/>
                     (White People).
                     <br/>
                     If you look at an ancient Roman coin of Julius Caesar
                     <br/>
                     You would see that he was a (Caucasian man) like King Herod his kin an Edomite also a (Caucasian man aka Whiteman).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In ancient history the Jews were also known to be Dark Skin People, because they were always mistaken for Egyptian People.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Apostle Paul a Jew mistaken for an Egyptian
                     <br/>
                     ACTS 21:38
                     <br/>
                     38. Art not thou that EGYPTIAN, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So here we see the chief captain of the Roman guards thought Paul was an Egyptian because of his DARK SKIN COLOR until Paul open his mouth and spoke greek to him because Paul was a Roman Citizen but a Jew by birth. Just like in America there are many citizens who are from varies countries of the world like a Japanese American, but their homeland is in Japan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Joseph mistaken for an Egyptian -
                     <br/>
                     Even his brothers didnt recognized him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, from the twelve tribes of Israel, was sold to some Ishmaelites by his brothers out of anger. The Ishmaelites took Joseph into Egypt and sold him to the Egyptians. Later a famine had struck the land of Egypt and Canaan and according to the Bible all the lands were very devastating. Jacob instructed several of his sons to go into Egypt and buy food because Egypt had enough to sell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When the brothers of Joseph, the sons of Jacob had entered the land of Egypt, they were told to see a particular person. Not knowing who the individual was they were going to see, when they faced him, they didnt RECONGNIZE him, but Joseph recognized them. If Joseph is supposed to be a white person, and he was in the mist of black people, dont you think his brothers would have recognized him immediately. Why didnt his brothers recognize him immediately? Could it have been due to him being black amongst black people and he blended in?
                     <br/>
                     A white person definitely would have been able to be pointed out if he was amongst black slaves during slavery time. Dont you think?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Moses mistaken for Pharaohs Grandson.
                     <br/>
                     Even Pharaoh didnt RECOGNIZE Moses as an Israelite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     While the Israelites were living in the land of Egypt, Pharaoh had commanded for all the Israelite males to be exterminated. Now during this time, a couple from the Israelite people had borne a son, and they had hid him for three months. When they couldnt hide him no longer, she put the child into a basket and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. The daughter of Pharaoh, wanting to bathe in the Nile, went to the banks and saw the basket among the reeds and when she opened the basket she saw a baby in it. Being that the baby was very young, she instructed a Hebrew family, coincidently the babys mother, to nurse the child until he was weaned. Once he was weaned, she brought the boy to her father and asked if she could keep the child, and her father said yes. Also, the baby was named Moses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Remembering that the Egyptians were black, if Moses was white and knowing that Pharaoh had issued a decree to kill all the Hebrew males, wouldnt he have killed Moses immediately when she brought this supposedly white child into her fathers house? Also, if he was white, do you think Pharaohs daughter would have even let the child live when she found him by the Nile? Obviously we must say no.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Finally, Moses lived amongst the Egyptians for years and one day when he saw an Egyptian abusing a Hebrew, he came to the aide of the Hebrew and killed the Egyptian. Knowing that the word would get out and back to Pharaoh, he fled Egypt and went to the land of Midian. Upon entering Midian he came to the aide of some women of the land and helped them. They were very grateful and ran back and told their father that an Egyptian saved them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     EXODUS 2:19
                     <br/>
                     19. And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Again, if he was mistaking for an Egyptian, and knowing that the Egyptians are supposedly dark-skinned people, does this make Moses dark-skinned too?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Here is a Historical record that you can find in your Library.
                     <br/>
                     Herodotus (484? -425? BC) was one of the most widely traveled people of his time. His writings show his interest in both history and geography. Herodotus was born in Halicarnassus, a Greek colony in Asia Minor. He was a frequent visitor to Athens, he was a close friend of Sophocles. He also journeyed to the western shores of the Black Sea, to southern Italy and Egypt, and to the Asian cities of Tyre, Babylon, Ecbatana, Nineveh, and Susa, says the Comptons Interactive encyclopedia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     During his travels, Herodotus kept a journal of his activities. The journal was later translated, and in one of his entries, he wrote the following about the Egyptians or to be more exact the natives:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      it is certain that the natives of the country are black . . . ; there can be no doubt that the Colchians are an Egyptians race . . . I made this inquiries on the subject both in Colchis and in Egypt, and I found that the Colchians had a more distinct recollection of the Egyptians, than the Egyptians had of them . . . My own conjectures were founded, first, on the fact that they are black-skinned and have woolly hair . . . 
                     <br/>
                     This is Public Historical record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     LEVITICUS 25:38
                     <br/>
                     38. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Ham. Ham signifies burnt or black; and this name was peculiarly significant of the regions allotted to his family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     To the Cushites, or descendants of Cush, were allotted the hot southern regions of Asia, along the shores of the Persian Gulf, Susiana or Chusistan, etc.;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     To the sons of Canaan, Palestine and Syria in Africa; to the sons of Mizraim, Egypt and Libya. Now remember that these are DARK SKIN PEOPLE who are Descendants from DARK SKIN HAM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Herod the Great was kin to the Romans. He was an edomite (Caucasian Man). He was a Roman client king of Judea. When he heard that a king was to be born, he wanted to kill all the babies in Bethlehem, Today it is a Palestinian city located in the central West Bank, about six miles south of Jerusalem all of this was the land of Canaan which is a Son of HAM which dwell in the Land of HAM given to his sons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     MATTHEW 2:13
                     <br/>
                     13. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now since we have established that the Israelites are NOT Edomites or Romans (Caucasian People) and the Israelites look like Egyptians (Dark Skin People) then it would be possible for Joseph and his wife Mary and the baby Messiah to hide among the Egyptians who are Dark Skin People and avoid King Herod from finding them among the Africans called the Egyptians.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     AMOS 9:7
                     <br/>
                     7. Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel?
                     <br/>
                     The Ethiopians were children of HAM a DARK SKIN RACE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     HOSEA 11:1
                     <br/>
                     1. When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my SON out of Egypt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     MATTHEW 2:13
                     <br/>
                     13. take the young CHILD and his MOTHER, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It would be impossible for a White couple with child to hide among Dark Skin People because they would stick out like a SORE Thumb. It doesnt take a Rocket Scientist to figure this out  even a 5th Grader would tell you the same thing that the Israelites were Dark Skin People like the Egyptians. Therefore Mary an Israelite a JEW was a Dark Skin Woman.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Even the Roman Catholic Church have some intelligence to know that the Ancient Israelites and Jews are Dark Skin People, since they have in their possession most of the original records and ancient manuscripts of these people.

                    <p>
                     Now I do not advocate that you worship Mary or pray to her because that would be committing Idolatry. This was just meant to show that the Popes knew that The Messiah and his Mother were Dark Skin People like the Egyptians.

                     Pick up a book and read and maybe you might get lucky to realized there is a Bible Dictionary Book by Zondervan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It makes me sad, when our children failed to read and do their own research instead of watching television about junk and playing rock and rap music that makes no sense at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Then you wont hear this ignorant statement Zondervan? Never heard of it. Egyptians arent black. You fail, racist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Hmmm Hello? You on the internet; Have you ever heard of something called Google? Maybe Google is a myth too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Do these African Egyptians look white to you?

                     These are the pure Egyptians who were not raped by the Arabs or Whiteman. Can you see the resembling with the NEGROES in America? Look at the AFRO HAIR do White People have AFRO Woolly Hair? NOT!!!

                     King Tut doesnt look white in this picture. 20 years from now you going to sware to your kids that Malcolm X was White too.

                     Galatians 5:22-23  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control You seem to be lacking in all the above. When you can show love to people of all ethnic backgrounds instead of hate, then Ill debate you. I will not apologize for posting Akiane Kramariks Prince of Peace painting of Jesus, because this picture matches exactly to the Shroud of Turin which is the burial cloth of Jesus  and because I did nothing wrong. If anyone should apologize &amp; asking for forgiveness it should be you for your hateful &amp; hurtful rhetoric.

                    <p>
                     Question: Do you know what the meaning of Spirit according to scripture means?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Spirit means the Word of God and this is what gives Life everlasting. The Holy Spirit is also the Word of GOD and the Word of God is his Laws, Statutes and Commandments  You see how they are all the same and alike? The Spirit and the Word of God are one and the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     John 6:63
                     <br/>
                     63. It is the SPIRIT that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are SPIRIT, and they are LIFE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Romans 7:14
                     <br/>
                     14. For we know that the LAW is SPIRITUAL:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     1 John 3:24
                     <br/>
                     24. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the SPIRIT (Word of God) which he hath given us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So if you have the Word of God in you which is his Laws, Statutes and Commandments then you will produce the fruits of the Commandments which is Spirit.

                     You must be a troll and obviously feed off of arguing with people dont you?  Dont go quoting scripture to me where youve clearly read and misinterpreted it out of context by not going back to the Hebrew &amp; Greek without divine guidance from the Holy Spirit, and instead only used your own understanding just like how Satan did when he tempted Christ. You do NOT operate out of a spirit of love, you operate out of a spirit of HATE, and youve got nothing go back and re-read 1 Cor 13. If you operated out of love you wouldnt be making racist &amp; hateful posts like you &amp; others from the Black Hebrew Israelite cult have been on here. Btw, since youre acting like youre so knowledgeable about the scriptures how about if you explain to me the true meaning of Psalm 82? I bet like every other Christian you will not be able to do that.

                     Also for someone ripping me for believing Man not God, youre doing the same thing by believing a man Luigi Garlaschelli instead of God, for every scientist you can find claiming the Shroud of Turin is fake, I can find just as many scientists claiming its authentic.

                     Palms 82 Explains for Dummies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Lets start with a look at Psalm 82, the psalm that Yasha quotes in John 10:34. The Hebrew word translated gods in Psalm 82:6 is Elohim. It usually refers to the one true God, but it does have other uses. Psalm 82:1 says, God presides in the great assembly; he gives judgment among the gods. It is clear from the next three verses that the word gods refers to magistrates, judges, and other people who hold positions of authority and rule. Calling a human magistrate a god indicates three things: 1) he has authority over other human beings, 2) the power he wields as a civil authority is to be feared, and 3) he derives his power and authority from God Himself, who is pictured as judging the whole earth in verse 8.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This use of the word gods to refer to humans is rare, but it is found elsewhere in the Old Testament. For example, when God sent Moses to Pharaoh, He said, See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh (Exodus 7:1). This simply means that Moses, as the messenger of God, was speaking Gods words and would therefore be Gods representative to the king. The Hebrew word Elohim is translated judges in Exodus 21:6 and 22:8, 9, and 28.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The whole point of Psalm 82 is that earthly judges must act with impartiality and true justice, because even judges must stand someday before the Judge. Verses 6 and 7 warn human magistrates that they, too, must be judged: I said, `You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High. But you will die like mere men; you will fall like every other ruler. This passage is saying that God has appointed men to positions of authority in which they are considered as gods among the people. They are to remember that, even though they are representing God in this world, they are mortal and must eventually give an account to God for how they used that authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now, lets look at how Yasha uses this passage. Yasha had just claimed to be the Son of God (John 10:25-30). The unbelieving Jews respond by charging Yasha with blasphemy, since He claimed to be God (verse 33). Jesus then quotes Psalm 82:6, reminding the Jews that the Law refers to mere menalbeit men of authority and prestigeas gods. Yasha point is this: you charge me with blasphemy based on my use of the title Son of God; yet your own Scriptures apply the same term to magistrates in general. If those who hold a divinely appointed office can be considered gods, how much more can the One whom God has chosen and sent (verses 34-36)

                     . I dont have a problem with the Bible what I have a problem with is people like you twisting Gods words out context to fit your racist and hateful agenda.  FYI: my ancestors never burned crosses nor denied anyone a job based on skin color also they never lived in the South nor owned slaves; my ancestors were poor sheepherders from Wales on my paternal side and dirt poor farmers from Slovakia on my maternal side.  So please stop flipping the script and playing the victim while being extremely racist and stereotyping all of us European descent. Youre the one who needs to apologize and ask forgiveness for your racist hatred.

                     You are Waaaaay off on Psalm 82
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Dr Michael Heiser does not keep the commandments of God so how can he have an understanding of it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Angels are not gods because when Daniel try to worship one of them they DENIED HIM and said Please do not do that because we are your fellow SERVANTS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Hebrews 2:7
                     <br/>
                     7. Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     When The Messiah comes back, we will be Like him in GLORY and Crown greater than the angels in Honor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You European dont understand the Scriptures for it was NEVER meant for you, but the Children of ISRAEL who keeps his Commandments can Understand it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Psalm 111:10
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     All European descent are ESAU
                     <br/>
                     Romans 9:13
                     <br/>
                     13. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but ESAU have I HATED.
                     <br/>
                     Hebrews 12:16
                     <br/>
                     16. Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Most High Does not just punish individuals but he punish a NATION as a Whole like he punish Israel into slavery when my Ancestors went into slavery for not Keeping the Laws, Statutes and Commandments. The Good and the BAD all went into Slavery as a Nation. So Esau as a Nation all European descent will be destroyed and the Good ones will go into Slavery as Servants and Handmaids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Isaiah 14:1-2
                     <br/>
                     1. For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     2. And the people shall TAKE them, and BRING them to THEIR PLACE: and the house of Israel shall POSSESS them in the LAND of the LORD for SERVANTS and HANDMAIDS: and they shall TAKE them CAPTIVES, whose CAPTIVES they were; and they shall RULE over their OPPRESSORS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Havent the Blacks here in AMERICA been OPPRESSED by Your EUROPEAN PEOPLE and Still being OPPRESSED to this very DAY? WE going to be your Masters in the KINGDOM of THE LORD on that Day when he comes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Obediah 1:10
                     <br/>
                     10. For thy VIOLENCE against thy brother Jacob SHAME (Slavery) shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.(Destruction)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Isaiah 14:21
                     <br/>
                     21. Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor POSSESS the LAND, nor FILL the FACE of the WORLD with CITIES.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Every where you European go you destroy a Nation and build up your Cities and FILL the face of their land with more European Faces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Remember when Israel went into Slavery under the Babylonians? Didnt Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel and the Three Hebrew boys and many other righteous men all went into Slavery with the bad ones. The Lord Punish Israel as a Nation. The only difference between the Good Israelites and the Bad Israelites was the Good Israelites was Shown Mercy and Favor among the Enemies.

                     There you go again twisting the Scriptures to fit your own racist agenda. And you massively failed to understand Psalm 82 by going to man-made interpretations instead of going back to the Biblical Hebrew like Dr Heiser did, and Im sure you also subscribe to sons of Seth theory in regards to Genesis 6:1-4.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Because I feel sorry for how badly deceived you are, Ill throw you one bone of truth:  Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Esau; HOWEVER, the rest of Europeans such as those who descended from the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc descend from Biblical Israelites. FYI: my people arent oppressing your people, its Ashkenazi Jews that are, just as theyre doing the same to my people.  Btw, the BHI cult does NOT fulfill the blessings, nor do they have any family heraldry to prove descent from any of the tribes of Israel (Num 2:2) unlike individuals of European descent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Look pal, I see right through you as clear as glass, and all you are is a mind-controlled disinformation agent trying to sow discord within the body of Christ and believe me you will be judged accordingly for your hateful and racist rhetoric while manipulating &amp; twisting Gods word to your own selfish agenda.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Like I said Im done, you better just agree to disagree with me, move on and find some other weak minded idiot to deceive.

                    <p>
                     I have a CHALLENGE for you before EVERYONE Here:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Prove to me that the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc FULFILL the CURSES of Deuteronomy 28: 15-68
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     For the Most High said that the TRUE Hebrew Israelites would be MARK with these CURSES as a SIGN that they are the REAL Israelites
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Deuteronomy 28:45-46, 68
                     <br/>
                     45. Moreover all these CURSES shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     46. And they shall be upon thee for a SIGN and for a WONDER, and upon thy SEED for EVER.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     68. And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with SHIPS, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be SOLD unto your enemies for BONDMEN and BONDWOMEN, and no man shall buy you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     SHOW me these CURSES on Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Did the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc go on Slave Trade Ships and were Sold to the Europeans White Man as Bondman and BondWomen? Did the  Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc Children were split up and sold all over the World to never be seen again? Were the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc called Bywords like Niggers and many other hateful words?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Are the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc People without a Country? without their Language? Without their Culture? at the Bottom of Society?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc are not BLESS because they have all the WEALTH they have STOLEN from Other Nations and Rape and Rob Nations because of it. I DO NOT call Robbing , Killing and Raping Nations a BLESSING.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So Prove to Us all that The Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc Fits the CURSES of Deuteronomy 28:15-68 and I WILL DELETE this ACCOUNT, Paypal you all my income from all of my bank accounts and empty them into your account and Make a PUBLIC APOLOGY and ASK for Your FORGIVENESS and become your TOP PROMOTER in promoting your Picture saying this is the CHRIST.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Its Best that you bail out gracefully because you cannot Prove that the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Slavs, Scandinavians, Goths, Jutesetc FITS the CURSES of Deuteronomy 28:15-68. because you are not the REAL JEWS or ISRAELITES.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     HOWEVER, Your People do fit the FAKE JEWS in Revelation 2:9 and 3:9
                     <br/>
                     2:9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the BLASPHEMY of THEM which SAY they are JEWS, and are NOT, but are the synagogue of SATAN.
                     <br/>
                     3.9. Behold, I will make THEM of the synagogue of SATAN, which SAY they are JEWS, and are NOT, but do LIE; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have LOVED thee.

                     If you look at whats happening in traditionally white European countries youll see the curses from Deutoronomy being fulfilled:  like the genocide of the white Dutch Afrikanners in South Africa, or how about taking a look at the black on white crime here in the US like with the murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome who were tortured &amp; murdered just because they were white while out on a date and had done nothing wrong. Or how about the UK is being flooded with Muslims where in Rotherham where 1400 white children between 1997-2013 were sexually molested, raped, beaten and trafficked by Muslim rape gangs. Should I mention that white eastern european women are sold into human trafficking prostitution rings in the modern state of Israel? Or how about the US is being invaded by disease infested illegals from Mexico and Central America? Not to mention the MONETARY DEBT SLAVERY that white European countries including the USA are under due to the Rothschild control of the money supply along with the Ashkenazi Jewish control of the media. And right now the people of European descent are reaping the curses because they are the physical descendants of the tribes of Israel and because they have not been following the Fathers commandments. I could go &amp; on, and this is all the present day stuff going on and doesnt even include the blessings &amp; curse fulfillment from history past.

                     You havent Showed me YET The White Europeans as a Nation all gone or going into SLAVERY on SHIPS and being Sold TO BLACK PEOPLE as BONDMAN or BONDWOMAN ( Do you see White People walking around with chains around their ankles and necks calling the Black Man Master?) or that Black PEOPLE Ruling the EARTH TODAY RIGTH NOW  YOU FAILED Miserably!

                     You Europeans are a JOKE. SMH
                     <br/>
                     Your European Kingdoms are coming to an End like Daniel Prophesied. So be prepared to be SERVANTS and HANDMAIDS in the NEW Kingdom to Come. Get your Plowshare Pimp up as in Pimp my Plowshare, because you going to WORK in the fields and Farmlands for the LORD.

                     If I were you I would be picking up books and googling the Internet on how to be the BEST Cotton Picker in the Field for the New Kingdom and If anyone refuse to pick cotton the Lord will put you down like a dog. Amen

                     Yet you CANNOT PROVE that your people fulfill the BLESSINGS as well nor do they have the family heraldry. With the direction things are going, white people will be on the bottom of society.

                     I never said Our PEOPLE fulfill any BLESSINGS because WE didnt OBEY the Commandments of GOD is the REASON why WE are under the CURSES of Deuteronomy 28:15-68.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So the MOST HIGH God did not REWARD us with the BLESSINGS but the CURSES.

                    <p>
                     AS I SAID before, What Columbus did to the Native Americans and you Whites did to the Black Jews is not GODs BLESSINGS to YOU.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Only GOD that BLESS YOU for ROBBING, KILLING, STEALING and RAPING other NATIONS is the DEVIL himself and that is the Europeans god that they do WORSHIP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The European Worship SATAN as their GOD that is WHY JOB Prophesied that the EARTH is given into the Hands of the WICKED. You Europeans are the Wicked who are ruling the EARTH right now under SATAN your gods Authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     JOB 9:24

                    <p>
                     24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     That is why Daniel prophesied about your Kingdoms coming to an END a Stone cut without Hand will Smash the 10 Toes of the Statue of the European Kingdoms that will fall to the ground into pieces and the wind blew it all away, which represent all the European Kingdoms that have rulership on the earth now will be destroyed at the coming of the Black Messiah and then the Kingdom of God will be setup like a Mountain.

             I have had many visions and dreams. I saw a commercial plane careening toward the street the day before the planes hit. I have had a rapture vision. Ive seen the Lord 3 times. The last time that I saw Him He was huge in comparison to the earth. The earth looked to be the size of a basketball to Him. I saw mostly His left side of His face and most of His body. He looked EXACTLY like Akianes drawing of Him when she was 8 years old. He Jesus/Yehsua is coming back soon!

             I think ppl need to focus more on living for him and stop worrying about his color. White, black, purple. He created this earth and created all of us. No body better then anyone else. U can not prove his color unless u have saw him. Im white and I have nothing to do with slavery or any other crime a white man has done before my time. Bible says we are all born in sin. That means black people 2. He died for our sins. So we all can be saved. Think its so funny somebody trying to preach against racism and sound so racist

             I dont have pictures of Jesus , if the Lord wanted you to know what He looked like Im sure they could manage a picture or a good word illustration. i wish they would do more paintings of black Jesus, Asian Jesus, etc etc. Bc Jesus was a Jew but for all of us we are made in His image it would be nice for people to understand that it doesnt matter. Personally I think it would sort the real believers from the bigots and anti-semites that hide in the church. Black Jesus love it.

             i have been reading about this for a week now. I think this is the stupidest and hate filled thing ever. Was jesus black or dark skinned more thank likely due to the region he lived in. This is were it is stupid and hate filled 1) The God of Abraham is a God of unlimted love and mercy. 2) Jesus is God in the flesh so Jesus is unlimted love and mercy. That type of God will not pick and choose salvation based on skin color. And how do we know Jesus was born black or brown his mother was hebrew his father the devine spirit. Jesus came from the house of israel and from the seed of the devine spirit that is God. Not the seed of a male of the 12 tribes. Just because God says he hates a certain nation it doesnt have the same meaning as when a man hates. God hates with perfect love he only hates his laws being broken. Man hates with malice in his heart towards his fellow man. I fell sorry for people saying salvation is based on the fact if you guess jesuss skin tone correctly. Becuase God nor jesus ever said salvation is based on guessing the correct skin tune. I fell people are being led by a false prophet if they think salvation is based on skin tone. take this food for thought. take any man of any skin color and strip him of his skin you end up with the same red blood and white bones. All bodies found of dead men that have the flesh completely rotten off all look the same.

             I dont believe Jesus was ever crucified, Scripture says, Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed. Jews at that time where determined to get him on the cross (when they could have easily killed him anywhere, because they knew if they succeeded to do that, then Jesus cannot be the true Messiah, because true Messiah cannot be cursed. The idea of dying for the sins of the world, came to light hundred of years after Jesus disappearance, but it does not make any sense, as the Bible says
             <br/>
             Ezekiel 18:20: The person who sins will die. The son will not bear
             <br/>
             the punishment for the fathers iniquity, nor will the father bear the
             <br/>
             punishment for the sons iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous
             <br/>
             will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon
             <br/>
             himself. Why would someone else die for your sins? This life is a test, and you will be awarded or punished according to your actions and belief Besides, Jesus prayed and asked to God to save him. If he came to die for the sins of the world, why would he ask God to save him? It is revealed in holy Quran:
            </p>
            <p>
             Surat An-Nisa [4:157] And  [for]  their  saying,
             <br/>
             Indeed,  we  have  killed  the  Messiah,  Jesus,  the  son  of  Mary,
             <br/>
             the messenger  of Allah .  And  they  did  not  kill  him,  nor  did
             <br/>
             they  crucify  him;  but  [another] was  made  to  resemble  him  to
             <br/>
             them.  And  indeed,  those  who  differ  over  it  are  in  doubt about
             <br/>
             it.  They  have  no  knowledge  of  it  except  the  following  of
             <br/>
             assumption.  And  they did  not  kill  him,  for  certain.
             <br/>
             Jesus is a prophet of God (a human being), not Godand he was never crucified, Come to truth, stop following your own desires, start questioning and reasoning, and seek for the truth

             The bible says his hair and head was as white as as wool, white as snow. Its  not making referrence to hair texture but hair color. Some people suffer from poor reading comprehension. His feet are like bronze glowing in a furnace. Has anyone ever seen bronze in a furnace? Its radiant, bright orange and white color. Its not brown or black. Look it up. Any metal that put in a furnace is going to look radiant bright orange and white. People want to read into things and twist words to fit their agenda. Pathetic.

             Hello people in this forum
             <br/>
             My Name is Seonitix Wendy, I was married to my husband for 10 years and we were both bless with three children, living together as one love, until 2012 when things was no longer the way the was [when he lost his job]. But when he later gets a new job 6 months after, he stated sleeping outside our matrimonial home. Only for me to find out that he was having an affair with the lady that gave he the job. since that day, when i called him, he dont longer pick up my calls and he nothing since to come out good. Yet my husbands just still keep on seeing the lady. Until I met a very good friend of my who was also having a similar problem, who introduced me to a very good love spell caster. But i told her that if it has to do with things that i am not interested, but she said that it has nothing to do with pay first. but the only thing he was ask to do was just to go and buy the items to cast the spell, and that was what she did. And she gave me the spell caster e-mail address and phone number. When i contacted him,

              solutionoflovespelltemple@gmail.com
             </a>
             , i was so surprise when he said that if i have the faith that i will get my husband back in the nest three [3] day, and off which it was really so. but i was so shock that i did not pay any thing to prophet lord, but my husband was on his knells begging me and the children for forgiveness. This testimony is just the price i have to pay. This man Prophet lord is good and he is the author of my happiness. His e-mail address:

             I see many responding as to his being black, white, or what ever color The Bible is silent because we as humanity want to take some special prominence in our race or place in society by coat tailing or so many think with His physical appearance..now, the bronze is not of this world just as the white wool hair descriptorthat is obviously a spiritual body not of this earth. I hope this helps some that want to some how see some advantage of being the same race as Jesus.if you do you miss His entire message.its about the heart, not the outward appearances..understand.read the book of John and ask God for understanding and wisdomAlso, Jesus said be Like Him, not in some fleeting physical appearance but in the very essence of Jesus Beinghaving been born again

             According to my friend the ancient Jewish archaeologist, Jesus wasnt a carpenter at all, and neither was Joseph. The Jews didnt build much from wood, because there werent any large trees to use. They dont grow in Judea, and shipping lumber was simply not practical (except for something like Solomons temple). Jesus was a stone mason, as was Joseph.

             My name is  Elizabeth Campbell, Am from USA, my partner and I have been trying for a baby for over two years now, We were going to a fertility clinic for about 5 months before somebody told us to contact this spell caster who is so powerful, We contacted him at this email; (driayaryi2012@hotmail.com) , for him to help us, then we told him our problem, he told us that we will either conceive in February 2014 or March 2014,but after two years of trying we were at a point where we were willing to try anything.

             We do know what Jesus looked likehe looked like Horus, since the Jesus myth is based on the Egyptian legend of Horus. The sky god who who was born of a virgin, did great works, and was crucified for his efforts. The three wise men?? The three stars in the belt of Orion, which presaged the spring harvest. There is nothing new under the sun, including in religion.

             Yeshua (Jesus Christ of Nazareth) was a Nazarene as per prophecy.
             <br/>
             Nazarene men all had long hair and it was nothing to be ashamed over. I
             <br/>
             have heard scoffer quotes of Paul about length of hair and that men were
             <br/>
             to have short hair or it was considered shameful, and the women long
             <br/>
             hair(1 Cor. 11.5). Paul was born too late (1Cor.15.8) to have literally
             <br/>
             walked with Messiah as a grown man and styles do change. During the time
             <br/>
             of Christ among non-Jews of the area the style for men was a bowl
             <br/>
             shaped haircut pretty much like what the Beatles wore. There is also
             <br/>
             another Messianic prophecy in Scripture that describes Messiahs eyes as
             <br/>
             being the color of deep wine (Gen 49.10-12), far from the blue as
             <br/>
             supposedly described by Pilate. Shiloh is an ancient term for Messiah.
             <br/>
             This very Scripture was quoted by Rabbis in the Babylonian Talmud as
             <br/>
             they ripped their clothing and lamented in the streets with ashes and
             <br/>
             sackcloth because the scepter (authority over life and death)was taken
             <br/>
             from Judah(the tribes of ruling kings) when the means of instilling
             <br/>
             capitol punishment (proclaiming the death sentence) was removed from the
             <br/>
             Temple priests and placed into the hands of the Romans. The priests
             <br/>
             themselves actually decided to have this done because more and more of
             <br/>
             the corrupt priesthood was becoming hand picked by a non-Jew called
             <br/>
             Herod (an Edumean -Esaus lineage) to run the Temple. Apostasy and
             <br/>
             murder abounded (mob rule) at that time and the true priesthood were
             <br/>
             being killed off all for fighting against what the Herods were doing to
             <br/>
             true Jewish worship. This passing away of the scepter was only supposed
             <br/>
             to be fulfilled after Shiloh(Messiah) would come.The Jews are still
             <br/>
             looking for Messiah!  Little did those rabbis know, a young boy growing
             <br/>
             into manhood was already born in Bethlehem and living in Nazareth who is
             <br/>
             the Paschal(Passover) Lamb of God who would removed forever the sins of
             <br/>
             men [as versus just a covering of sin that had to be repeated over and
             <br/>
             over again through animal sacrifice(Heb 10.1-18)]  I took a look at
             <br/>
             other translations of various authors by the same two men who
             <br/>
             supposedly translated the Pilate writings (Archko Volumes). They all
             <br/>
             have the same syntax and grammar. All these ancient authors sound as
             <br/>
             though there is only one writer writing them all. Literal translations
             <br/>
             usually still have the flair of word usage and grammar of the original
             <br/>
             author. In the Bible one can tell the writings of Paul as versus Jesus
             <br/>
             literal brother James. There was so much conjecture and allegory as well
             <br/>
             as just plain outright made up lies for fortune and glory done in the
             <br/>
             3rd and 4th century and much later that I always am skeptical. If it
             <br/>
             doesnt agree with Scripture then it just isnt true.We also have to
             <br/>
             keep in mind that there were heretics making false writings almost from
             <br/>
             the founding of the church. The apostles recorded this apostasy in the
             <br/>
             Bible and even writings of the early church fathers against the heresies
             <br/>
             which agree with Scripture help us see who the liars are. Some people
             <br/>
             decided just because a writing is old that it must be truth even when
             <br/>
             sinners abounded just as much then as they do today. It saddens me to
             <br/>
             see another cult springing up which worships 100% heretical writings of
             <br/>
             the Dead Sea Scrolls because they were supposedly written before the
             <br/>
             Bible when only some of the scrolls are actual truth and a lot of it
             <br/>
             written by the very heretics the early church warns about. Some of the
             <br/>
             scrolls are bizarre descriptions of hidden information held back from us
             <br/>
             written by cults quoting Scripture as a means of trying to gain
             <br/>
             authenticity for the pack of lies they add to it. Eve was deceived by
             <br/>
             Satan possessing a snake acting as though God lied and was holding
             <br/>
             something back from her and Adam in  an effort  to tempt her to sin. But
             <br/>
             we all know that God held nothing back from Adam and Eve that was good
             <br/>
             from the beginning, and all they got for their efforts was purest evil
             <br/>
             and the curses placed upon all mankind and all our planet with them.
             <br/>
             They already knew they were naked in the Garden and were not ashamed(Gen
             <br/>
             2.25). What they lost was the Shekinah covering of glory they got by
             <br/>
             being in the presence of God each evening as they walked with God. Sin
             <br/>
             separates us from God.If we were in the very presence of God with sin
             <br/>
             upon us wed drop dead just as sure as the guy in Raiders of the Lost
             <br/>
             ark dropped dead when he tried to keep it from falling. God can not
             <br/>
             change who He is or His very nature (Mal.3.6). To be with our very own
             <br/>
             Creator we have to be the ones to change.  Moses was covered in this
             <br/>
             glory as He came down from the mountain and wasnt even aware he was
             <br/>
             covered in it, but everyone else could see it. Jesus said He did nothing
             <br/>
             in a corner. There are no secrets hidden from us, but plenty is hidden
             <br/>
             from the devil, and those who are perishing find the Word of God as
             <br/>
             folly. May the plagues placed upon those who rewrite the words of
             <br/>
             Revelation fall upon those who knowingly spread falsehood concerning the
             <br/>
             Bible.  Soon, and I feel it in my bones more than ever before, we will
             <br/>
             be joining Him in the clouds. Then I will meet my bridegroom face to
             <br/>
             face and forever we will be together.I can wait, but I must admit I am
             <br/>
             very excited for that day. I still hear people claiming, I am not done
             <br/>
             living my life yet, or I still have stuff I want to do. Well if they try
             <br/>
             heaven they will like it guaranteed. There is an eternity to do
             <br/>
             everything and its all good. Even babies will still be born during the
             <br/>
             millennial reign of Christ, and we will have favored animals too.  What
             <br/>
             bride doesnt anxiously await her wedding with joyful excitement?
             <br/>
             Daniels weeks of years are shavuahs (shabuah in the Strongs)  or
             <br/>
             sabbatical years that are groups of 7 years. Daniel tells us that the
             <br/>
             time of tribulation starts at the beginning of just such a 7 year cycle.
             <br/>
             The rapturo (rapture) comes at the end of the previous 7 year
             <br/>
             cycle.This year (a shimittah year) we are at the end of a 7 year cycle. I
             <br/>
             cant tell you it is this one that the rapture will be in, but signs on
             <br/>
             the earth and in the heavens seem to point to it. There were exactly
             <br/>
             the same signs in the heavens as right now in 32 and 33 AD when our LORD
             <br/>
             was crucified (the reason Peter quoted Joel 2,30 in Acts 2.19) which
             <br/>
             includes the solar eclipses on those specific feast days They also
             <br/>
             occurred in 69-70 AD when the 2nd Temple fell as Christ prophesied.

             Okay, here goes. Firstly, thanks for the article, secondly to all who have commented, it is interesting to see how the bible has been interpreted by each individual person. Yes, there were atrocities made by all our forefathers and even some of us from all racesresearch and pray for revelation and you will see and have the truth revealed to you as God will give you what you need in the time you need and every day is a journey.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember, our God is a great God of peace and Love and has given us a way to be in his light on this earth and to live with him forever in heaven, but through Jesus who came to save all and open up an all inclusive heaven and not an exclusive clubso, as Gentiles we should be deeply deeply greatful for this as previously, this blessing and opportunity was only open to the Israelites who obeyed God and kept Gods laws and instructions, but God examines the heart and saw that many became stiff-necked and disobeyed God by following other gods time and time again (Old Testament book of Kings) and so the scripture says: I will make you a light to the Gentiles, and you will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth..
            </p>
            <p>
             (Isaiah 49:6) and elsewhere in Isaiah God says : I will make them a nation which is not my nation (Ill give you the scripture if needed, but check it out for yourself too)
             <br/>
             So, in conclusion, Christ came to be a light to all including the Gentiles and to save all who come to him for all to the ends of the earth. So racism pushes us away from Loving eachother, light skinned, dark skinned, any other skin colour, etc.
             <br/>
             Two greatest commandments is to Love God and second Love eachotherthis is what keeps us separate from this evil world of Greed, hate, envy, lust, coveting, pride (eg. Im better than you because.) Michael and Guest, you guys got to practice Love and forgiveness and hold to the teachingsits the heart that God looks ata heart of Love, kindness, forgiveness, peace, joy. Michael, it sounds like you are searching my brother and you are on a great journeymay God bless you and lead you each day closer and closer to him, but dont hate like the world hatesI say this with Love and respect. Guest, it seems you are on another journey too, persevere in love and kindness towards others, just like Jesus did even in the midst of things happening around him or being said of him. Let our conversations always be seasoned with saltI also say this with Love and respect..

             Jesus was Jewish. Not white, not black, not asian. He looked similar to what middle-eastern Jews and Arabic people look like today. He had short, dark curly hair, but loose curls like mediterranean people have. Olive complexion. Wide, expressive brown eyes, but ordinary looking in facial features. God chose a humble way of manifesting Himself to humanity to show that flesh is unimportant  He was not carpeted in jewels, fine clothes and long hair like Cesare Borgia. Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a humble donkey. God made it known in the Bible that Jesus physical looks were unimportant and that He blended in. He was a vessel for God to inhabit for a time, to walk among us. I rather like the idea that He looked ordinary, like the rest of us.

             Yes I agree, a lot of people will be shocked! Thats why I dont understand racism! So many people are deceived, some that think they are Christian but hold racist views are in for quite a shock when they stand face to face with the Lord.

             Jesus of Nazareth. Numbers 6 tell you about the nazareth vow. It sounds like something that is plausible. Long hair I mean.

             Bible does not declare any physical appearance of  Jesus. Only first chapter of Revelation describe a picture of Jesus as a son of man, which is a very old man, bright eyes, . If Jesus has a long hair, what is the problem? If you look Samson, John Baptist , they both required to has long hair become a Nazarite. Jesus was a anointed by God, why He was not required to keep long hair? Jehovah witnesses literatures also has a same problem. They shows first man ADAM photo and his hair are very good trim, just like a modern man. what kind of tools Adam was using to keep his hair in good shape and trim? Mary of Magdala City, who was a follower of Jesus, was very beautiful and long hair, Is Jesus said anything about her long hair or about his any disciples? The son of Second king of Israel (David), Absalom always keep long hair and sales every year, It mean, there was a tradition of keep long hair in Bible time.

             Context..the emphasis about Jesus hair IN HEAVEN is not wooly, but on the color white.Read the context and forget your racist theology trying to prove that Jesus was black.He was Jewish.The same as Jews today.In the verse in Revelation the word white is used twice.The subject is the color.not the texture.

             Jesus,  who most likely didnt even exist as he was an amalgamation of other myths from earlier  times,  was made out to be a decent guy in the mythology of the bible. You people who claim to be righteous should be ashamed of yourselves for condemning your fellow man especially over something so insignificant.
             <br/>
             The simple truth is that the bible is historically inaccurate.  There is no clear evidence of the vast majority of it  even happening.  Relying on stories passed down by word of mouth by illiterate goat herders for generations before someone finally wrote it down is probably not the best argument for anything factual.
             <br/>
             Jesus looked like whatever the authorS said he looked like because he wasnt real.

             A few years ago a team of scientists and technicians endeavored to extract the face of Jesus from the Shroud of Turin. (They could not say what the shroud is, only what it IS NOT. And it is NOT a painting.)
             <br/>
             The image extrapolated as a 3-D impression, and the resulting 3-D image looked surprisingly like the guy who portrayed Jesus in the recent Killing Jesus film.

             Trololol the long hair argument
            </p>
            <p>
             Long hair was normal for men back then (read the book of song of songs)
             <br/>
             and the long hair is a sin statement is an interpretation, not a translation.
             <br/>
             Real translation is hair like a woman. BIG DIFFERENCE!

             There are references to the the fact that Jesus wore his
             <br/>
             hair in the manner of the Nazerites. He was born in Bethlehem only because of the census being taken at the time but was a Nazarite and wore a very fine outer woven garment over what seemed to be a white undergarment /robe worn by men at the time . His outer garment was not devided by the soldiers at his horrible crucifixion because it was nicely woven without any seams so the soldiers on watch cast lots for it . . . There is a Roman soldiers document who recorded the moment which was quoted in a British paper (that my Father had bought our family long ago). It said that the soldier never  saw Jesus  laugh and He had even, regular features. It was his eyes that were especially noticeable in his face . . . which were reported by the soldier as grey in appearance. He was said to have been seen to weep . . .
             <br/>
             He had a quiet air of authority and inspired great respect when he spoke . . . (miraculous in itself) as there were no microphones in His time and he spoke and was heard by as many as 12,000 people at a time . . . this is recorded in the gospels of the New Testament . . . When he fed the hungery people because they had listened to His teachings, all who attended and there were many thousands of followers were fed on loaves and fishes which just kept coming , (He had drawn away from the few apostles to pray to His Father and then told them to distribute the few loaves and fishes . . . which kept coming and all were satisfied . . . a very kind, hospitable act of compassion for the crowds who loved to listen to his teachings . . . He was always compassionate and had pity on his fellow man , at the same time, he was no wimp  evidently or He would not have had the fear of the Pharasees and others who saw him as a threat to their own authority . . . at the time.

             I find it funny that whenever the subject of how Yashaya Christ looked like, they always say it doesnt matter how he looked like in earth
            </p>
            <p>
             Guess what? When Christ come backs and is ruling in the earth, how is he going to look like? Lol he was a man, and he is coming back as a man. If he is coming back to save HIS, dont you think he shall look exactly as he did when he lived amongst Israelites???? Lol
            </p>

             Esau doesnt know anything when it comes to our ancestors stories. They only tell what they have been fed by their ancestors.

             Pontius Pilate well describes the appearance of Jesus when He stood before him, in his letter to Rome in which he his actions/decisions regarding Jesus trial.  In the Archo Volume is the transcription of Pilates letter to Rome. Pilate describes Jesus with light color hair and beard (golden-red) which would describe most of the Tribe of Judah.lighter skin, lighter hair and eyes (blue) than their fellow tribesmen who were swarthy, dark hair and eyes.  Being of the Tribe of Judah, Jesus would no doubt take on the appearance of His mothers people.

             Hello everyone!The only true way ,to all people who are white,to understanding ANYTHING is through experience..So since you ve never experienced being black how then can you put yourself in a position to try and understand how a black man or woman should feel or think? The reason why it matters about the skin tone something as little as that,is 2Thes. 2chapter versus 3-4.Are we as blacks suppose to stay ignorant which is one of the definitions to the word nigger? It was said long ago if you take a white mans money ,you then just took the white man himselfGreed is the problem..Blacks will forever wait for their 40 acres and a mule which was promisedEquality is a reference blacks cant claim here in AmericaActually whites are the only ones who can claim such a thing still here in America for the most part..a white man or woman you will never understand that..You wont understand why blacks feel like they have to have something to do with historical facts concerning the Bible Because as blacks everything was stripped from them including their very own nameSo its vital to know where WE come from as blacks because this whole time we are to remain ignorant !!! Right?

             Three facts: an archeological dig of Nazareth shows from DNA and bone studies that the Jews of Jesuss time were not black. Next, if you look at the art from Dura Europos show the Jews to not be black. Lastly, the sheep indigenous to the middle east have long straight hair (Awassi and fat tailed sheep).

             Yashua was a white man with blond hair.John the revelator made reference to the color of his hair when he said it was white like wool . His beard was blond and the whiskers stood straight off of his face instead of laying down like most mens beard do now. His beard was thick and full and it covered his cheek bones to his side burns. His nose was like that of Adam  the fellow on the bonanza western series. In statue he stood about 6ft maybe a little over. I dont understand the rest of these comments obviously none of these people know the Lord.
