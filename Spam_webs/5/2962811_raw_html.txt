         Anyone interested in emigrating to Australia and starting a new life down under will be concerned to learn that there is a severe backlog of applications from skilled migrants for residency visas. Those with their applications in the system will be acutely aware that its a time consuming process, but its just been announced that there is over a 2-year backlog of applications waiting to be processed.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Australias economy has weathered the global economic storm well  so far. In part this is because of its natural resources, mining activity and exports to China. According to many sources, Australia now has a skills shortage as a result  however, you wouldnt necessarily know that if you heard that there are over 140,000 applications from skilled individuals sitting on the shelf of the immigration department.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact of the matter is, Australia is not out of the woods yet economically speaking, there is talk that it has yet to face its day of fiscal reckoning. Therefore its no surprise that the government is being cautious about who it lets in, and how many migrants in total it allows to have a residency visa each year. If youre dead set on moving to live and work in Australia though, dont panic because we have some top tips to help you beat the skilled migrant visa backlog.

         Ask anyone thinking of living in Australia to tell you the name of the nations capital city and chances are theyll tell you that its Sydney. Well its not! For those wishing to emigrate to Australia you need to brush up on your facts, the capital city is Canberra! Its a bustling city of 336,000 inhabitants set in the Australian Capital Territory and surrounded by New South Wales. Canberra is 150 kilometres inland from the pacific ocean, and just a 3 hour drive from Sydney, 2  hours from Australias snow fields and a couple of hours from some of Australias best beaches.

        So whats the attraction for expats wanting to emigrate to Australia? Why are they going to choose Canberra as their place to live down under?
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly for expats emigrating to Australia, Canberra boasts one of the lowest levels of unemployment in the nation, with the median figure consistently under 3%. Put that beside the fact that workers in Canberra receive the highest average wages and employers are crying out for skilled and professional labour, and you can see why so many expats relocating to Australia choose Canberra as their final destination.

         The introduction of a rigid and structured points system has made emigrating to Australia far more difficult than back in the days of the ten pound pom when a desperate government would allow any reasonably healthy, criminally unhindered European to enter Oz with a view to starting a new life in Australia.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, anyone between the ages of 18-45 can live and work in Australia providing they can accumulate enough points to get a visa. Points are allocated according to occupation, age and proficiency in English for example.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics census of 2006, 24% of the Australian population were born outside of Australia; the largest group of 1,153,264 having been born in the British Isles, but if you dont get the required points you wont be emigrating to Australia!
