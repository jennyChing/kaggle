      Designing a four-bedroom family home within the Kew Green Conservation Area of southwest London, England was a challenge the architects at

      successfully met. The
      <strong>
       Kew House
      </strong>
      is composed of two weathering steel volumes implemented in the continuity of a retained nineteenth century stable wall. In response to the clients brief, Piercy&amp;Company designed the house as a built diagram of the way the family wanted to use the spaces, with an internal landscape of alternative routes and levels connecting expressive areas aimed at creating moments of delight for adults and children alike.

      <br/>
      An abundance of natural lighting and flexible areas for socializing stood at the basis of the layout: The house is formed of a simple plan to make the most of the constrained site, reduce the buildings mass in the streetscape and respond to the living patterns of the family. Consisting of two rectangles; one slightly smaller, set back and sunken 1m lower, the wings each have living spaces on the ground floor and bedrooms above. Despite an array of planning constraints, the residence answers the modern living needs of a family, while being well anchored in its architecture context. [Photography by

      We spend one third of our lives sleeping and countless hours laying in bed, so why not make it a five-star luxury experience? We want to share bedding ideas with you to make your bed comfortable, modern and beautiful, just like a luxury hotel bed.
      <p>
       When we looked at what experts uncovered on what makes a bed comfortable and inviting, we found some surprising and helpful tips on how to create a beautiful sleeping space filled with good bedding ideas. All the discoveries led to one main concept:
       <b>
        The best bedding ideas address all five of the beds layers.
       </b>
      </p>
      <h2>
       Getting started
      </h2>
      <p>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-17" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221320" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-17.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Your bedding is the perfect place to infuse color, pattern and luxury into your bedroom. When thinking about bedding ideas for your bedroom, address every layer of the bed from mattress to top-of-the-bed adornment.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most important components ofthe bed decorating process is determining your color strategy. Layer classic neutrals (like white) for your sheets, combined with monochromatic texture, bold colors or contemporary patterns for the accent pieces that include:
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
       Decorative throw pillows
       <br/>
       Duvet covers
       <br/>
       Throw blankets
      </p>
      <p>
       For a modern bedroom that highlights your bedding,tie inyour accent color theme with your bedrooms headboard, a wallpaper wall behind the bed or bold, large wall art.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-15" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221318" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-15.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Choosing classic colors for the investment pieces while adding decorative accent items in bold colors and patterns is the secret to a well-designed bed that is versatile all year. With this design approach to your bedding, you can change the look of your bedroom quickly and affordably as the season or mood changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you may want to have a white bed foundation with a selection of tropical blue accents in the summer and warm rich accents including a faux fur throw for the winter like the images below.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-5" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221308" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-5.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       Here are bedding ideas and tips for all five bed layers, so you can sleep in style luxuriously:
      </h2>
      <h3>
       Layer 1: Mattress and mattress toppers
      </h3>
      <p>
       A good mattress is the foundation to a goods night sleep. You can upgrade a mattress further with a good layer below the sheets to give a bed a fluffy, inviting look and feel. Add a feather bed or memory foam mattress pad under your sheets. Either option will give your bed that marshmallow-like layer that invites you to dive into your bed.
      </p>
      <h2>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-13" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221316" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-13.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </h2>
      <h3>
       Layer 2: Sheets
      </h3>
      <p>
       Hotels spend a lot of time and money studying what makes a bed comfortable. The Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott have all discovered one secret to an alluring bed: 300-count cotton sheets. Surprisingly, consumers find that 300 count sheets are just as comfortable as some of the higher thread count sheets available. The good news for you is that 300-count sheets are often cheaper than higher thread counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But theres more to the sheet secret than thread count. Shortly after the Westin Hotel brand introduced the
       <a href="https://www.westinstore.com/westin-heavenly-bed.aspx">
        Heavenly Bed
       </a>
       , Westins internal survey of overall guest loyalty and satisfaction increased dramatically, and these satisfaction scores have continued to increase over the years. Westin customers love the white, fluffy Heavenly Bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The takeaway from the research these hotels have invested in is to invest in quality, 300-count white sheets as your staple.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Layer 3: Pillows
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-7" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221310" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-7.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sleep Pillows
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pillows are important to a bed for comfort and design. But there needs to be a balance between too few and being swallowed up by too many pillows. The
       <a href="http://www.sleepcomfortably.org/many-pillows-sleep/">
        Sleep Comfortably Foundation
       </a>
       suggests two regular-sized sleep pillows for maximum comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Four Seasons Hotel is famous for its luxurious sleep pillows made of down. But if you suffer from allergies to down or feathers, there are down alternatives that are hypoallergenic. Select the pillow you find most comfortable and have two per person.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Decorative Pillows
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Once youve chosen the perfect sleep pillow, its time to accessorize the bed with decorative pillows. This is your opportunity to add a bold or unique touch to your bed. Choose a favorite pattern and color that enhances your bedroom design and add one of the following decorative pillow combinations to your bed:
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
       A large bolster, the length of the bed
       <br/>
       A pair of Euro shams (2525 square pillows)
       <br/>
       A grouping of16 to 20 decorative pillows
       <br/>
       One or two smaller rectangular bolsters, the length of a standard sleep pillow
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221305" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-2.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <h3>
       Layer 4: Bed cover or comforter
      </h3>
      <p>
       A down comforter is a practical and luxurious bed cover choice. Down is fluffy and perfectly insulating during summer or winter, making the investment in down feathers worthwhile. As we mentioned, if you have allergies to down, there are plenty of hypoallergenic down comforter alternatives on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personalize your comforter with a quality duvet cover. And for warmer months where youd rather not have the extra insulating layer, go with a light quilt instead of a down comforter.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Layer 5: Throw Blanket
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="bedding-ideas-20" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221323" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bedding-ideas-20.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A throw blanket has become a popular addition to dressing up your bed. Its a great extra layer when youre feeling cold, while adding a contemporary design element to finish your bed.Fold and place your throw blanket as a runner or stripe for a designer look.
      </p>
      <p>
       When selecting the finishing touches of throw blanket and decorative pillows, choose them with each other in mind. They should be bold, coordinate with each other and serve as the final touches to your beautiful and luxurious hotel-like bed.

      , a surprisingly spacious residence located on the island of Schiermonnikoog in The Netherlands. Larch wood in various sizes was employed for the facade, resulting in a dwelling that integrates well with its environment. The roof was built using wood, zinc and moss sedum, thus further contributing to its context-dictated look. According to the designers, the height and form of both roof and faade have been continuously adjusted to the dune surroundings, enabling the house to develop its own unique character.

      <br/>
      The L-shaped dwelling has a total surface of 110 square meters and perfectly delimits the day and night areas: The underground floor comprises the bedrooms, bathrooms and sauna. A patio  hidden from view at ground-level by a low wooden wall on the west faade  brings in both sunlight and ventilation. The relationship between the two floors combines privacy with a human scale, allowing family members to use the house in their own way without causing disturbance to others. Sustainable features of the project include triple-glazed windows, solar orientation, an optimum underground temperature and natural shading on the south faade provided by an overhang.

      is located on a vast wooded plot of land. Although certainly contemporary, the new residence is built on the same foundations as the original house while preserving one of its principal characteristics; split levels. This principle is at the very heart of this buildings new architecture. This thorough building overhaul, in combination with a larger upstairs, was designed in order to meet the needs of a person living alone. Despite a small 1500 square foot living space, the residence offers vast open rooms with an abundance of natural lighting.
      <br/>
      <img alt="exterior modern home design" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221418" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/exterior-modern-home-design.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      <br/>
      The house now features three split levels that are each designed for a distinct set of functions that help establish a clear hierarchy between intimate and communal zones. These zones are designed to be very open in relation to each other and are only divided by the threshold created by the flights of stairs. Directly accessible from the carport and at the same height as the ground outside is the first of three levels that contains both the entrance vestibule as well as a small office. Even though this entry zone is also open, it is concealed from the living spaces on the level above.
      <p>
       Once in the center of the staircase leading to the second level, the visitor comes face to face with a large window with a view on the woods behind the home. The kitchen can be found there, organized around a large wooden island whose materials stand out in relation to the neutral white walls. Along the large bay window adjoining the kitchen can be found the dining and living rooms. The staircase and corridor leading to the owners private suite on the top level arelocated behind a central block and have a view on the inferior levels.

      Regardless of your closets size, the most important component is organization. Here are some closet organization ideas that create a functional, gorgeous space thats uncluttered and has designated spots for everything.
      <blockquote>
       <h3>
        Out of clutter, find simplicity.  Albert Einstein
       </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Before you get started with adding fixtures and getting your closet organized, pull out all your clothing and accessories and edit them down. Limit the items in your closet to pieces that you love and use. This helps in cutting the visual clutter and overwhelm people sometimes feel when entering their closet. Some important tips to use during the editing process include:
      </p>
      <p>
       Donating anything you havent worn in the last year
       <br/>
       Donating or recycling any clothing or accessories that are torn, broken or permanently stained
       <br/>
       Having a tailor alter items that you like but dont fit properly
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <h3>
        Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.  William Morris
       </h3>

      <p>
       Now that youve selected yourwardrobe items worth displaying, its time to create an efficient and beautiful space with our closet organization ideas.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <b>
        Color Coordination
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="closet color and shelves" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221576" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closet-color-and-shelves.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hang like items like pants, tops, dresses and jackets in the same area, by color. Use the same type of hanger for a finished, cohesive look. This will create an organized collection that makes pieces easy to find while looking great.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <b>
        A Space for All Seasons
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="closet featured" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221615" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closet-featured.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Get into the habit of cleaning and storing seasonal items until you need them. Keep boxes or baskets to store winter items. Space Bags that can be vacuum sealed save tons of space, especially for bulky items like down jackets and winter gear. Trade them out as needed and store the summer items in their place.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <b>
        Invest in Drawers
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="drawers storage" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221629" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/drawers-storage.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Drawers are some of the best closet storage pieces. If adding drawer space to your existing closet, opt for a combination of shallow and deeper drawers. Keep drawers organized by adding dividers or inserts like the drawer above. Shallow drawers are great for everything from jewelry to scarves and sweaters. Its easier to find items in a shallow drawer than stacking them (where they can be forgotten) in a deep drawer.
      </p>
      <h4>
       <b>
        Store folded items like sweaters or t-shirts vertically, instead of horizontally, so you can see all folded items in a drawer.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <h3>
       <b>
        Organize The Little Things
       </b>

      </p>
      <p>
       Use trays and cubbies to hold smaller items. For accessories like belts or ties, smaller cubicle storage organizes smaller items best and most beautifully.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <b>
        Display Your Day
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="closet-dressing-area" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221619" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closet-dressing-area1.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A great way to be inspired to get dressed every morning is by creating a designated spot in your closet to hang and display your outfits. If you have the room, create a dressing area with a storable ironing board and a bench or chair for prep and dressing time. Add a mood board of favorite, inspirational people or magazine photos to help lift your mood and get dressed.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <b>
        Open Shelving
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="open shelves" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221630" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/open-shelves.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Add a contemporary touch to your closet by adding an open shelves. The open shelf is the perfect spot for a display of favorite handbags and other objects including neatly folded sweaters. Some good ways include a built in, free standing bookcase or wall-mounted floating shelves.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <b>
        Light It Up
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       <img alt="closet lighting" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221616" src="http://cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closet-lighting2.jpg" style=" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" width="550"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Add lighting throughout your newly-organized closet. There are a number of clever, low-voltage and battery powered lights that can be added to shelves, drawers and other dark corners. Look for lighting that turns on and shuts off automatically for drawers and cabinets. Good lighting highlights your organized closet, makes it easier to find items and makes your closet look bigger.

       A closet with large drawers and big, deep shelves is not as efficient as youd think. Things get lost in back, shoes become a jumbled mess and items stacked in tall shelf spaces topple over easily or make it difficult to grab the bottom items. Make these big spaces smaller and more efficient by adding dividers into the drawers, designated shoe holders or extra shelving to break up the open shelf space. Make it a rule to stack no more than five items per shelf.

       Keep Your Closet Organized
      </h3>
      <p>
       Once you create a beautiful and uncluttered closet, keep it that way. Put items in their place as you use them. If a section seems to look disorganized often, figure out

        how you can better organize
       </a>
       that section. Perhaps you may need a catch-all basket or a box for some of the items in the unruly area.

       Make a habit of periodically donating yourclothes and accessories you no longer use. David Lewis, famed industrial designer for Bang and Olufsen said it best:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <h3>
        Truly elegant design incorporates top-notch functionality into a simple, uncluttered form.
       </h3>
