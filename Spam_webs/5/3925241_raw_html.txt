&lt;p class="subhead"&gt;&lt;B&gt;The
Reality Test&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even
in comedy, unrealistic plots and stereotyped characters often
indicate a warped moral perspective. Programs that do not depict the
painful consequences of wrong actions distort reality. Just as we
should not spend our lives aimlessly associating with evil people and
fools as it says in I Corinthians 15:33, we also should not invest
valuable time watching immoral and frivolous Television programming.
Every family member should learn to be a critical viewer, ready to
switch off &quot;junk&quot; productions that are done in poor taste.
We all should be willing to explain our viewing choices to other
family members. 
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p class="subhead"&gt;&lt;B&gt;The
Value Test&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxation
is a legitimate need, but some kinds of relaxation are better than
others. It is for good reason that TV has been called the &quot;plug-in
drug.&quot; Even recreational time should not be squandered. Can we
justify the time we spend watching particular television programs (or
movies) as compared to other more active forms of recreation - like
reading, visiting with friends, playing a game, taking a walk, or
working in the yard? Does the time we spend watching TV make us more
productive and balanced people, or is it draining our vitality and
undermining our creativity?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p class="subhead"&gt;&lt;B&gt;The
Morality Test&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We
live in a fallen world. Consequently, all good art acknowledges the
reality of evil. Art that ignores evil has no depth. The greatest
writers and playwrights of the ages have always grappled with evil.
But they portrayed evil without glamorizing or sensationalizing it.
Sometimes actors need to play roles portraying immorality. But a good
program distinguishes between acting and exhibitionism. As the
commercial networks to boost ratings promote more and more &quot;soft&quot;
pornography, we should keep in mind the simple insight that
fornication &quot;acted out&quot; by professional actors and recorded
on film for public entertainment is still fornication. Human sexual
intimacy is too precious to be prostituted by the media under the
guise of &quot;realism&quot; or &quot;artistic freedom.&quot;
Similarly, both the testimony of common sense and academic circles
affirm that media violence, even when simulated, has the effect of
desensitizing viewers, lowering their inhibitions, and creating an
appetite to see more. Today's media, like the Roman circus, often
exploits evil rather than exposing it, gaining viewers by inflaming
their passions. If we regularly test our TV viewing by these three
standards, Reality, Value, and Morality, we will probably find that
it will be greatly reduced or even eliminated altogether. Your
family's use of the media says a lot to your family and friends about
its values, priorities, goals, and dreams.&lt;/P&gt;
