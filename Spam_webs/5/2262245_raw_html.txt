Another difference from previous meetings is that the conference itself will not be where a deal is thrashed out that invariably fails to meet expectations.\r\n\r\nInstead, national governments are set to follow the European Union&rsquo;s lead and set out their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) over the next 3-4 months. &ldquo;We will have a sense of what the likely range of emissions reductions will look like,&rdquo; Kenber added. The EU has said that it will cut emissions by at least 40% by 2030, while Switzerland has pledged to halve its emissions by the same date.\r\n\r\nAnother cause for optimism is that while the UN negotiations remain tortuous, with a sense that they are a zero-sum game, &ldquo;outside the UN process, we have seen remarkable progress in the falling cost of renewables, which is being followed by a fall in the cost of storage,&rdquo; Kenber said. &ldquo;There have been huge changes in places like China and India &ndash; the world has changed much more quickly than the negotiating process.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFor the first time in years, China&rsquo;s intentions are reasonably clear following the meeting last year between Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping in November. At this meeting, China announced that it would cap its emissions by 2030 and increase the proportion of non-fossil fuel energy to 20% by the same date. Shortly after, it said it would cap the use of coal by 2020.\r\n\r\nThe world&rsquo;s second biggest economy is also stepping up its investment outside China, with the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the $40 billion Silk Road infrastructure fund to boost connectivity across Asia, said Changhua Wu, executive director for Greater China at the Climate Group.\r\n\r\nIn India, which has long been resistant to taking on its own climate change commitments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently tore up the country&rsquo;s target to install 20GW of solar capacity by 2022 and replaced it with a plan to build 100GW of projects by the same date &ndash; a move that could create up to 1 million jobs. This is one of a number of initiatives that suggest India&rsquo;s attitude to climate change negotiations may become less confrontational.\r\n\r\nThe political landscape for climate change in the US appears as gridlocked as ever, but Doug Lawrence, founder of green real estate fund at 5 Stone Green Capital and Climate Group board member, said that sentiment is changing. &ldquo;For Generations X, Y and Z, climate change is an issue that they care about and it will be a significant issue in the next presidential election.&rdquo;\r\n&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;\nHowever, he added that American voters&nbsp;still lack awareness about climate change. \"Americans are not very aware of what climate change is and what it can do to us. Nor do they realise how seriously the rest of the world is taking the challenge of climate change.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, cities, regional governments and businesses around the world are pressing ahead with their own initiatives that don&rsquo;t rely on action &ndash; or the lack of it &ndash; at national level. Many businesses already use a carbon price in their business strategies and investment decisions, pointed out Ben Ferrari, director of partnerships, who is spearheading the group&rsquo;s RE100 initiative to support major corporations to commit to source 100% of their energy from renewable sources. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s palpable nonsense to claim that businesses won&rsquo;t support a carbon price,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because they are already using them.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut despite the encouraging developments the Climate Group outlined, Kenber ended with a note of caution about the prospects for a Paris agreement. &ldquo;It is not a question of whether there will be an agreement but whether it will be enough to limit temperature rises to 2&deg;C. Current commitments suggest that it will not.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nDespite encouraging developments in recent months, there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;","text":null,"description":"The countdown has started to the Paris climate conference at the end of the year and this time, there will be a binding deal between the parties to cut emissions, according to Mark Kenber, chief executive at The Climate Group.

countdown has started to the Paris climate conference at the end of the year and this time, there will be a binding deal between the parties to cut emissions, according to Mark Kenber, chief executive at The Climate Group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous meetings, Paris is not the end of the process, its more of a signal on where the world is on climate change, he said at a media briefing in London. Another difference from previous meetings is that the conference itself will not be where a deal is thrashed out that invariably fails to meet expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, national governments are set to follow the European Unions lead and set out their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) over the next 3-4 months. We will have a sense of what the likely range of emissions reductions will look like, Kenber added. The EU has said that it will cut emissions by at least 40% by 2030, while Switzerland has pledged to halve its emissions by the same date.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another cause for optimism is that while the UN negotiations remain tortuous, with a sense that they are a zero-sum game, outside the UN process, we have seen remarkable progress in the falling cost of renewables, which is being followed by a fall in the cost of storage, Kenber said. There have been huge changes in places like China and India  the world has changed much more quickly than the negotiating process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time in years, Chinas intentions are reasonably clear following the meeting last year between Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping in November. At this meeting, China announced that it would cap its emissions by 2030 and increase the proportion of non-fossil fuel energy to 20% by the same date. Shortly after, it said it would cap the use of coal by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The worlds second biggest economy is also stepping up its investment outside China, with the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the $40 billion Silk Road infrastructure fund to boost connectivity across Asia, said Changhua Wu, executive director for Greater China at the Climate Group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In India, which has long been resistant to taking on its own climate change commitments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently tore up the countrys target to install 20GW of solar capacity by 2022 and replaced it with a plan to build 100GW of projects by the same date  a move that could create up to 1 million jobs. This is one of a number of initiatives that suggest Indias attitude to climate change negotiations may become less confrontational.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The political landscape for climate change in the US appears as gridlocked as ever, but Doug Lawrence, founder of green real estate fund at 5 Stone Green Capital and Climate Group board member, said that sentiment is changing. For Generations X, Y and Z, climate change is an issue that they care about and it will be a significant issue in the next presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;However, he added that American voters&nbsp;still lack awareness about climate change. Americans are not very aware of what climate change is and what it can do to us. Nor do they realise how seriously the rest of the world is taking the challenge of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, cities, regional governments and businesses around the world are pressing ahead with their own initiatives that dont rely on action  or the lack of it  at national level. Many businesses already use a carbon price in their business strategies and investment decisions, pointed out Ben Ferrari, director of partnerships, who is spearheading the groups RE100 initiative to support major corporations to commit to source 100% of their energy from renewable sources. Its palpable nonsense to claim that businesses wont support a carbon price, he said, because they are already using them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But despite the encouraging developments the Climate Group outlined, Kenber ended with a note of caution about the prospects for a Paris agreement. It is not a question of whether there will be an agreement but whether it will be enough to limit temperature rises to 2&deg;C. Current commitments suggest that it will not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite encouraging developments in recent months, there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;"],"brandsToFilter":null,"galleryId":null,"removePaywall":null,"disableDigest":null,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelId":null,"channelName":"Business","sectionId":null,"sectionName":null,"url":"/business","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_13","channelId":null,"channelName":"Asia","sectionId":null,"sectionName":null,"url":"/asia","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_1section_103","channelId":null,"channelName":"Business","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Strategies","url":"/strategies","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_1section_127","channelId":null,"channelName":"Business","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Reinventing
