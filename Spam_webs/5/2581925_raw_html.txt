    Chaotic Shiny is a generator site aimed at people who write, game, or live in fantasy worlds of their own creation. 
 Grappling with writer's block? Need a character on the fly? Party just walked into a tavern and you want it
to be a little more exciting than normal? Want to flesh out a setting with some detailed religions? 
Chaotic Shiny  is the site for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Generators are divided into rough categories based on what they come up with. Some of them, such as the drink and
name generators, are simple, whereas others, such as the civilization and pantheon gens, are much more detailed. If 
you want a generator that you can't find here, you can make your own with the custom gen builder, or feel free to
    <a href="mailto:chaoticshiny@gmail.com">
     drop me a line
    </a>
    with suggestions or feedback.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Enjoy!

    <a href="http://chaoticshinyproductions.com/NaNoCalendar.zip">
     NaNoWriMo Calendar
    </a>
    is out, helping you stay on track with your word count with options like "no writing on weeekends." It's now more flexible than ever, keeping you on track not just for this November but
for any month in the future! Also, there's a sale over at
    <a href="http://chaoticshinyproductions.com/store.php">
     Chaotic Shiny Productions
    </a>
    in honor of NaNoWriMo: until the end of November, use the code NaNo2014 to get 50% off any orders of two or more products. It's like buy-one-get-one-free but with an extra 50% off for everything else! If there's
any generator packs you've been thinking about trying out, now's the time.

    Whew! It's been a while, hasn't it? I haven't died, and I have made an
    <a href="/armorgen.php">
     Armor Generator
    </a>
    to round out your weapon-laden treasure hoards. As for where I went, the newsletter subscribers got the 
long answer. The short answer is that I have a full time job and a lot going on and while I have no plans to let the site die, I doubt I will be able to update it quite as often as I used to. So don't despair; I plan on more generators. Just
probably not every two weeks the way I used to be able to. Oh, and I also make

    now, which is taking up a bit of time.

    Whew, that was a long break! I'm typing this now from sunny California, so you know my cross-country move was a success. I come back from my hiatus with an awesome new generator,
the
    <a href="tarotgen.php">
     Tarot Card Generator
    </a>
    . I've wanted to do a tarot gen for a long time, but never could quite get it right. I wanted one that blew all the other tarot gens out there out of
the water. I think I succeeded - let me know if you agree.

    A new silly generator, the
    <a href="acfieldgen.php">
     Academic Field Generator
    </a>
    comes up with disciplines like "Thaumaturgical Hydrocryptology," "Atypical Philosophy,"
and "Observational Archetypes."
    <br/>
    By the way, there may be a brief interruption in service (ie email answering and new generators) as I graduate college, move across the country and start a new job.

     Place Name Generator

    comes up with things like "Scaletorn Grasslands" and "Gravefire Heights" as well as nonsense names. I wonder
what's going on in Meatshield Mire?

     Futuristic Spare Part Generator
