   This document is a study of the comprehensive designer Buckminster Fuller, an outstanding character of the 20th century, and a kind of practical visionary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuller's remarkable career as an inventor, architect, designer, cartographer, writer and theorist amounts to a design syllabus in itself, even if his own conclusions and solutions are not accepted and applied. Many people would argue that life might be vastly improved if his designs were better known and implemented.
  </p>
  <p>
   This presentation of his ideas is not intended as a slavish devotional exercise, nor a piece of cynical criticism. Part of the plan here is to investigate the logic of synergetics. At this stage the account is verbal, not visual, but what is important in geometry is the logic rather than the pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
   As originally conceived,
   <b>
    THE FULLER MAP
   </b>
   was intended to help designers and design students in the following ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    It presents a detailed case-study of a comprehensive designer, Buckminster Fuller.
   </li>
   <li>
    It shows how certain theoretical matters may be related to practical design, for instance geometrical ideas are applied to architecture and cartography.
   </li>
   <li>
    It provides check-lists of factors relevant to design.
   </li>
   <li>
    It discusses problem-solving.
   </li>
   <li>
    It may enable the abductive formation of new conceptions of design issues.
   </li>
  </ul>

   The text is a work-in-progress, begun in August 1991, and originally written to meet the structural requirements of John Wood's IDEAbase system. It was compiled and edited as an experimental, dynamic, interactive, screen-based document. It was not, therefore, intended as a completed linear text to be printed onto paper or other static medium.
  </p>
  <p>
   That project is described in
   <b>
    Mapping The Mapper
   </b>
   , a paper co-written by John Wood and Paul Taylor, originally published as part of the 'Electronic Journal of Virtual Culture', Syracuse University, New York, September 1993. This was subsequently re-published as a chapter in "Computers, Communications and Mental Models", eds. Donald Day &amp; Diane Kovacs, London, 1997.
