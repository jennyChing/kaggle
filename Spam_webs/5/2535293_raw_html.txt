     If someone asked me to reveal the #1 smoking-gun evidence that 9/11 was a hoax, I'd show them this short video about Flight 175:
    </p>
    <center>
     <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eL-rU3CCPkc?rel=0" width="640">
     </iframe>
    </center>
    <br/>
    <p>
     Anyone in 9th grade geometry class will tell us the Flight 175 video (seen above) is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     When we use simple math, the plane's wing is not in the right spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Here is why:
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     The building for which the video was supposedly clipped was the Downtown Athletic Club.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is 518 feet tall.
    </p>
    <p>
     The upper southeast corner of the building (right side in video) is roughly 1,920 feet from what was the southwest corner of the south WTC tower.
    </p>
    <p>
     The impact of flight 175 was roughly centered at about 1,000 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      These points define a right triangle:
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Adjacent leg: 1,980 feet
     <br/>
     Opposite leg: 480 feet
     <br/>
     The Hypotenuse is 2,037 feet (according to Pythagoras).
    </p>
    <p>
     Since the plane was decscending when it hit the South Tower, it would have been around 980 feet in altitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Therefore:
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Flight 175 would have been roughly twice as high as the Downtown Athletic Club building when it flew over.
    </p>
    <p>
     That means there is no way the wing should have appeared in front of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Simple mathematics and geography of New York City reveals that this video is a CGI fake.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
     <i>
      But wait - there is more:
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     The two buildings in the video look like they are next to (or even behind) the Twin Towers:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <center>
     <img buildings="" cgi="" src="http://i6.minus.com/j7AmVQXOeGwZr.png" width="600"/>
    </center>
    <p>
     But in reality, these buildings (at both 17 Battery Place and 28 Washington Street) are indeed in front of the viewing area as we see in this view from Battery Park:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <center>
     <img battery="" park="" src="http://i3.minus.com/jVth9Quv1gRdu_e.jpg" width="600"/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
     Also, the perspective of the view makes those two buildings appear to be taller than the Twin Towers (even though they're less than half the height).
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, coming out of the Battery Tunnel (next to Battery Park where this video is alleged to have been taken) looks nothing like what is shown in this video... you'd have to be in the middle of a bunch of trees in the park. It's an impossible shot from on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Now take a look at this snapshot from the video:
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <center>
     <img buildings="" missing="" src="http://i4.minus.com/j4Hwiq6IMcJ4I.png" width="685"/>
    </center>
    <p>
     As you can see above the tree line, many buildings are missing - including the 19 Rector Street building!!!
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the biggest smoking-gun evidence that this video is 100% CGI created is the lack of any blur... if this plane is going over 500 miles per hour, there's NO way an amateur photographer is going to capture this airplane without any blur.
