The desired softness and thickness can be completely controlled through adjusting the push button. On both sides of ThinkPillow are two adjusting knobs. Press the right one to make pillow harder and higher. Press the left one to make it softer and lower. Simple adjustments can realize the precise softness and height of the Smart Core.

This is no ordinary cushion. It is made of special material and is filled with small moving spherical particles. Elegant and beautiful, the cushion is designed according to human physiological structure. In addition, while using\u00a0ThinkPillow, Smart Cushion can form a natural curve supporting the neck and head, resulting in the neutralization of neck pressure. With no pressure on the body, you feel like you're sleeping on a cloud. No other pillow can can gift you the quality of sleep offered with ThinkPillow.\nUsed correctly, it will also mitigate the symptoms of cervical spondylosis and snoring. It will bring you the best sleep experience you never had before.\n&lt;b&gt;ThinkSleep\u003C/b&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041930/files/20141124011043-thinksleep700.jpg?1416820243\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;\n\u003C/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041929/files/20141124011022-IMG_1898.JPG?1416820222\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;\n\u003C/b&gt;\nThe most important innovation in ThinkSleep is not to simply track sleep, but to change and improve it to make you sleep better.\nThinkSleep and ThinkPillow are combined together to create a perfect sleep system. Through sleep data analysis, ThinkSleep offers the sleeper suggestions to improve their rest. If the decline of sleep quality is caused by the improper condition of the pillow, ThinkSleep will suggest you to adjust the height and firmness of the ThinkPillow, so as to meet your personal requirements and to reach the best sleep experience.\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041931/files/20141124011115-IMG_1966.JPG?1416820275\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\nThinkSleep is a professional sleep creation product. Compared with some existing wearable smart sleep products, it has additional advantages such as; non-wearable, added Before-sleep Event Marker, comprehensive statistics, remote sleep tracking of family members, smarter alarm clock, perfect combination with ThinkPillow and easy-to-use UI design.\nWearable devices when sleeping will make people feel uncomfortable which may seriously affect the quality of sleep. In these cases sleep tracking can often become meaningless. Sleep enhancement technology should be something that exists and changes our life without disturbing us. Based on this concept, ThinkSleep comes into being.\nThinkSleep has two important functions, firstly, sleep management; secondly, smart alarm .\n&lt;b&gt;Sleep Management:\u003C/b&gt;\n1. Recording sleep status\nThinkSleep can specifically track your sleep behavior and display all the detailed daily sleep data in your smart phone APP, including history records, monthly and annual data.\n2. Before-Sleep Event Marker\nThinkSleep creatively includes the before sleep event marking function, through which you can mark the exciting things you do 3 hours before sleep, such as drink alcohol, coffee, take medicine or do exercise. By analyzing the historical data, the ThinkSleep APP will tell you which behaviors can help you sleep and which may affect your sleep quality. According to this, you can change the bad habits so as to improve your sleep.\n3. A Sleep Keeper of Your Family or Close Friends\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041932/files/20141124011206-_8jepg.jpg?1416820326\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\nIt allows you to care more about your family in an often overlooked, yet critical aspect of our lives. The sleep data of your relatives will be uploaded to the Cloud of lovethink.com, or be directly sent to your APP through Bluetooth. With no need to be shared in social networks, you can check the sleep data of your relatives on your phone any time and any where. This is wonderfully helpful to assist your care of elderly friends and family. If you notice that a loved ones sleep behavior is abnormal over a certain period, you will be able to identify and assist prevention of possible illnesses and maladies. The ThinkSleep APP can also automatically safeguard sleeping patterns and will alert you of poor sleep trends, so if need be, you can make a trip to the doctor as soon as possible.\n&lt;b&gt;Smart Alarm:\u003C/b&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041933/files/20141124011236-_9.jpg?1416820356\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;Smart alarm clock will trigger the alarm at the perfect point in your sleep cycle during the 30 minutes before the set alarm time. If the ThinkSleep detects that you are stirring shortly before your alarm goes off, it will wake you then, rather than waiting, as you could well slip back into a deep sleep.\n\n\u003C/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041935/files/20141124011327-IMG_1902.JPG?1416820407\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\nFor example, the set alarm time is 6:30, then from 6:00 to 6:30, the smart alarm clock will make a judgment according to your sleep status. If you are rousing from sleep during that period, the alarm clock can wake you up then instead of waiting for the set time, preventing from falling deeper into sleep again only to force you awake later feeling terrible (all of a sudden calling it an \"alarm\" just doesn't seem right!).\n\nIn another instance, if you are in the deep sleep status during the pre-alarm period, the smart alarm clock will make a short vibration 15 minutes before the set alarm time to enable you to slowly transfer from deep sleep to light sleep, before triggering the alarm at the set time. In this case, you will be woken from a light sleep status which is a much more merciful morning call experience!\n\nIf you do not want to get up even though the alarm is triggered, turn off the alarm clock just with a double-tap on the ThinkSleep. The awkwardness of looking everywhere for the alarm clock with closed eyes will no longer happen to you because the ThinkSleep is beside you now and it won't disturb others sleep.\n\n&lt;iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F112675974&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F112675974&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F497727827_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\"&gt;\u003C/iframe&gt;\n\n\n&lt;b&gt;Design of ThinkSleep\u003C/b&gt;\n\nThinkSleep has an elegant appearance with black and white as its main color, it is very simple, small, even beautiful. It contains a 3-axis sensor, a small speaker, vibrating motor and a rechargeable battery with standby time for up to 3 months inside. Data transmitting with Smartphone through Bluetooth leads to its strong power in cloud data processing\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041937/files/20141124011451-_12.jpg?1416820491\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041938/files/20141124011503-_11.jpg?1416820503\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\nThe customizable pillow case is designed with great care. Simple graceful design blends with gray and blue colors harmoniously.\u00a0\n\nIt simply attaches to your ThinkPillow or normal pillow and invisibly tracks your sleep at night. You don't need to put on any uncomfortable \"wearables\" or press a button. ThinkSleep knows when you're falling asleep, soundly asleep, thrashing about, or waking up. Everything.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Let's Do a Comparison\u003C/b&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041939/files/20141124011553-_13.jpg?1416820553\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\nAccording\u00a0to\u00a0our analyses,\u00a0an\u00a0unfitting\u00a0and\u00a0uncomfortable\u00a0pillow can pose\u00a0a\u00a0serious\u00a0negative effect on\u00a0your\u00a0sleep\u00a0quality\u00a0and\u00a0health.\u00a0People \u00a0vary\u00a0in\u00a0height,\u00a0weight,\u00a0gender and\u00a0age, as\u00a0a\u00a0result they\u00a0have\u00a0different \u00a0requirements\u00a0for\u00a0their\u00a0pillows.\u00a0Some\u00a0like\u00a0hard\u00a0ones,\u00a0while\u00a0others\u00a0are \u00a0fond\u00a0of\u00a0soft\u00a0ones.\u00a0Some\u00a0prefer\u00a0higher\u00a0ones,\u00a0some\u00a0like\u00a0lower\u00a0ones. \u00a0Almost\u00a0all\u00a0ordinary\u00a0pillows\u00a0are\u00a0designed\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0softness\u00a0and \u00a0height,\u00a0thus\u00a0failing\u00a0to\u00a0cater\u00a0for\u00a0different\u00a0people.\u00a0\n\n\u003C/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041940/files/20141124011621-_14.jpg?1416820581\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\nThe index profile for ThinkPillow is a para-curve. The coordinates for softness and height can be freely adjusted. In response to individual differences, the index moves along the curve. The index profile for ordinary pillows is a straight line. As an analogy. It is a painful ordeal to wear the shoes of the same size regardless of the individual differences.\n\n\u003C/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041941/files/20141124011647-_15.jpg?1416820607\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Who We Are?\u003C/b&gt;\n\nJesun Wang, the designer of ThinkPillow, founder and CEO of Lovethink Studio, is a young industrial designer and inventor who owns more than ten patents from Shanghai China. With his colleagues, including innovation technology entrepreneur Karl McCarrison, we have founded the Lovethink Studio five years ago and have our own skilled and experienced team of outstanding designers in the industry of technological innovation.\n\nWe just really enjoy investigating and developing new and different topics when they come across our path, we are designing for dreams that we want to change the world, even if it's just one nights sleep at a time. We have our own three golden rules for design:&lt;b&gt;Innovation, Practicality, Elegance\u003C/b&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041942/files/20141124011714-_16.jpg?1416820634\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041943/files/20141124011741-_17.jpg?1416820661\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041944/files/20141124011747-IMG_1938.JPG?1416820667\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;The ThinkPillow Story\u003C/b&gt;\n\nWhy did I want to invent the ThinkPillow? To begin with my father, he often slept badly at night because of his cervical spondylosis. From research, I found that my father had been using a bad pillow for sleeping, which led to the injury of his spine. So I decided to make a special pillow that would be conducive to my fathers sleep.\n\nAfter two years of hard work, I finally managed to invent a pillow that is the ThinkPillow, as we called it. I gave the ThinkPillow to my father as a gift on his birthday, from there on in, dad's sleep problem was solved.\n\nThen I realized that there are a lot of people with sleep woes like my father in the world, so I continued to develop the ThinkPillow to create a product that could help anyone achieve a good nights rest.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Next Steps\u003C/b&gt;\n\nThe molds of the system's parts have been built and we have completed product and software application development and testing. We are now ready for mass production, but the factory needs a minimum order quantity to produce, so we come to Indiegogo to ask for help. We hope you believe in the benefit of the ThinkPillow enough to support us, so we can help to change the way we sleep forever.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Only The Best Quality\u003C/b&gt;\n\nThe ThinkPillow team has been working in the industrial manufacturing with global corporations for more than 10 years and we have deep experience in bringing innovative, successful products to market.\n\nWe have already invested one year of research to ensure the very best materials and the most innovative, compatible design.\n\nThe vast majority of our raw materials for the\u00a0 ThinkPillow have been imported from USA, Germany and Japan. Such as the filling micro-balls , button balls as well as the airbag filling. Also we have 100% ensured they have met the highest level of international environmental standards, an absolute must for a product that serves such an intimate role.\n\nOur staff will be stationed in the production outlets to monitor the assembly process, to ensure we deliver the highest quality products. We will then test, one by one, with a 3rd party quality control and compliance house to ensure each product passes the most stringent standards before it leaves the factory.\n\n\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Risks and challenges\u003C/h2&gt;\n\n\nThinkPillow is a little more complicated than an average adjustable pillow. As it is composed of several parts, these components are produced in separate factories and therefore the foremost consideration is production management and quality assurance between the locations.\u00a0\n\nParticular attention is required to ensure quality control for the production of the ThinkPillows key components. Our staff will be stationed on site at these locations to ensure consistent standards of manufacturing and our 48 hour test cycle policy.\n\nNaturally there will always be risks in any venture; however by implementing stringent production safeguards and conducting a deep level of research, we've dramatically reduced these risks by developing a reliably manufactured product that will actually revolutionize your sleep (and more importantly waking) experience! On top of this, we are 100% committed to our product and are ready to address any possible issues that may come our way.\n\n\n\n\u003C/div&gt;","tagline":"Adjustable pillow and smart sleep keeper.

It will bring you the best sleep experience you never had before.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ThinkSleep\u003C/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041930/files/20141124011043-thinksleep700.jpg?1416820243\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u003C/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041929/files/20141124011022-IMG_1898.JPG?1416820222\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u003C/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important innovation in ThinkSleep is not to simply track sleep, but to change and improve it to make you sleep better.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThinkSleep and ThinkPillow are combined together to create a perfect sleep system. Through sleep data analysis, ThinkSleep offers the sleeper suggestions to improve their rest. If the decline of sleep quality is caused by the improper condition of the pillow, ThinkSleep will suggest you to adjust the height and firmness of the ThinkPillow, so as to meet your personal requirements and to reach the best sleep experience.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041931/files/20141124011115-IMG_1966.JPG?1416820275\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThinkSleep is a professional sleep creation product. Compared with some existing wearable smart sleep products, it has additional advantages such as; non-wearable, added Before-sleep Event Marker, comprehensive statistics, remote sleep tracking of family members, smarter alarm clock, perfect combination with ThinkPillow and easy-to-use UI design.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable devices when sleeping will make people feel uncomfortable which may seriously affect the quality of sleep. In these cases sleep tracking can often become meaningless. Sleep enhancement technology should be something that exists and changes our life without disturbing us. Based on this concept, ThinkSleep comes into being.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThinkSleep has two important functions, firstly, sleep management; secondly, smart alarm .\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep Management:\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Recording sleep status\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThinkSleep can specifically track your sleep behavior and display all the detailed daily sleep data in your smart phone APP, including history records, monthly and annual data.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Before-Sleep Event Marker\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThinkSleep creatively includes the before sleep event marking function, through which you can mark the exciting things you do 3 hours before sleep, such as drink alcohol, coffee, take medicine or do exercise. By analyzing the historical data, the ThinkSleep APP will tell you which behaviors can help you sleep and which may affect your sleep quality. According to this, you can change the bad habits so as to improve your sleep.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. A Sleep Keeper of Your Family or Close Friends\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041932/files/20141124011206-_8jepg.jpg?1416820326\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows you to care more about your family in an often overlooked, yet critical aspect of our lives. The sleep data of your relatives will be uploaded to the Cloud of lovethink.com, or be directly sent to your APP through Bluetooth. With no need to be shared in social networks, you can check the sleep data of your relatives on your phone any time and any where. This is wonderfully helpful to assist your care of elderly friends and family. If you notice that a loved ones sleep behavior is abnormal over a certain period, you will be able to identify and assist prevention of possible illnesses and maladies. The ThinkSleep APP can also automatically safeguard sleeping patterns and will alert you of poor sleep trends, so if need be, you can make a trip to the doctor as soon as possible.\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smart Alarm:\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041933/files/20141124011236-_9.jpg?1416820356\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;Smart alarm clock will trigger the alarm at the perfect point in your sleep cycle during the 30 minutes before the set alarm time. If the ThinkSleep detects that you are stirring shortly before your alarm goes off, it will wake you then, rather than waiting, as you could well slip back into a deep sleep.&lt;br&gt;\n\u003C/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041935/files/20141124011327-IMG_1902.JPG?1416820407\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the set alarm time is 6:30, then from 6:00 to 6:30, the smart alarm clock will make a judgment according to your sleep status. If you are rousing from sleep during that period, the alarm clock can wake you up then instead of waiting for the set time, preventing from falling deeper into sleep again only to force you awake later feeling terrible (all of a sudden calling it an \"alarm\" just doesn't seem right!).\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In another instance, if you are in the deep sleep status during the pre-alarm period, the smart alarm clock will make a short vibration 15 minutes before the set alarm time to enable you to slowly transfer from deep sleep to light sleep, before triggering the alarm at the set time. In this case, you will be woken from a light sleep status which is a much more merciful morning call experience!\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to get up even though the alarm is triggered, turn off the alarm clock just with a double-tap on the ThinkSleep. The awkwardness of looking everywhere for the alarm clock with closed eyes will no longer happen to you because the ThinkSleep is beside you now and it won't disturb others sleep.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F112675974&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F112675974&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F497727827_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\"&gt;\u003C/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design of ThinkSleep\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ThinkSleep has an elegant appearance with black and white as its main color, it is very simple, small, even beautiful.

With his colleagues, including innovation technology entrepreneur Karl McCarrison, we have founded the Lovethink Studio five years ago and have our own skilled and experienced team of outstanding designers in the industry of technological innovation.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We just really enjoy investigating and developing new and different topics when they come across our path, we are designing for dreams that we want to change the world, even if it's just one nights sleep at a time. We have our own three golden rules for design:&lt;b&gt;Innovation, Practicality, Elegance\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041942/files/20141124011714-_16.jpg?1416820634\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041943/files/20141124011741-_17.jpg?1416820661\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041944/files/20141124011747-IMG_1938.JPG?1416820667\" style=\"max-width:620px;\"&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ThinkPillow Story\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why did I want to invent the ThinkPillow? To begin with my father, he often slept badly at night because of his cervical spondylosis. From research, I found that my father had been using a bad pillow for sleeping, which led to the injury of his spine. So I decided to make a special pillow that would be conducive to my fathers sleep.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After two years of hard work, I finally managed to invent a pillow that is the ThinkPillow, as we called it. I gave the ThinkPillow to my father as a gift on his birthday, from there on in, dad's sleep problem was solved.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that there are a lot of people with sleep woes like my father in the world, so I continued to develop the ThinkPillow to create a product that could help anyone achieve a good nights rest.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next Steps\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The molds of the system's parts have been built and we have completed product and software application development and testing. We are now ready for mass production, but the factory needs a minimum order quantity to produce, so we come to Indiegogo to ask for help. We hope you believe in the benefit of the ThinkPillow enough to support us, so we can help to change the way we sleep forever.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only The Best Quality\u003C/b&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ThinkPillow team has been working in the industrial manufacturing with global corporations for more than 10 years and we have deep experience in bringing innovative, successful products to market.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have already invested one year of research to ensure the very best materials and the most innovative, compatible design.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of our raw materials for the\u00a0 ThinkPillow have been imported from USA, Germany and Japan. Such as the filling micro-balls , button balls as well as the airbag filling. Also we have 100% ensured they have met the highest level of international environmental standards, an absolute must for a product that serves such an intimate role.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our staff will be stationed in the production outlets to monitor the assembly process, to ensure we deliver the highest quality products. We will then test, one by one, with a 3rd party quality control and compliance house to ensure each product passes the most stringent standards before it leaves the factory.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Risks and challenges\u003C/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ThinkPillow is a little more complicated than an average adjustable pillow. As it is composed of several parts, these components are produced in separate factories and therefore the foremost consideration is production management and quality assurance between the locations.\u00a0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Particular attention is required to ensure quality control for the production of the ThinkPillows key components. Our staff will be stationed on site at these locations to ensure consistent standards of manufacturing and our 48 hour test cycle policy.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally there will always be risks in any venture; however by implementing stringent production safeguards and conducting a deep level of research, we've dramatically reduced these risks by developing a reliably manufactured product that will actually revolutionize your sleep (and more importantly waking) experience! On top of this, we are 100% committed to our product and are ready to address any possible issues that may come our way.\u003C/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\u003C/div&gt;","owner_type":"individual","main_video_info":{"type":"vimeo","id":"112780605"},"forever_funding_collected_funds":0,"forever_funding_ends_at":null,"fees_split_test_active":false,"team_members":[{"id":1514400,"name":"Lovethink

        ThinkPillow reinvents the bed pillow ,changing the way of we sleep forever.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ThinkPillow is mainly composed of SmartCore and SmartCusion .

       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
        One of the biggest breakthroughs in the ThinkPillow is its inner part, which we call Smart Core and it is very smart. The desired softness and thickness can be completely controlled through adjusting the push button. On both sides of ThinkPillow are two adjusting knobs. Press the right one to make pillow harder and higher. Press the left one to make it softer and lower. Simple adjustments can realize the precise softness and height of the Smart Core. Like magic, this makes ThinkPillow a custom-made pillow for you.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Another innovation in ThinkPillow is its inbuilt Smart Cushion. This is no ordinary cushion. It is made of special material and is filled with small moving spherical particles. Elegant and beautiful, the cushion is designed according to human physiological structure. In addition, while usingThinkPillow, Smart Cushion can form a natural curve supporting the neck and head, resulting in the neutralization of neck pressure. With no pressure on the body, you feel like you're sleeping on a cloud. No other pillow can can gift you the quality of sleep offered with ThinkPillow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Used correctly, it will also mitigate the symptoms of cervical spondylosis and snoring. It will bring you the best sleep experience you never had before.

       </p>
       <p>
        ThinkSleep and ThinkPillow are combined together to create a perfect sleep system. Through sleep data analysis, ThinkSleep offers the sleeper suggestions to improve their rest. If the decline of sleep quality is caused by the improper condition of the pillow, ThinkSleep will suggest you to adjust the height and firmness of the ThinkPillow, so as to meet your personal requirements and to reach the best sleep experience.

        ThinkSleep is a professional sleep creation product. Compared with some existing wearable smart sleep products, it has additional advantages such as; non-wearable, added Before-sleep Event Marker, comprehensive statistics, remote sleep tracking of family members, smarter alarm clock, perfect combination with ThinkPillow and easy-to-use UI design.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wearable devices when sleeping will make people feel uncomfortable which may seriously affect the quality of sleep. In these cases sleep tracking can often become meaningless. Sleep enhancement technology should be something that exists and changes our life without disturbing us. Based on this concept, ThinkSleep comes into being.
       </p>
       <p>
        ThinkSleep has two important functions, firstly, sleep management; secondly, smart alarm .
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Sleep Management:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        1. Recording sleep status
       </p>
       <p>
        ThinkSleep can specifically track your sleep behavior and display all the detailed daily sleep data in your smart phone APP, including history records, monthly and annual data.
       </p>
       <p>
        2. Before-Sleep Event Marker
       </p>
       <p>
        ThinkSleep creatively includes the before sleep event marking function, through which you can mark the exciting things you do 3 hours before sleep, such as drink alcohol, coffee, take medicine or do exercise. By analyzing the historical data, the ThinkSleep APP will tell you which behaviors can help you sleep and which may affect your sleep quality. According to this, you can change the bad habits so as to improve your sleep.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. A Sleep Keeper of Your Family or Close Friends
       </p>

        It allows you to care more about your family in an often overlooked, yet critical aspect of our lives. The sleep data of your relatives will be uploaded to the Cloud of lovethink.com, or be directly sent to your APP through Bluetooth. With no need to be shared in social networks, you can check the sleep data of your relatives on your phone any time and any where. This is wonderfully helpful to assist your care of elderly friends and family. If you notice that a loved ones sleep behavior is abnormal over a certain period, you will be able to identify and assist prevention of possible illnesses and maladies. The ThinkSleep APP can also automatically safeguard sleeping patterns and will alert you of poor sleep trends, so if need be, you can make a trip to the doctor as soon as possible.

        <b>
         Smart Alarm:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        <img src="https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041933/files/20141124011236-_9.jpg?1416820356" style="max-width:620px;"/>
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p>
       </p>
       <div>
        Smart alarm clock will trigger the alarm at the perfect point in your sleep cycle during the 30 minutes before the set alarm time. If the ThinkSleep detects that you are stirring shortly before your alarm goes off, it will wake you then, rather than waiting, as you could well slip back into a deep sleep.
        <br/>
       </div>
       <div>
        <p>
         <img src="https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1041935/files/20141124011327-IMG_1902.JPG?1416820407" style="max-width:620px;"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, the set alarm time is 6:30, then from 6:00 to 6:30, the smart alarm clock will make a judgment according to your sleep status. If you are rousing from sleep during that period, the alarm clock can wake you up then instead of waiting for the set time, preventing from falling deeper into sleep again only to force you awake later feeling terrible (all of a sudden calling it an "alarm" just doesn't seem right!).
        </p>
        <p>
         In another instance, if you are in the deep sleep status during the pre-alarm period, the smart alarm clock will make a short vibration 15 minutes before the set alarm time to enable you to slowly transfer from deep sleep to light sleep, before triggering the alarm at the set time. In this case, you will be woken from a light sleep status which is a much more merciful morning call experience!
        </p>
        <p>
         If you do not want to get up even though the alarm is triggered, turn off the alarm clock just with a double-tap on the ThinkSleep. The awkwardness of looking everywhere for the alarm clock with closed eyes will no longer happen to you because the ThinkSleep is beside you now and it won't disturb others sleep.

          Design of ThinkSleep
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         ThinkSleep has an elegant appearance with black and white as its main color, it is very simple, small, even beautiful. It contains a 3-axis sensor, a small speaker, vibrating motor and a rechargeable battery with standby time for up to 3 months inside. Data transmitting with Smartphone through Bluetooth leads to its strong power in cloud data processing

        <p>
         The customizable pillow case is designed with great care. Simple graceful design blends with gray and blue colors harmoniously.
        </p>
        <p>
         It simply attaches to your ThinkPillow or normal pillow and invisibly tracks your sleep at night. You don't need to put on any uncomfortable "wearables" or press a button. ThinkSleep knows when you're falling asleep, soundly asleep, thrashing about, or waking up. Everything.

        The index profile for ThinkPillow is a para-curve. The coordinates for softness and height can be freely adjusted. In response to individual differences, the index moves along the curve. The index profile for ordinary pillows is a straight line. As an analogy. It is a painful ordeal to wear the shoes of the same size regardless of the individual differences.

          The ThinkPillow Story
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         Why did I want to invent the ThinkPillow? To begin with my father, he often slept badly at night because of his cervical spondylosis. From research, I found that my father had been using a bad pillow for sleeping, which led to the injury of his spine. So I decided to make a special pillow that would be conducive to my fathers sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         After two years of hard work, I finally managed to invent a pillow that is the ThinkPillow, as we called it. I gave the ThinkPillow to my father as a gift on his birthday, from there on in, dad's sleep problem was solved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then I realized that there are a lot of people with sleep woes like my father in the world, so I continued to develop the ThinkPillow to create a product that could help anyone achieve a good nights rest.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Next Steps
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         The molds of the system's parts have been built and we have completed product and software application development and testing. We are now ready for mass production, but the factory needs a minimum order quantity to produce, so we come to Indiegogo to ask for help. We hope you believe in the benefit of the ThinkPillow enough to support us, so we can help to change the way we sleep forever.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Only The Best Quality
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         The ThinkPillow team has been working in the industrial manufacturing with global corporations for more than 10 years and we have deep experience in bringing innovative, successful products to market.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have already invested one year of research to ensure the very best materials and the most innovative, compatible design.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vast majority of our raw materials for the ThinkPillow have been imported from USA, Germany and Japan. Such as the filling micro-balls , button balls as well as the airbag filling. Also we have 100% ensured they have met the highest level of international environmental standards, an absolute must for a product that serves such an intimate role.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our staff will be stationed in the production outlets to monitor the assembly process, to ensure we deliver the highest quality products. We will then test, one by one, with a 3rd party quality control and compliance house to ensure each product passes the most stringent standards before it leaves the factory.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h2>
         Risks and challenges
        </h2>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         ThinkPillow is a little more complicated than an average adjustable pillow. As it is composed of several parts, these components are produced in separate factories and therefore the foremost consideration is production management and quality assurance between the locations.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Particular attention is required to ensure quality control for the production of the ThinkPillows key components. Our staff will be stationed on site at these locations to ensure consistent standards of manufacturing and our 48 hour test cycle policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Naturally there will always be risks in any venture; however by implementing stringent production safeguards and conducting a deep level of research, we've dramatically reduced these risks by developing a reliably manufactured product that will actually revolutionize your sleep (and more importantly waking) experience! On top of this, we are 100% committed to our product and are ready to address any possible issues that may come our way.
