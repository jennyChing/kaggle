Jews traded throughout the Fertile Crescent, beyond the Land of Israel, and wherever individuals went to do business, communities followed. City life created new possibilities for interaction with others. The opportunity to marry someone who wasn't Jewish presented itself frequently, as it does today. The Book of Ruth shows how, as with many other issues, the Bible does not outrightly reject intermarried couples but instead illustrates the complex nature of life.","type":"feed","feedType":"magazine","remoteid":"sid/ibcqpce1z/mzayfert","ssid":{"sid":"ibcqpce1z","authorUsername":"mzayfert","remoteidEnc":"FT7_3cuO1-jtO8ycKkkIffQqu4buqFtbnie6wt-AerU3qLpNgXymfv3eMzoqM0g_4W_3D-IOgXWEREjB_JRPpQbEuUafcCi3LgG-_msl7Jo"},"image":{"smallURL":"http://joi.org/ruth/images/RuthCover.jpg"},"magazineVisibility":"public","socialId":"flipboard-ktmsscGWQw2MAmtzfEl3Zw:m:83157200-1430940578","authorDisplayName":"Marilyn Zayfert","authorUsername":"mzayfert","userid":"83157200","authorImage":{"smallURL":"https://cdn.flipboard.com/uploads/avatar/1cf41edfe3aa8ea104ca241c333866f6cb0e0e41.jpg"}},{"title":"Brooklyn in Da House SxSW Music 2015","description":"Seven bands were chosen prior to SxSW Music 2015 to follow their journey through the festival.
