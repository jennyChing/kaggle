           Why INFJ and ENTP belong together: The science of love, by Chris Race
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A lot of people will say that the theory of meeting your perfect Myers-Briggs type is silly. They are mistaken. Here is why you should take this stuff seriously.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I am an ENTP and here is my story. If there is anywhere on the internet where this will do good please post it. Use my words to help others. I chose this INFJ tribe to post this for reasons that will soon be clear.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When I was young I was in passion with an ISFP. Jessica was a kind soul and I was young and in love. At the same time there was a coworker named Katie that was an INFJ. She was really cool and I liked her. We just hit it off. I could talk to her about anything and she not only understood me, she seemed actually appreciative of my intuitional advice and crazy theories. I fell in love with her after my breakup, but I didnt tell her because she was married by then. She married an ISTP who was a contentious jerk. I could go on and on about why I hate him, but lets just leave it at cheated by having cybersex on his worthless video games and still locks her out of the computer while taking the weekend off as a father and Didnt give her a honeymoon even though he promised 10 years ago. I watched in horror as she got married and lost so much control over her life she cleaned knobs obsessively. I think it was the only control over her environment she had at the time.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I got married and I didnt trust my feelings. Katie didnt have to know how I felt. It is pointless to tell her I thought. Even a week before getting married I felt like I wished I were marrying her. What good would come of telling her now. I was worried she might think less of me for making such a huge mistake my ex-wife ate my self-esteem for lunch, and I didnt I deserved anything better. I didnt feel capable of helping Katie anymore. I kept my distance from them. He enraged me when he told her good teachers dont have time to be adequate mothers and I distanced myself..She quit teaching, a profession she loved, so she could have babies and I didnt even want to be in the same room with that worthless piece of crap husband of hers. I convinced myself that he enraged me enough that I couldnt think clearly enough to help her. I was also busy licking my own marital wounds and protecting myself from anger.
           <br/>
           When I discovered Myers-Briggs personality typing, it opened up an entire world of possibilities to me. People were actually different from me and there was a reason and a science to study and understand them. This began a life change. I began to use psychology to help my students and try to keep my angry wife happy. I learned you cant make someone happy the hard way, but I learned a great amount of diplomatic skill for a NT- in the process.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           After I divorced I told Katie how I felt. I think she knew, she indicated the felt bound by vow. I dont even know if she loves her husband. I cant see how she could. I support her anyway and sent her Liberated Parents, Liberated Children. Sibblings without Rivalry (both by Faber and Mazlish) and 8 lessons for a Happier marriage by Dr. William Glasser. I highly recommend them all LPLC changed my life. It helped me grow up by seeing my defense mechanism I picked up as a child and shed them. Its OK to trust my feeling now.
           <br/>
           I didnt trust my feelings and, for now, I am alone. I am much happier than I was. I thought to myself that if I was going to find true love than I should trust my instincts. I knew there was something about the INFJ that I needed. I had to teach myself out of this cuture of sex and pleasure just to learn what love is and Katie taught me that. I think it is very sad we dont teach children important lessons that help communication. Everyone should at least know their type of person. Kids should know that there is a type that makes communication so easy it feels like love without effort.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So whats the science behind this? I read a lot of posts and one thing I think that is so misunderstood about temperament is the concepts of what I will call the 4 skills. There are 2 deciding methods: thinking and feeling and 2 input methods: sensing and intuition that our brain computer uses. You can take in information through your senses directly, or by putting 2 things together with your intuition. You see a painting with your senses, you figure out its a Van-Gogh by comparing it to other pictures you know using your intuition. You choose a car based on your pros and cons thinking assessment or by how you feel when you drive it.
           <br/>
           I want to talk about those four skills for a moment. Everyone uses all four skills: thinking, feeling, intuition and sensing, but the thing is for most activities you can get by with 2. I am going to call these the strong functions. Some activities we must use our lesser skills for, usually with disastrous results.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So pretend you are a car with your 4 people in it. The strong skills are represented is your driver who has the most skill and the navigator with also pretty good skills. In the back seats are a 12 year old and a 4 year old. When we have to use our lesser functions it is like someone in the back seat taking the wheel.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Another concept that is often misunderstood in Myers-Briggs is the concept of extroverting (showing) or introverting (hiding) a skill. A person who wears their heart on their sleeve is almost certainly extroverted feeling. If you share your thinking or think out loud you are an extroverted thinker. If you extravert thinking you introvert feeling. The same pattern holds for intuition and sensing.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Here is a list of the types and their skill order. Remember introverts show the world their secondary and weak functions extroverts show their dominant and third skills.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           N  intuition s-sensing f-feeling and t-thinking. A capital letter means that skill extroverted.

           <br/>
           INTP  tNsF
           <br/>
           <br/>
           For many of you this will fill in a lot of the questions about how relationship dynamics work. A personality type is rather static in that it only describes the person. These functions can help us to understand the science of love.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As a side note these skills are key to helping you to type others well. A person who wears their heart on their sleeve is either FJ or TP and those types are VERY different. So if a person show feelings easily and you can tell TP and FJ apart, you can limit the personality possibilities from 16 down by 4 and those are 2 pairs of I/E differences
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Another useful side note this new framework offers is it explains the I/E difference. You may have noticed that sometimes introverts and extroverts I/E can be hard to tell apart. We all feel good when we can use are most dominant functions. Also, when talking and interacting with others we use only the skills we extrovert. Notice how the promoter ESTP and the Crafter ISTP both show their feelings and sensing. The crafter just has less skill with the traits he shows. This gives introverts their distinctive quietness. The crafter only get to use his amazing thinking when he is not busy talking to others. So its tiring to talk to others for him, but not for the promoter.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Back to the Science of Love. The ENTP and INFJ were meant to be together because the ENTP shares his intuition all the time. Most people  do not like to hear intuitions and theory they don't understand in conversations. The INFJ has the same skill at idea generation that the ENTP has. When the ENTP talks, the INFJ can listen and understand his very advanced intuitions. INFJs and ENTPs both like systems. The INFJ finds people systems more interesting; the ENTP systems of things. When they communicate something special happens. The ENTP talks and the INFJ comprehends and listens automatically. That means the ENTP feels listened to and completely understood. I cant begin to describe with words how amazing that feels as an ENTP. The INFJ really likes the insight, learning, and informative nature of the ENTP brings about the world around them.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Likewise when the INFJ shows even the slightest hint of emotional distress the ENTP picks up on it and wants to help. He feels empowered to be able to help, and she empowered by another possible solution.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The INFJ starts things the ENTP wants to get them done to please her. Most TPs are notorious people pleasers. The ENTP takes this to mean that she wants help. Afterall she actually LIKES to listen to his professor-babble help, and he likes helping others and seeing them happy so both parties bask in the shared intuition and many problems seems to melt away.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           For me anyway I feel like a man without a soul. I feel incomplete, and mostly misunderstood. I hate that I am cant be more clear when explaining things verbally. I have to communicate though intuition that annoys people and feelings I dont quite grasp to communicate my thoughts. (It's that frustration that lead me down this road to understanding) The INFJ knows what the ENTP means and can communicate well with others. The ENTP can protect the INFJ from being taken advantage of with their built-in bullcrap detector. The match is perfect.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           They are ying and yang. The same is true for all types. Your perfect match shares the N or S with you and every other letter is different. For example the ISTPs match is ESFJ and the ENFJs match is the INTP. Each match completes the other. Even the ENFJ would not be as suited for the ENTP because the level of intuition does not match the ENTP so the ENTP feels listened to, but not fully understood. The ENTP will feel obligated to over-explain things to the strong, but not infinitely patient ENFJ.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The key to this is not so much the T/F difference. I saw an INFJ who was in a struggling relationship with an ENTJ. Thats only one letter off from a perfect match, yet this INFJ felt the T/F was the cause of misery in her relationship. It wasnt. Its the way he communicated feelings was VERY different than the ENTP. The ENTJ introverts his weakest function: feelings. ENTJs often dont even know how they feel much less be able to put it in words and accurately and describe its intensity. Many are almost incapable of accepting feelings of others they think are not justified and views emotion almost on par with manipulation.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The ENTJs style does not lend itself for emotional exchanges without someone more patient, selfless and understanding. The INFPs serene face betrays the war raging way inside over good and evil. Many INFPs punish themselves as children feeling they deserve it. The ENTJs bulldozer style and the INFPs ability to take punishment make the relationship whole.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           By contrast, The ENTP loves to talk about feelings, has some skill at doing so and wants to please people. Any way you slice it that is 180 from the ENTJ, and if you dont believe me you can ask my ex-wife who loved to find fault and punish me by yelling at me for not being up to standard. I quit drinking and soon the fight was about drinking too much soda. Only a monk, an INFP could handle a relationship like that.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As a rule both perfect matches should share both introverted or entroverted feelings, and split how they introvert/extrovert intuition and senses. When they do the couple enjoys AMAZING, almost effortless, communication. Some couples will be able to work together despite these differences. People can work well together who share the one wavelength and have more similar temperaments, but only one type is a perfect match in regard to communication.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Some couples cant work together. I shared neither wavelength with my ENTJ ex-wife. Ready assemble furniture was a nightmare. She was thinking out loud and I had to listen so I couldnt think for myself. VERY frustrating for a natural problem solver. We were very similar people who couldnt even assemble an end table together. She would ask me what I thought but I cant think when I am listening. My frustration shows as I extrovert my feeling, she doesnt want to have to deal with emotions. I try to tell her I am upset because I need time to think when she asks me that's all, she feels incompetent and thinks there is no way I should feel that strongly enough to actually show that much emotion as much as I do. Introverted feelings people sometimes perceive the extroverted feelings and wavelength as over-emotional. And in the case of this ENTJs weakest skill was to interpret that as manipulation. What do you expect from having feelings as the weakest function? It was a train wreck waiting to happen.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Dont date outside your type. I mean it. I used to think that it would be good enough to find someone who was an ENFJ or maybe I could be ok with an ISFJ. You cant have a perfect communication match without the right combination of skills. I want to feel true love deeply on a level beyond words. I want to find my soul mate. She is INFJ. Everyone should have this knowledge and be able to find true love more efficiently. :)
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As for me my INFJ is out there somewhere, and I have hope and confidence I will find her.
           <br/>

           Now before I get thanked for sharing (That still amazes me that people actually want to read my stuff) I want to thank you INFJs. I know there isnt a better forum out there where me posting this would do more good. I thank you for listening and helping people who arent all that nice in return. If this helps you to help or understand just one more person, it was all worth it to me. Thank YOU.

             Chris,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             That was a very honest and open post. And yes, thank you for the in depth perspective on this. I have to admit I am not one to delve deeply into the science behind the Myers Briggs, but I can't deny the truth in how accurate INFJ is for me. I need to spend some time digesting everything you wrote.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I hope you find your INFJ and you certainly have been brave in reaching out to Katie and being as helpful as you can. I was in a horrible marriage for many years with an abusive husband and used the same excuse about my vows. I kept telling myself that I had chosen this and needed to make the best of it. I am free of that thanks to him deciding he wanted out. I't amazing how the real misery of such a situation isn't truly apparent until you get out. The analogy of "you don't know how much it really hurts until you stop hitting yourself on the head with a hammer" is pretty accurate. I am happier now than I have ever been and can't imagine what life would be like if that marriage had survived. Not sure I would be alive.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Thanks for your post.

             Great post, very well thought out. :) Part of it blew my mind because it ran parallel to my life in a way.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             First off, my name is Katie and I'm an INFJ :). When I was younger I was pretty shy, but one day in a Target I had a love at first sight kind of moment and found myself talking to a guy working there. His name was Chris. We were fast friends and could talk to each other about everything. We dated but his mom didn't approve because I was still in high school and he wasn't. There was a three year difference. 16 and 19. So he stopped talking to me. Broke my heart. He had become my best friend and when it ended I took it hard. I eventually settled into dating an old boyfriend, that I wasn't very passionate about but had never hurt me. I ended up getting married to him right after high school. He was going to Iraq and I had never really dated anyone but him and Chris seriously. I was desperate to just settle down with a nice guy. I am a very modest person and was as innocent as is possible, and I was very scared of the idea of dating.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Me and this guy got married and I waited for him to get back from Iraq. I was very dutiful and tried to set up a household for him to return to. When he returned things went sour. He became very verbally abusive and destroyed my tenuous self esteem. Mind you I was 18 and 19 at the time so it wasn't difficult for life to bring me down. He was addicted to World of Warcraft and would play it all through out the night and then go to work and then return and repeat said cycle. I tried to reach out to him but eventually the verbal abusiveness turned physical. When I asked him to choose between me and the game, he chose the game. When I left him he became frightening. At one point while getting my stuff he attacked me and tried to choke me out. Only my screams (it was in an apartment so near other people) saved me.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Later that year, a day before the finalization of my divorce, I felt free but quite traumatized. I couldn't imagine dating, or trusting another individual. I was finding quite a bit of happiness just improving and learning. That day I was at a Walmart when I heard someone say, "Are you doing all right?" Without thinking, (I know part of me must have recognized his voice) I said, "No, no I'm not." rather abruptly. I turned around and time seemed to stop as we stared at each other in surprise.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It had been four years since we had seen each other and I had convinced myself that he was a horrible person and hadn't cared for me at all when I was younger. I couldn't figure out why over the years I never got over him despite the short span of our relationship. I had long decided if the time came I would let him suffer by telling him off or something.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             But suddenly he became human in my eyes again as he stuttered and stammered to have a conversation with me. He asked for my phone number and said he had thought about me all the time over the years and would like to start over. To be friends again.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I wanted to say no...but we made a date.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             On that date we fell in love. He told me no matter who he dated he always compared them to me. He could never stop thinking of me. We even found out that the same songs on the radio made us think of each other over the years. The words "I love you," literally left our mouths. It was a strange sort of magic, it felt surreal. I had never felt happier or more peacefull in my life. I had found my soulmate, and we have been together every day since.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             haha, okay overshare and all. But alot of things in your experience reminded me of parts of me and my husbands love story. And I thought it might be nice if you knew that somewhere in this world an INFJ Katie got her Chris. :)

               I can only speak for myself, but I do really appreciate talking about systems, interactions and learning and making connections without necessarily jumping to a resolute conclusion as maybe other types would. I think this is basically what you said, talking with intuition. This is an area I mostly feel unfullfilled in.

               I will be happy to reply and expound.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               ISFP's like aesthetics and I am a decent looking guy. (that's tongue in cheek self-aggrandizement.)
               <br/>
               <br/>
               In normal speak: She thought I was cute and she goes for that sort of thing.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               This was my first meaningful relationship and I was In luck. She was cute and waaaay more than a nerd like I ever deserved. This is a time in my life where physical beauty was of primary importance to me because I had never connected with anyone mentally or emotionally before. I was young and in college.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               She has feelings as her primary function. Loving deeply was important to her. I took for granted her love. I was madly in love with her. She was sometimes a bit, well, dopey. She usually hid it well, but one time she came to me and said "did you know the sun is a star?" "I told her to keep that to herself, the world isn't ready for it yet" and she looked pleased to know. I find awed and astounded -SFP's to be inspiring because I love wonder. The tradeoff to being awed a lot is to be well, a little slow about how some things technically work, smart in other ways.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I remember once per month she would attempt to start fights with me. I saw it coming but each time a fight about petty things would ensue. She was venting rage at me inside her for not being able to understand her. I think this is because At the time for me if you didn't "look" like you felt sad and said you were sad it wasn't real to me. I was evidence based and in a very me perspective. Everyone shows emotion same as me mindset. No major outward emotion meant to me "you don't really feel that way". Denial of feelings and scathing skepticism resulted from her best attempts at telling me what was bothering her.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I Could not read her deep introverted feeling. When ISFP's get very angry they become very quiet and may fantasize violence. at least that's what me best friend since 6 ISFP says. I can only imagine the violence she fantasized on me before the end. My not giving her a corner on her soul and denial of feelings ended the relationship. she moved away then broke it off. Quite a feat for an artisan to end it.  My ignorance of the complexities of human nature really made the relationship all about me. She was kind of in it for a stable place to live, though not at first. They were all deal breakers in progress.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I have since then dated an ESFP. By being completely sincere with ALL of my emotions were were able to create a stable pair. I use choice theory and so I strive for a non-coercive relationship, which she loved. I accepted her less obvious feelings as valid at great personal stress to me, but when she was angry and working though it, I felt extremely uncomfortable with her introverted feeling.  She would be cynical about my ideas about a subject and tended to always take an agnostic approach to every topic. She didn't think any one could know the best stance to take so she didn't take them. I found this ok in theory, but in practice it felt like she was cynical about all new ideas. She didn't trust learning that wasn't from experience (being extremely high sensing ) so sometimes she found trusting my intuition to be a gamble.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I found myself absorbed with her. She had a way of amping people up and after a while I want calm because I am a -NT-. During the getting things going phase of the relationship we did well. We overcame obsticals with minimal effort and created a stable home quickly. In time I felt anxious and amped. I did not get as much done so I felt unhappy. Rationals -NT- need achievement to feel good about themselves, but I found myself lost in playtime with her. Not that it wasn't the most fun I have ever had in a relationship, but I broke it off because I was looking for something deeper.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I think the relationship would eventually deteriorate. The ENTP just can't pay enough attention to the ESFP for both of them to be satisfied physically and mentally. Its a tradeoff. A better match for the Performer Artisan ESFP is the inspector gaurdian ISTJ. The hardest kind to get to crack a smile. Nothing delights an ESFP more than a tough cookie who "can't" smile with a lot of stability.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               She was very mature about the breakup. ESFP's are tactical and can hold a grudge... so you never know. I am watching my back but hopeful to keep her as a friend.

                 What a heart warming post! Hey Chris, I was wondering what your thoughts would be about this model (
                 <a href="http://www.socionics.com/rel/relcht.htm)" title="www.socionics.com/rel/relcht.htm)">
                  www.socionics.com/rel/relcht.htm)
                 </a>
                 I would be fascinated to hear what you think about it! In this model it said that your most compatible match is with an ISFP(long term interactions) which intrigued me even more as I read about your past relationship with one. Socionics has a pretty eccentric twist on personality compatibility. As I learned about this model I began to shake uncontrollably because it very accurately summed up my exact interactions with other types. I am an INFJ. It may be tried and true for me, but I have yet to know its accuracy for other people.

             Great post...! I've been surfing the Web recently for some romantic matching via Myers Briggs type. I'm an infj guy who had an awful time finding mates that I'm really attracted to on all levels.

             I will try and hone my typing skills and keep a look out for an entp!

               An ENTP wears her heart on her sleave and is an easy emotional read. Is socially awkward. Seems insincere, but is actually charming and not the other way around. Atheist and agnostic meetups as well as math professors might be places to look. Dating websites are likely to have good profiles. Look for someone who writes a lot and may include some negatitivity but not too much. "Living day by day" Is not an ENTP phrase. Don't be afraid to be direct in person. "I would like to get to know you. Would you like to go out for coffee." Its simple, but all too often I hear stories of INFJ's that would not overcome their introversion and don't reach out to those who understand them. Mostly it seems they are afraid by how quickly they reach a sort of intimacy and worry about their partner seeing all. ( ENTP's will likely not realize you are their kind of person right away, but they will notice conversation with you flows so smoothly.) When they notice you might be best served by asking them out and not letting the opportunity pass. Remember that drama queens and ESTPs want you to see them like you want to see them. Beware the charmer whose intentions you do not fully trust. They look like ENTP's and will use you up if you don't trust yourself. They are masters of image destabilization. If you do trust them communication should go smoothly and be stable over time. There is an ENTP tribe if that helps..

                 <br/>
                 i am an ENTP lady, i have been with a somewhat similar relationship with an ESFJ male. he is now married and very unhappy( but  i don't want to mingle in his personal affairs). our emotional and mental connection is so effortless. much as we have we have wished each other a good life, we often call each other and meet to share our troubles and joys, successes and failures and of late our feelings and it comes so naturally.
                 <br/>
                 does gender play any role in the science of love? what do u have to say about the ENTP/ESFJ match? what other matches suits the ENTP other than ISFJ? (knowing they are quite rare to come across)

                   I can't say I have studied gender and types as well as I would like. Gender usually plays more of a role around sex. Particularly in style and approach. A Male idealist is much more likely to see love sooner, and that makes sense biologically. The social complexities of gender along with the rest are tougher.

                   I am not sure is you mistyped. Your perfect match is INFJ and those are quite rare. The ISFJ protector gaurdian is likely to give you moral judgements and be clueless about anything that is theoretical that you would find interesting. You want to share your theoretical nature with a mate so you are looking for a INFJ. I wouldn't settle for less. You will recognize how he asks you to expound on your ideas and how good that feels. I really would not waste time looking for any other type in a lifemate.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   I am actually a little curious about your last relationship. I can't imagine a relationship with a provider gaurdian, especially one with an intellectual connection. I'd register all of their emotions, especially the negative ones toward my ideas. I am surprised the relationship lasted as long and you ended on as good terms as you did. Are you sure he was ESFJ? Did he wear his heart on his sleeve but then not want to talk about his emotion. Was he master of the guilt trip? Did he want to take care of everything then say you should X because he did Y? Did he argue about seemingly petty things and bicker? He would have been into some gossip (maybe not as much as a guy) and would have been terrible at strategizing. You would have made him feel stupid and he would have been sensitive about it.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   I don't date sensors. Its a personal rule. They aren't deep like you want them to be. The relationship has almost zero growth potential after it has been established. It sucks. I wouldn't date another rational as rationals tend to grow apart from each other with time. I have a rational EX wife to prove it. No for me I guess I would rather date someone I can have fluid communication with.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   The INFJ, if you have met one you will understand how good it feels to talk about the things everyone else hates to hear you say. The things you think about that are important to you and everyone wishes you'd  just shut up about the INFJ WANTS to hear. You will feel love quickly with them. The deference and acceptance is worth the search. You might have to break convention and make the first move. (As a fellow ENTP I am sure you are delighted) If he is an INFJ he'll smooth over any awkwardness and nervousness you have in his response.

                     Chris, Jared here. I stumbled onto this site by accident because I have been gathering all types of information on relationship dynamics and since I am an ENTP I was hoping to see if I could get a better understanding of how the world views us.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Let me first say, as a person who sees the world through the same frame (I try not to refer to the 4 letter functions as a 'personality type') I must say I am a bit surprised to find a person, who despite living a world away (I'm in Mississippi) had a similar experience to my own.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     For I too, met my natural partner (online though) and she was alas, taken by a guy who didn't love her, in a pointless marriage. Without getting into too much detail there since she forbade me to mention it, and it took a long time for me to gain her trust (although it was worth it) I found we clicked really well. She appreciated my idea, and in return when she was trying to help her friends, I naturally wouldn't let anyone take advantage of her. I do hope to go out and meet her someday, and I am working on myself now so that I will be ready.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     However, prior to all this I happened to stumble across a couple of books you should be very proud I came on here to save you with and share with you. I'm hoping it will help you out in the same way, and most of those questions you have about the psychology part of relationships and what not and the thing you couldn't answer about, the Gender Roles. I'm getting ready to use all my knowledge in a lecture with a couple religious guys, so I am needing real world examples to help back up my case about how things are NOT random or happen by accident, and we truly are very predictable people (despite the fact judgers have a tough time picking up our perceptive ways).
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     I also want you to know you are indeed onto something with this post, and it transcends far beyond the things you mentioned, into aspects of bullying, cheating in relationships, communication style awareness, and a list of other things. I hope you keep an open mind, and good predictable luck to you sir.

                     <br/>
                     I do not know if you are still active on this tribe but I had to join up and say that what you have written makes much sense and I have had the same experience with an esfj. I am finally throwing the towel in but it took me forever and I would try to self diagnose what the problem is. I finally had decided that Enfp would be a good match because they get our need for soulful connection and the other thing but sometime for all their brains the do not want reason and call it argumentation. So I think that entp would be the best fit for infjs and I think more people should take this seriously as it would stop them from serious pain.

                 I am an infj and currently married to estp. I have been having issues with him and spoke to him about it but does not want to let go. When I did seperate from him he went psychotic and i had to call the cops. I don't know what to do because his good friend is an entp and we have a great connection but I haven't been up front with him and did not know he was an entp till now. I want to pursue my connection with him but afraid that my husband will have his episode again. My husband loves me a lot and I love him but there is connection. My husband is showing signs of OCD and I sometimes question his sexuality. He has an inferior complex and always finds ways to force himself through life for example relationships. If I am up front with the entp all feelings will be hurt and having a hard time to deal with that.  I don't know what to do.

             I am not sure if I've ever crossed paths with an ENTP before or not. Maybe I just did not recognize them. I am no longer sure if INFJ's are a new step in evolution or a dying character type. I mean 1-3% of the population? We are so seriously out numbered. Your story is very common however, it may be because of my own maturity level, the story is just way too tragic and self-destructive. Why anyone would choose to pursue or pine for a relationship of that nature is beyond my understnading. It may be a very romantic notion, but knowing your negative traits should assist you in becoming more aware of your own pitfalls. I  know knowing (finally) my personality type and my short comings I have spent years overcoming my own inclinations. It's hard work, but it makes you a much healthier individual.

             Good luck.

             I am really trying not to bawl right now.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I am an INFJ and I am completely in love with a colleague of mine who is an ENTP. He has a fiance, though. So many of the things you have written really resonate with me. My ENTP and I clicked immediately when we met and I am more open with him than anyone in my life right now. I can't help it. I want to tell him everything. That's never happened to me before - I am always so private and I lie often to avoid revealing my true feelings. I find lying very easy. I cannot lie to him though, he always knows. I walk in to the office and he will know immediately if something is wrong. He amazes me with how in tune he is with my moods. I often wonder if that is a personality trait?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Everyone that has seen us together has noticed our connection and several people have asked me and my ENTP (separately) if we are having an affair because ... well, maybe we seem "into" each other? But I am so confused about everything because I am not sure if he really has any serious feelings for me or if he just appreciates our conversations and banter. Sometimes he is EXTREMELY flirtatious, but he can switch if off very quickly and neutralise a complimentary or lascivious comment.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I really need to move on and get over it because he is getting married, but then he does something that makes me think maybe I am not captaining the Titanic and there is something here. I'm actually considering leaving my place of employment to remove myself from the situation because absence does work for me, in "getting over" people. I just want to know what he is thinking, but I can't work it out. I am usually so good at understanding people and their motivations and intentions towards me, but I can't see it.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sorry, I'm waffling. I just couldn't help it, reading your post was like reading my own thoughts reversed.

             I have known entp for a couple of years now and I have always had a great connection with him, Our communication is solely based on intuition where he speaks and I listen. I comphrend everything he tells me and sometimes don't like what he says but listen anyway to better myself.  This time when we did meet I felt a little scared by his presence.  He is so grounded and sure of himself which reminds me of how I use to be.  Over the years lost touch with myself and dying to be me again.  Sometimes I get caught up with the ST and SF trying hard to be just like them.  Seeing that I am an infj hardly unlikely have to be true to myself and show the world what I have  to offer.   I have to approach my life with taking the right steps and conquer my fears.  Entp's are smart, funny, lovable and very clever I might add but fun to be around.  My next step will be to approach him directly and start conversations with him and see where that takes us.  I tend to be a little more introverted than usual around him the connection I have with him is so unique than other cOnnections I had with other people in my life.  I have maybe 4-5great friends that I have been friends with for years I luv them alot have always been loyal and committed to the relationship, when I don't call they totally understand me and let it go.  For me right now need to be with my friends so I can let my guard down and be myself.

               As an infj we take everything in and sometimes forget who we are.  Infj can't see unjustice or other people being treated differently.  Always can read when someone is being unfair or unreasonable.  I have had to see this happen a couPle of times in my life. Where I use to work didn't like what i saw especially when coming from companies than build inspiration and good knowledge through coaching and special attention.  Ended up working for a cOmpany that didn't do all this instead closed off communication and had a very old school type Of managing.  Closed doors and no goals or mission in the company.  I communicated this to higher level of management and they didn't seem to care a job was a job to them.  I went ahead anyways and changed the environment of the company and helped the staff be alot happier when they came to work and created harmony between the staff. I sometimes got a little carried away didn't realise what I was doi g at the time but did get alot of appreciation from it. The HR director use to call me Hitler and was soon approached by the CEO to do some work for him.  I took on alot of responsibilities more than I could handle but they liked that about me.  I find myself easier to help others when they are unhappy or fustrAted and sometimes hard to deal with immediate family get to emotionally involved and give up sometimes.

             I'm a INFJ and when I was 18 I met a boy on the Internet, and he's an ENTP. The very first time I chat with him on msn, I knew that this boy is unique. I was hooked and wanted to learn everything about him. He is Turkish and I Swedish. We chat everyday after school for hours and hours, writing to each other about everything. I loved his honesty, his zest for the world, and the way he put his wordings. Unlike many other (guys) he had great patience with me; he let me share and open myself to him in my own phase, always making me feel very comforable. I did not have to care about conventions or other superficial rituals when chatting with him. We had each other and that was it. Later we started university, he decided to go for medicine. It surpriced me coz he had no interest in alturistic deeds; in fact, he was very selfish and did not hide it. I understood he did it coz of the prestige and money, and I also thought that he might come to enjoy it later when he once get started with his studies. Years past and he never found passion for his chosen studies or future profession. He never attended class and cheated on every exam. He had great charisma and great social abilities so he could convince anybody about anything. This "relaxed" and manipulative characteristic of his was something that I struggled with. We almost never argued, but the times we did was becuase of I thought he was immoral and unethical. He lacked principles and always tried to be liked by others "follow the streem". He never wanted to take responsibilities for his actions or things happening to him. Thorughout our relationship, I felt like I often had to function as his moral compass, his shrink and rational mind. He required alot of attention, and I never asked for the same in return, but he loved me as deeply as I loved him. Despite his 'less attractive' qualities, I knew that he was always honest with me. He always included me; asked me for my opinions and advice. Although he did not care much for other people than himself, I knew he cared about me, and that was all I required. He struggled with his studies a great deal, a lot more than he gave apperance of. He tried to find a way out of his dreary future, so he joined the medical student union. He took every chance to join meetings and parties, travelled to many different places. I did not mind because I wanted him to "learn", to become the best he could be. He made great advancemt and many years later he managed to get an internship in WHO. I was very happy for him, but our last time together, he was a complete mess. One day he wanted to be a zen munk the next he wanted to become America's next President. All the years when he had to struggle to make things fitt had took its tool on him and I did not know what to do. After six years in an intense reltionship he wanted to end it by text message on  phone. I insited to do it in person. After a Skype chat he agreed (he was  in Switzerland and I in Sweden). I wanted him to for once, take full responsibility of one action. Then as we continued talking on phone and text, he thought that we might solve it anyway. I was already heart broaken and I did not know anything anymore. I had given him everything I had. And despite his despicable behaviour, I knew why he had acted the way he did; I knew him better than he knew himself, and I still loved him deeply.  I knew that it was up to me whether our relationship would continue or not. I decided to do as he initially wanted: to break up. I did not wanted things to become wors between us. I did not want him to start to blame our relationship for present and future hardships in his life. I wanted him to be in a situation where he has absolutely no one else than himself ot turn to: give him a sense of being sole responisble for his life. Unlike me, he had no sense of the devision between himself and the outer world: he only wanted to consume it, but in fact it consumed him. So I decided to "let us slip away". I still doubt my decision. I doubt that he'll ever "learn" what I wanted. This is how my very passionate realtionship was like with  a wonderful ENTP. I had never felt that way for anybody before, and I have still not found anyone like him. I wonder if I'll ever will experience that kind of intimate bond again. I really hope I will. Good luck to all of you.
