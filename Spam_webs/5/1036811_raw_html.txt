                There has been debate in the media about whether this Khorosan Group is even a real thing, but this week FBI Director James Comey warned that they could be working hard on a plan to launch an attack within the United States. Not only that, Comey said, but they might be looking to do it very, very soon.
               </p>
               <p>
                Given our visibility, we know theyre serious people, bent on destruction, Comey said on CBSs
                <em>
                 60 Minutes
                </em>
                Sunday. He wasnt exactly clear whether he was talking about military intelligence or a kind of outsiders best guess, but its another of those stark warnings that have begun to pop up with inordinate frequency. A cynical critic could claim (and they have) that this is diversion. With the mid-terms approaching, this president wants a public focused on fear. But those claims ring hollow with this administration. For all of his faults, Obama has been almost irresponsibly reluctant to pull the war card. For him to suddenly renounce everything hes stood for this late in the game makes zero sense.
               </p>
               <p>
                So if we agree that the last thing Obama wants is to go back on his word to keep U.S. ground forces out of Syria and Iraq, then the other alternative is that the threats are real. And if theyre mentioning them with regularity on television, it must be with the aim of preparing the populace.
                <em>
                 We have a grave threat at our doorstep, so dont be surprised
                </em>
               </p>
               <p>
                But that doesnt sound quite right, either. Can a country ever be
                <em>
                 prepared
                </em>
                for a terrorist strike? If youd known in August, 2001 that there was increasing terrorist chatter, would it have any way lessened the blow of 9/11? No, human psychology and empathy doesnt work that way.
               </p>

                The third possibility is that theyre trying to prop up the separate, but deadly story that is this Khorasan Group. While insider reports have come out telling us that this is no new thing, that this is just our old friends Al Qaeda, the administration wants them to be something more. Why? Why would it be necessary to suddenly focus on another band of terrorists when weve already got our hands full with ISIS (to say nothing of our neverending efforts in Afghanistan.)?
               </p>
               <p>
                If anything makes sense, it may be that Obama wants a victory. ISIS is not promising that victory anytime soon, if ever. By creating this other threat, though, it opens up the possibility of a smaller victory along the way. Createdestroy. Celebrate.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just in time forwell, well see.
               </p>
               <p>
                Theres always that elusive fourth possibility, and that is that Obama has finally decided to open up the doors a bit in the last years of his presidency. Long derided as one of the most secretive administrations in recent history, maybe this is their attempt to let the sun shine in. Maybe its the contrarians who have it wrong; the Khorosan Group really is a separate, new threat, and they just happen to be a hornets nest we stirred when we went in with guns blazing.
               </p>
               <p>
                Whatever the final answer ends up being, it illustrates something about this administration that is as scary as any conspiracy theory. So mysterious is this family, this cabinet
                <em>
                 this man
                </em>
                that we must question his every move. So often have his words and actions stunned conservative Americans, we can be forgiven for reading between the lines. You have to find sense in all the nonsense somewhere.

                         I seriously doubt there will ever be another presidential election in this country. Even if there is dont be surprised if Hitlery Clinton is elected, voter fraud a nation filled with useful idiots and just to make sure there are enough of them, the Communist party has been actively importing even more of them. Not only that it seems that the majority of government employees support a big and bigger government, I realize any  civilized society needs a government but ours is to the size of imploding

                             Obviously my the site has been hacked by Obama supporters whom are posting crap under my name. I am a 22 year disabled vet and the post is not something I would post, but is the Dreams of Obamas Father whom hated this country.

                             My dear friend, I wish you well. It is not easy being disabled, as I have found in my latter years. But to be so young is so much harder for you. I wish you well and hope you have a Merry Christmas and I send you my good wishes for the new year.

                           The phrase is usually attributed to Lenin.  It is hard to verify, as it is the sort of thing that would likelier be said in conversation than in writing.  (It does not appear in Lenins writings.) Karl Radek (another Bolshevik) quotes Lenin in the following Russian statement:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            , ,          ,    .

                         I believe it was well put when Russias Mr Putin said, Obomba is either a complete idiot, or hes trying his best to destroy the American economy! And from what I can see, the lil halfbreed bastard is doing just that, as America sits back and watches the liberal demoncrats totally destroy what this great country WAS!! Where are all the expert snipers when you really, REALLY need one???

                             Anyone who has read the bible knows what signs to look for.  The living chuurch of God offers free publications, or you can listen to them online for free.  The U.S. and Great Britian in prophesy and the beast of revelation are good. Their bible study on these subjects I would highly recommend.

                             A Jew! I love you people. Were it not for you, I wouldnt have a Savior, and a Friend in Jesus! You are absolutely right, and this is why America, like Israel in 721 B.C., and Judah in 596 B.C., has been handed over to the enemies of our faith; Barrack Hussein Obama and the Muslims. Were finished. I loved this country. I believe with the muslims second term G-d wanted us to set our sights on the second advent now, and not the healing of America. Forget our national pride and set our gaze heavenward, as I believe the Rapture is going to happen very soon. What do you think?

                             I thank GOD that you are calling me a Jew. I pray that He sees me in the same way, that I stand so close to His own people as to be considered one. Jesus would have never gone to the cross if He didnt want to. Were you to read the Bible, you would see that He had the freedom to not be where He was when He was arrested. But because He loves you and me, He chose to go through the pain and agony so we wouldnt have to, provided we make Him our Lord, King and Savior. I love Him. I love the Jewish people, regardless their stance concerning Jesus. Yes, I did hang Jesus on that cross. So did you, and all the rest of mankind, throughout the ages. Our sin hanged Him on the cross, and through that cross He has cleansed us of our sins and freed us from the agony of eternal separation from Him. That is, if you allow Him into your life and let Him reign over it. Do you have Christ? Its hell without Him. Quite literally.

                             Sam and your idea of retribution to the sinner, is to hang a God loving man on a cross and watch him die slowly and in pain. Not my idea of making someone suffer for what others did.

                             Wow, Pamela. Im just cut to the bone. Its terrible that you let your sense of self righteousness surface in such and ugly manner. All of mankind hung Jesus on the cross. If Jews are Jesus killers, (which they arent, because Jesus is very much alive. Praise God!) Then Catholics are Jew killers (which they are, because all the Jews theyve killed under Roman rule are, indeed, dead.) If you are a liberal, which Im suspecting you are, you are indirectly, and probably directly responsible for the death of 1.4 million innocent, little babies a year, through the many programs you support. So, lets talk about making someone suffer for what others did.

                             Sam, in my last comment, a few minutes ago, I tried to be very nice to you. You someone seem to have got blinded with a sense of dislike for me. Not very Christian, but there you go. As for being a Liberal, there is no chance, seen as I am English and do not vote in your elections. People in life might have behaved badly, which made God send his son to save us. But it was only certain people that decided his cruel fate and carried out so cruelly. I could not have done that to another human being. So you cannot blame everybody for his fate. You are so far off line with my. But hatred does blind one, doesnt it.

                             Pamela, Jesus is a Jew, among other lineages, as noted throughout the Old Testament. He gave His life for us, not an American. And yes, I served in the Military, so dont go there, either. If you really have issues as to the identity of GOD based upon my respect for our Jewish brothers and sisters, I would suggest you embrace their culture a bit more and find out WHY they dont spell it out. Christianity is not just an American-based faith, but a global one. Im sure those reading my posts can draw the conclusion.

                             Sam, dont be so pompous. Stop preaching to someone who has lived a lot longer than you and knows where Jesus was born and who too. Blindly you think I am American, but once again you have slipped up. I am an English mature woman, who has lived long enough to know what is what. You should be proud you served in the Military, but it does not give you the right to think it makes you better than others. So being English, I tend to know that Christianity is not just American based. I Wish you A Merry Christmas, none the less.

                             stop typing G_D instead of God. Reluctance to spell G-O-D shows a certain lack of sincerity.

                             i think you are right.. the Rapture is coming so soon./ we are all goign to have to endure what is coming ahead but better for those who know Christ as their Lord &amp; savior than to not know Him.; If we put our faith in God he  will see us through no matter what travesty falls upon this land and it is coming. something that this country has never seen .. its just a matter of time folks Better be ready.

                             David, God gives us a brain to do his good works. When you stray from that path for whatever reason, be it greed or power. They will be punished somehow, not by God, but by their own inadequacy to live the Christian way. A so called Muslim religion, is just an excuse to kill non-believers and any one who get in the way of what they want. Killing is part of their nature, along with trechury, thievery and power to rule. Sadly looking at their countries, they will only ruin every country they take over.

                             A comment ONLY  a LIBTARD would make!  BHO is a Muslim, NOT a Christian and he wouldnt know the rule of law if one of his supposed law books hit him in the face! The ONLY thing hes been a great custodian of is his agendayou can read it in Rules for Radicals!  You might actually learn what this socialist is all about!  Wake up!

                             I think you had better rethink your arrogant, sanctimonious attitude.  You are about as unChristian as anyone Ive had the misfortune to run across.  Go find a funeral of the fallen you can protest with your evil buddies.

                             Shes the hater.  She can quote scripture all day but that doesnt make her or anyone else a true Christian.  A true Christian walks the walk, not talk the walk.  God expects us to be compassionate and accepting.  I believe He is a loving God who loves all of His children.  Obviously Virginia feels differently.  Shes more the hell, fire and damnation type of Christian.

                             Nineveh (now known as Mosul) was the only city spared by God in the days of biblical disobedience besides the flood due to repentance and prayer.  Monthly prayer groups on a national scale should be instituted to bring the fabric of America back to its sense of goodness.  Whats occurring now is constant sympathetic reactions to acts of violence
                             <br/>
                             around the world without a gyro stabilizing force to keep our balance.   Consistent monthly
                             <br/>
                             prayer on a national televised basis will reinstitute that stabilizing force.   Im an expert
                             <br/>
                             in history and this is another example of those who dont remember the past are doomed

                             to be treated like all those other cities and countries that were destroyed that didnt heed Ninevehs example.

                             dawn, no kidding God loves all His children.  But God is a just God and therefore will punish all unrighteousness.  Jesus said I have not come to save the world but to call people out of the world.  If you want to save the world go ahead.  Jesus spoke more about hell than any other subject.   So I guess you could say He was a hell fire and damnation Christ.  If you think there is no judgment, you are only fooling yourself.  Jesus is Lord.

                             dawn, how can you, a person who lives for the moment determine who is a Christian and who isnt?  In the time of Noah, the people were living for the moment, thats what eat, drink, and be merry is.  When the time of destruction came, they were unprepared.  So will you be if you keep living for the moment.  Jesus is Lord.

                             The End Time that is described in holy books does not mean the end of earth or end of human beings on earth. The meanings of End time are explained
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             As God has created seven days and likened each day to a thousand years, this metaphor shows, on the authority of the clear statement of the Holy Quran, that the age of the world is seven thousand years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Human civilization and dispensation have a cyclic life. The progeny of Adam also has a life cycle of seven thousand years. Only God knows how many Adams have passed away and how many have yet to come. From all this we may infer that this is the last age and the final era of the world, at the turn of which the Promised Messiah was destined to appear according to the Divine scriptures. (Lecture Sialkot)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             It is explained further: Another sign of the time of the Promised Messiah recorded in the Holy Quran is (Al-Hajj, 22:48): A day in the sight of God is like a thousand years according to your reckoning. Since the days are seven, we infer from this verse that this world is also meant to last seven thousand years, counting from the particular Adam whose descendants we are.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We learn from the Holy Quran that other worlds have existed before us, though we do not know what kind of people inhabited them. But it seems that an era of the world lasts for seven thousand years  as a symbol of which the days have been fixed at seven, each standing for a thousand years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We cannot say how many such cycles the world has gone through and how many Adams may have appeared in their own times, but it is certain that, since God is the Eternal Creator, the world must also be eternal as a species, though not in its forms and manifestations. Here, too, the Christians have erred, for they believe that God was eternally idle before He created heaven and earth some six thousand years ago.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             God has informed us that the present human race originated from Adam, our common ancestor who came after the previous races, and this human race has an age of seven thousand years, and that these seven thousand years are to God just as seven days are to man. It has been decreed by the Divine law that every race has a life span of seven thousand years, and it is to highlight this fact that the seven days have been ordained for man. Thus, the time ordained for the children of Adam is seven thousand years, five of which had already passed by the time of our Holy Prophetsa, as shown by the numerical value of the words of Surah Al-Asr.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             By now six thousand years of this era have gone and a thousand years remain. It has been prophesized, not only by the Holy Quran but by many earlier scriptures, that the last Messenger who will appear in the likeness of Adam, and will be named the Messiah, will appear at the end of the sixth millennium, just as Adam was born towards the end of the sixth day. All these signs should suffice for a man of understanding. (Lecture Lahore by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad 1835  1908)

                             I never said the end times in the Bible was the real end of the world, as in destruction of matter. However, matter can disappear. Decay of matter is a fact as well as prophecy. Jesus said: the earth will pass away, but my words certainly wont pass away Luke 21:33

                           Better look up-redemption is coming and you will notice an absence of all believers in GODS TRUTH! But that is not the end! You will still have a chance to repent though life will be incredibly horrible unless you take :THE MARK! But if you take the mark-eternity will be horrible beyond the imagination! GOD, THE CREATOR has been patient yet fair! If you like satanS DESTINY better-GOD allows you to join him in THE PIT!

                             I never said I didnt believe in God.  What I dont believe in are all of the doomsday sayer who are always predicting the end of the world.  It will come when God deems it the right time and only He knows when that time will be.  I have nothing to repent for.  I live a good Christian life, unlike some of the narrow minded bigots who call themselves Christians.

                             I dont have to prove that I am a Christian to you or to anyone else.  I believe in compassion and understanding, something I dont see a lot of here.  I certainly dont tell others what they have to do to please God.  Thats not my job; thats Gods job and He does it very well indeed.

                             Those who tell others what to do are usually those who need to look in the mirror themselves.  I would suggest you try it.  It sounds as though you need some real repenting.

                             listen to yourself, Dawn Harsleyyour comments do not make sense, youre just babbling to babbleyou need not tell me to go look in the mirror, Im well aware of my own shortcomings and I have faith that God is coming to settle things according to HIS LAW.

                             If you see yourself as a Christian, then should you not be giving testimony to the greatness and loving nature of God? Not to be condemning those that give Him the glory

                             dawn, if you think you have no need to repent, then you must feel you are God.  For God says that the heart of man is wicked ever, and that no man is righteous, no not one.  There fore we all have things to repent of.  Even John the Baptiste, Jesus, and Paul all said now is the time to repent, for the end is near.  When you die, it is the end of the world for you.
                             <br/>
                             All that remains is the final judgment of your life.  Jesus is Lord.

                             For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. That does not exempt you , me or anyone else. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. The word says we need to repent daily of our ways. I know i do. i am a sinner saved by grace. i know i screw up and i probably do daily. thats why we need Christ daily .. i pray daily that God will forgive me of my sins and mold me and make me like him.  the word says Be Ye Holy as i am Holy..

                         He is not the anti Christ. Anti Christ will be much more charming and much smarter and will turn into a raging horror movie character in time.

                           When you look at the Greek construction you see that their will be many anti christs but the anti christ will show up at a very specific time and refers to one person only. obama is an anti christ, not the anti christ.

                             He is definitely one that is closer to home. He is indeed the greatest danger to America than any other politician has been at any level. He does bow lower to satan than any other but if we have Christ then we will win at the end and that is what is most important. I have chosen to do everything I can to defeat his agenda because it is anti God, anti America, anti Constitution, anti Military and so forth. We need to do all we can to defeat evil, that is why I am so very much against him. In obamas case it is more than just a disagreement in policies, he is evil.

                             Typical left wing jackass. Anyone who disagrees with omuslim hates blacks in your incredibly simple mind. You could not be more mistaken.  I supported Herman Cain and I like everything I have heard Dr. Carson say so far, so pull your head out of your butt and try for once in your life to get the facts and the truth before you sound like a total 100% moron, because you have succeeded in doing that.  I will waste no more time with you, you are not worthy of it.

                             Keep your eyes on Soros who is part of the elite bunch who is running this fiasco.os just a pawn. If he thought of himself that way he wouldnt be such a narcissist, but hes so full of himself he actually thinks hes special. In the end result hell be gone, and hopefully his socialist, marxist regime. Go to Conservative Tribune there is a great article on how Thomas Jefferson handled the muslims I know very informative this isnt anything new just that we do not have a Pres. who took the Oath of office serious except to rob, and destroy OUR country.

                             Uzoozy  loves Christ? What a silly thing to say. He is clearly a lover of islam. Everything he does demonstrates his devotion to islam, to destroying America, to destroying Israel. Doesnt matter that hes C-in-C, he hates the military and us veterans. All he cares about is promoting homosexuality, abortion at any stage, and making America a Socialist country. God forbid!

                             Dude, drink more of your Obama mania Kool-Aid, dont bother to check out any of his actions that promote islam, denigrate Christ and Christianity and threaten Israel. Clearly, you fall into the liberal category of what Lenin called useful idiots.

                           Its possible the coming anti-Christ is what the muslims call the 12th imam. Hes the returning victor written about in the Koran. His description, there, and islam, in general give this possibility credence.

                             Maryann, Ive been saying the very same thing. It may well be. Given that there are over 1 billion muslims, in the world, the numbers written about in the apocalyptic verses could easily come from the muslim world.

                           the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
                           <br/>
                           depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

                       Yeah him and all his Muslim Brotherhood friends in key cabinet and judicial positions! Sooner or later (Ihope sooner) his real agenda will be found out and brought to light. Why do you think he made sure he got rid of most of the best of SEAL TEAMS they were just about the only ones who could take the White House and arrest the imposter , taken him and his prayer rug and kick them  to the curb.

                           Brietbart had the means to expose Barry Soetero or Hussein Obama or whatever he calls himself. His evidence was so good it cost him his life. Just like Fuddy and the plane crash in Hawaii. All them people on the plane and shes the only one to die, I call that more than a coincidence.

                             A barely known, not even a full first term Senator from Chicago, becomes President of the U.S.? Then reelected for a second term with at least 5 serious scandals that he was involved in directly? This has been a CIA backed, communist plot from the beginning! It all began with the death of Kennedy and the implementation of LBJ. Soros, Axelrod, Jarrett, Emmanual, Wright! Come on! They called him a community organizer? Yep, recruiting others into the communist party of America! This has been a planned plot for 60 years in the making! I will guarantee, if not removed from office now, we will have martial law before 2016 elections! Their sole intent is to destroy the United States of America!

                             Well so far his plan or whoevers plan it is. It is going off with just a couple minor glitches. You are right about martial law, only I figure about July or August 2015. The thing is Congress has enough on him to run him out of town, WHY DONT THEY ACT!

                             I just hope its not too late for the PATRIOTS of this country to stop whats going on in Washington. That town was named for an honest man, the father of our country they called him the whole time I was growing up. What happened? GREED THATS WHAT HAPPENED
                             <br/>
                             The days of honest men in government are slowly fading away. Guys like the Pauls, Rubio,Cruz. Come on guys figure something out huh! Find something in the LAW! DO IT FOR THE SALVATION OF THIS ONCE GREAT NATION. wE ARE A NATION OF LAWS-USE THEM!

                             tell them to have the Sgt. at Arms arrest him and then try him.  It
                             <br/>
                             would be the best way of getting rid of him, and they could include

                             Biden in that as well as an aider and abetter.

                             Obama was groomed for his job from a very early age.  Thats why his history is unknown  &amp; so many names, plus lies, lies, and more lies. Im sure their was a group that has given  $ for his education &amp; training.

                             0vomit is rapidly running out of time, and he has GOT TO find some way in which to stay in power.  So it would be a good guess that Martial Law would be his best piece of leverage.   I have suggested that we write to our Congressmen and tell them to have the Sgt. at Arms arrest him and then try him.  It would be the best way of getting rid of him, and they could include Biden in that as well as an aider and abetter.

                             Actually I am a fiscal conservative, a social moderate and a lifelong member of the Republican Party.  Of course, anyone who disagrees with you has to be a lib.  Three million of your fellow Tea Partiers and ultra conservatives stayed home from the polls in 2012 and we got another four years of Obama.  Happy now?  The Republican Party is imploding thanks to idiots like you.

                             You started it when you called me a lib.  You simply cant handle the truth and it will bite us in the ass in 2016.  Every Republican vote will be needed, along with some Independents if the GOP is to take the WH in 2016.  It isnt rocket science; its numbers.  The stark fact is that 3 million registered Republican non-voters helped keep Obama in the WH in 2012.  If there isnt a meeting of the minds soon, the GOP will continue to implode.  I wasnt thrilled with Romney either but after 4 years of Obama and the fact that he had nothing to lose during a second term, I voted for Romney.  Not everyone is going to like whoever the GOP nominee may be but the stakes are way too high to play games.  Lets agree on the issues that really matter such as illegal immigration, national security, jobs, ever increasing national debt.  Mike Huckabee, who I always respected, now says he will leave the Republican Party if they dont oppose same sex marriage.  We cant afford to dwell on these issues and forget those that matter most to America.

                             So is sex outside of marriage but I dont hear many people complaining about that.  4 out of 10 babies born in the US are born to single mothers.  In the black community, the number is 6 out of 10.  Where is the outrage over that?  Most of these children are destined for a life of poverty, many dont even know who their fathers are.  Which is the greater sin?  I would much rather see two people who love each other get married regardless of their sexual orientation than see the number of children born to single mothers.  The Bible does mention fornification, doesnt it?

                             I could cut unwanted prenancies in half. Just DNA the fathers and charge them 50,000 till the kids 18. No matter what check the fathers receive there will always be that deduction

                             Sounds like a plan although it is difficult to get checks from their drug customers.  Usually they pay in cash or shoot the dealer to get his stuff.

                             YES and that is why God is pouring his wrath on this country.. sin is sin and you can call it what ever you want but the truth is that it is an abomination unto God Almighty. Washington says its OK but what about when the law makers stand before the Lord of All. God says NO it is not OK.. they will give an account for what they have contributed to the demise of America.. laugh if you must.. this country once strong and the greatest nation on the face of the earth is now standing in Gods Judgement because of her sins..

                             I dont either approve or disapprove of homosexuals.  From everything Ive read, I dont consider it a lifestyle but simply a part of who these individuals are as a whole.  It isnt for me to approve or disapprove.  Do I believe that two people who love each other should be allowed to marry regardless of their sexual orientation?  Yes, I do.  As far as abortion is concerned, although I am philosophically opposed to abortion, unlike some, I dont profess to walk in these womens shoes.  I dont know what drives them to such a life changing decision.  I can only hope and pray that theyve thought long and hard, have gotten all the information they can gather and have prayed about it.  Frankly, it doesnt matter what we think.  The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is legal and all of the political rhetoric isnt going to change it.  The chances of any future Supreme Court rescinding a previous Courts ruling are slim to none.  In both cases, God is the ultimate judge, not we mere mortals.  Lets not think we can do His job better than He can.

                             the supreme court makes their rulings but the Supreme Lord of the universe who created Adam &amp; Eve says differently.. You can not argue with the word of God. You either believe all of it or none of it. you can believe in half the bible .. Its all or none.. i personally believe that the word of God is the inspired word from heaven above..

                             I dont want you to claim me.  Answer the question I posed above.  The Bible talks about homosexuals and it also talks against sex outside of marriage but I havent seen you mention that as being against Gods word.  Perhaps it hits a little too close to home.

                             Good for you.  My question is why all of the angst over same sex marriage when the Bible says sex outside of marriage is a sin and nobody seems to address it.  It seems nobody cares about the children that live in single parent homes, many destined to a life of poverty.  To me, that should certainly warrant some outrage also.  I guess people pick and choose what most meets their own agendas.

                             Sin cannot be stopped after it is started without the sinners repentance.  Fatherless children are a phenomenon not new to this world.  I spoke to my daughter extensively.  Her mother did, too.  She listened to her mother because she liked what her mother told her better.  My daughter and her fatherless children are paying the price for the acceptance of sin in our modern society.  Acceptance of perversion will work out to be more like a permanent problem for those who get addicted to homosexuality.  That said, Im glad my daughter didnt decide to undergo a procedure and kill my grandchildren.

                             I mention it quite a bit, Dawn.  Fornicators are in for the same judgment as homosexuals.  The difference in the sin from a social perspective is that homosexuality is a very difficult addiction to break.  Fornication is fixed with a commitment and a ring.  In other words, fornication isnt nearly permanent, homosexuality is.  Permanent sin is death.

                         Ive thought that too, Virginia.  I noticed the loss of Gods protection in the mid 1970s.  The truth is, that in order for Gods plan for the end of this age cant come about when the US is able to protect Israel from the whole world.  We NEEDED to be taken down in order for the whole world to come down on Jerusalem and frighten the jews into repentance.  Death awaits us all and is usually very unpleasant.  It wont really matter if we burn up in our homes, get cancer or get our heads chopped off by some crazed islamic satanist.  This country was built to be the greatest place on earth for us to live and it worked for a couple centuries.  In history, when God blessed the jews, they were on their way to depravity.  Human nature hasnt changed.  Weve done the same thing.  Never forget that we got the administrations that God wanted us to have (God lifts up who he will and tears down who he will).  Its his plan, his timing and other than through individual, personal repentance, we cant change his mind about what he will do.

                         i have to agree with that statement Virginia.. this is the  reason we got what we have. because of sin in America..this is our punishment.. think back when the Lord God gave Israel over to the Philistines . Because they had taken God out of their lives and so the Lord Gave them over to the enemy until they repented.. well see. same same here. we have been rewarded with a horrible leader as punishment for our sins.. think about this..  until the United States repents and puts God first  its going to get much worse. only when this country repents will God keep his back turned against this country. laugh if you will. its all biblical.. it is not going to get better.. No it wont get better until we fall on our faces and repent.. everyone..like Israel did and then God heard their pleas and healed their land and brought them back from catastrophic circumstances..

                       Actually, I think it started in 01, when despite intelligence warning Bush failed to prevent 9/11 and then let his Saudi pals off the hook and led us into a pointless war, to enrich Cheney and his cronies

                       Well the vast majority did not want Yehovah to rule over them, because they love the ways of sin. They didnt want Yahs commandments to be seen in public, and they dont want Him in the government, or in schools, or our military, so Yah left us to choose for our self a pagan ungodly ruler that would give us just what our majority wanted, the freedom to be totally immoral.  But sin brings bad consequences, that is what Yah was trying to help us to avoid.

                       Hos 5:14  For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, (thats us) And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them and go away; I will take them away, and no one shall rescue. 15  I will return again to My place Till they acknowledge their offense. Then they will seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me. Shalom!

                     The Question is not when or how soon? But by who?  Will it really be a terror attack by a terrorist group? Or will it be by this current government in order the they achieve to Control of our rights and freedom? Is this what  FEMA has been preparing for? Is this the opportunity Barrack Hussein has been looking for? Ladies and gentlemen, do not let a wool be placed over your eyes while There is something else going on.

                    <p>
                     Think about where this government has been taking us to since 2008. Think about the fact that no one dares to impeach BO. Think about the one world government that this administration along with the UN wants to implement. Why has he not been stopped for all the illegal directives, orders, violations. Think about how carelessly diseases have been allowed to roam our country with no real care of the catastrophic destruction of our Country and its citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There is something going very wrong here, and it will lead to total chaos and massive loss of innocent lives.. This is the plan of our own overgrown government that our forefathers warned us about. Only God and/or our Military leaders can save us know

                    <p>
                     You think this is nonsense, well I though the same about BOs reelection.

                         Im as conservative as they come. As for the FEMA Concentration/Camps, all you need to do is let your little fingers do some YouTube research and let your mind believe what your eyes see, and what many have been reporting. But be careful you dont mess up your manicure. Im not going to stand here and spoon feed you.

                             Let me help you out some, so that in the Future you will not look so foolish, and call a conservative a liberal. Read the very LAST sentence over a few times, eventually it will sink into your liberal mind.  The last sentence means I did not want BO to win, nor could I believe he won

                         Trust me when I say, that you do not have to try and convince me that the election was as fake as his Birth certificate. There are not enough stupid voters in America that would have voted for him a second time. Thus the reason why Illegals, cartoon characters, and the dead, had to be mobilized.

                       You are correct sir: Dont let some useful idiot like evowimaxuser make you think otherwise. How anyone can be so stupid they cannot see what this evil man and his evil minions are up to, even if it happens and Im sure it will, theyll believe any B.S story theyre told, because they will never accept that they were wrong.

                         The thing of it is if you happen to see something about to happen , and you intervene with violence and maybe even shoot a few opf the ragheads Obozo and Holder will try to prosecute you for oh I dont know violating their civil rights, or maybe even have them call you a racist. Seems like the going pattern so far . just sayin!

                     Who cares about another potential terror attack?  We give such an overwhelmingly lopsided response to their feeble attempts, the actual attacks are militarily stupid.  The problem is that they get press from even making threats.  How about we just ignore them and let the military do their job?  We can focus on improving schools and infrastructure; the rest will play out, and it wont be in the terrorists favor

                     I suspect a lot of things.but I know a lot of American people are mentally asleep when it comes to questioning this administration.  O is vaguely honest about his intentions, but most are unwillingtoo blind to see truth.  Our problem continues to grow with the indoctrination of our youth in our colleges and now even down to our elementary and kindergarten students because too many of their teachers swallowed the indoctrination and they are loyal to their unions.  Yes, I believe the fox is guarding the henhouseor opening its doors to the hoard of foxes. Those who love o wont even engage in debatethey learned well from Alinsky.  I am sure Our Founding Fathers laid a good foundation, but we have abandoned the founding principles they fought and died to give us because we are too lazy to know and understand them.   I agree that God and our military are our only hope.not sure if the military leadership has already been sucked into the vacuum.  I know also where my allegiance lieswith my Creator, Sustainer, Redeemer.   (Allah? NOT!)

                       Agreed. Obama fired a shipload of high ranking Generals, Admirals, and so forth. Soooo, what do you think theyre thinking right about now? They may well be the Organizers of our Countrys salvation.

                           I have as well. I have a feeling that some of these fired Officers have a contingency plan in case O goes completely over the rainbow. I will be proud to stand with them.

                     All Obama cares about is being politically correct..he may be endangering Americans by letting these illegals swarm into the country with their diseases and the terrorists accompanying them, he may be bombing empty buildings in the ME pretending its a war, and he may be allowing the TSA to permit illegals to fly without ID, and he may be afraid to call terrorism by name, but these shows hes putting on are only for his political benefit-or he wouldnt be doing it.  Hes going through a lot of money pretending to be doing something constructive.    This is all an act put on for our benefit like the democrats distancing themselves from his failing policies (just until the election is over)If all the rats have deserted the ship, why is Obama out fundraising to pay for their campaigns?   After the election, it will be corruption as usual.   As he said My policies are written on every ballot.its probably the first thing he ever said that was true.

                     These Warnings Are An  Deliberate Manipulation Tactic Used By The Obama Regime More Commonly Referred To As An False Flag In An Attempt To  Facilitate An Attempt An Further Consolidation Of Power And Control Over This Country and The People. There Are Too Many Inconsistencies  In Obama And Administrations General Dialog On This Matter That  Has Been  Thoroughly  Exposed As Untrue And Or Changed To Give These Warnings The Appearance Of  Accuracy And Legitimacy. I Would Not Trust Anything Coming From The White House Or Any Of  Its  Treasonous Accomplices In The Government.

                     The Borders Should Be Sufficiently Sealed And Secured And Every Prudent Step Taken To Protect And Defend The American People And This Country From Its Islamic And All Other Enemies Which Obama Has Been  Purposely Derelict In  Doing.

                     It was long after 9/11 was when we learned of heavy terrorist chatter, totally ignored by the FBI, CIA, &amp; any other security groupwhich tells us they had serious doubts and made no preparation.  I doubt Obamas goons will, either.

                     I think we have all know that we would be hit again as long as this idiot is in office because he worrys more about playing golf and worrys more about offending these Islamic barbaric animals than he does doing his job and protecting the American people. No we will be hit again and he will do nothing as always to try and stop it but will blame it on the republicans again as always.

                       Yes, of course, it will be George Bushs fault. Just like all of failures have been Bushs fault. And, sadly, democraps believe him. Whats worse is they keep voting long after they die.

                     Lets get this straight, America has many enemies! Not only from other countries, or organizations, heck some of our enemies (who want to do harm to this country and its citizens), reside right under our noses. Having leaky boarders makes us that much more vulnerable. The big question to me is, what, and if so, can we do about it? IMHO., the 2nd Amendment has more relevance now than it has in the history of our modern world. Especially with the threats we face in this day &amp; age. We have to ask ourselves, who would be the first on the scene, or be the first res-ponders if a terrorist sponsored attack were again to happen on our soil? I can tell you with certainty, it wont be the military, and it wont be law enforcement. Its us, thats why we have a 2nd Amendment!
                     <br/>
                     I can no longer point fingers &amp; play the blame game because the situation is what it is. The most frightening part of it is, its about to come knocking on our front doors. I take all of these threats seriously. Ive always been observant, but now, I find myself scrutinizing my surroundings even more! Living in So Cal &amp; being so close to breached boarders has put me on a high alert when out &amp; about with my wife &amp; children, and even at home. This is the reality we face right now no matter how this reality came to be. I can only suggest that we as citizens start in our homes, talk to our neighbors, formulate a plan with your neighbors &amp; friends what to do if something awful were to happen. I dont mean to sound pessimistic but, better to be prepared and have a plan than not be prepared and potentially end up being a victim.
                     <br/>
                     God Bless America!
                     <br/>
                     Lets hope and pray that we will once again come together with all our diversity as a nation and be proud to say,
                     <br/>

                     Are we not living in terror now.  A pos that will not close our borders,will not stop flights from Africa, encouraging civil disobedience, freeing terrorists, threatening amnesty, replacing our Generals with weaklings, pulling our national guard in 100 miles from the border. protecting IRS, and doing as much damage as he can.  Yes, we are definitely in attack from within.

                     We are seeing the beginning tribulation prophesys of Dan chapters 7 &amp; 11, and Rev 13, &amp; 14 taking place, which the flyaway Church preachers said we would not be here for.  But just as the Scriptures say, Yehoshua followers will either accept the antichrist Beast religion of Islam, or get beheaded.  When you see Turkey, ISIS, and Persia allied as one conquering Egypt, then all hell is about to brake loose on earth.  Shabbat Shalom!

                     The terrorist is in the White House. Why doesnt Fox News know this? Gwenrth Paltrow is about the lowest human in America. We must boycott everything about her. All films and books and anything we can possibly boycottThe news says she is one of the dumbest stars in Hollywood and not even pretty.She needs to be arrested with Obama for wanting him to bring all his plans into existence and opening her home to collect the money for him to do it and for fawning over him like a silly school girlShe was totally pampered and spoiled in her home by her Hollywood parents. Why did they not teach her anything at all?

                     The Treasonist is still in the WH today!  Thats whats wrong with our country today?  Time for him to be impeached  and tried for Treason.  Vote for Conservative Tea Party Republican in 2014 so we can take back the Senate and Fire Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader!  Maybe then we can get Obama impeached and tried criminally.

                     So, this is telling me that a terrorist attack is imminent although the place, time, and method is unknown! Well, it is pretty much the same as these end of the world soap box preachers predicting doom and gloom. Why would someone with the responsibility of being the Dir of the FBI be so irresponsible? This guy has the tools of the most intelligent network of information at his disposal I would think that his mission would be to (within the dept) determine the most logical places and times, and work to thwart the attack and protect Americans and property  not cry Wolf! which only creates stress for us. WTF is going on with these guys? I question whether these appointees are even marginally qualified to do their jobs (in many instances).

                     When you open the southern border to pad the voter rolls with illegals  you are trading security for (DNC) votes. When (not if) we get hit, it will almost certainly be by a group who waltzed across our unmanned southern border with the weapons they will use to kill Americans.

                    <p>
                     Obama and his lackeys will attempt to deflect blame. BUT, in reality, the attack will come from an extension of al Qaeda  yeah, the group that Obama killed  OR from ISIS, who the Obama administration armed and then later referred to as the incapable JV team of terrorists. Under Obama, we have NO Homeland Security and, the FBI says that were going to pay the price for it  soon.

                     Vote these traitorous DNC clowns OUT, in November.

                     No the terror attack began long before thatyears and years before. They have been planning at least since the 70s and placing Muslims in various places for the time to come, which seems to be now.

                     Barrack Hussein Obama (POTUS) does not stand for any intrinsic values that America was founded. Obama is only going through extrinsic motions of trying to be POTUS. His agenda is esoteric (that is, ideas preserved or understood by a small group of those specially initiated minions (slavish follower of somebody generally regarded as important) of unusual interest  and divisive in plan..he has partially succeeded..but it will not continue on.

                     History of the FBI has shown that if a threat does not exist the FBI will create a situation whereby it will happen.  The I told you so.  Too many times the FBI has been responsible for creating the situation to prove their point, but also to ensure Congress will increase their budget and allow for greater personal and bureaucratic rewards.  Expect it to center around the time of the election!

I can only blame those that voted for him the second time. I dint hate them, I just blame them for voting for the color of his skin and not his performance or integrity.

                     Korosan Group now?  Not ISIS or ISIL?  Not even Muslim Brotherhood which has richly infiltrated our government under 0vomit?  Not Hezbollah or Hamas?  He brought 80,000 Hamas over here as refugees, along with all their families in 2010.  He got a $20,000,000 grant immediately after taking office the first time to pull that one off.  As far as I see it, Muslim is Muslim and Muslims have yet to play Cowboys and Muslims.  Now for the cowboys out there, make sure your ammo is dipped in pigs blood or bacon fat  not much, just a drop or two works fine.  You can even purchase gun cleaner with pig fat in it if you prefer.  Muzzies (ALL of them) are petrified of anything associated with pig because they cant go to heaven and they cant receive their 72 virgin (goats) with pig-anything on them!

                     I dont think that Obama wants victory for America. He is actually trying to bring us down to the level of  a third World Country, or lower. He hates Americas  standing in the world, and he hates America, just as his father did who taught Barrack to hate Americaand he learned the lesson well. About two years ago I had a debate with a man who said Obama is making mistakes, It seems so much of what he does is a mistake. I told him that Obama is not making mistakes, and that just about everything he does is deliberately doing what will harm us!  I pray for the Lord to come back and straighten us out. Only God can solve this mess!

                     Khorasan Group
                     <br/>
                     What they are is a new way to name ISIS, ISIS is what was created by us to defeat Pres. Assad of Syria.
                     <br/>
                     Dont be fooled by Mr. Obola as he has proven to be a magician.
                     <br/>
                     If you cant beat ISIS then rename it to (as Rush says) to the Khorasan Group. Now we have what we were told is a new meaner group.
                     <br/>
                     We could not call them what they really just might be..
                     <br/>
                     al Queda (or hatever) that group was, cause mr. Obola said he beat them already.
                     <br/>
                     He came to office and a few months later declared they had been (magically) defeated!
                     <br/>
                     So what or who are we going to fight next and where?
                     <br/>
                     Remember we cant fight them in Iraq cause Mr. Obola already took his victory lap for that victory(?) now can we?
                     <br/>
                     He could say they moved to Afghanistan because he is just winding up that victory lap. Maybe the will cooperate and stay in Syria and Russia will let him finally bomb and fight there. but he already said no boots on the ground there.
                     <br/>
                     What is there to do Mr. Obola?  Maybe he can get them to move over to Israel, and then he could let Samantha Power stop by and bomb them on the way home from Liberia!!
                     <br/>
                     So he gives Samantha the bombing of that apartheid regime (close to her words back in 2008) and they can claim he won two more wars!
                     <br/>
                     If you have the right help, sooner or later everyone can get what they want.
                     <br/>
                     What to do about Hilary though? Didnt you promise her something too?
                     <br/>
                     Oh well, cant please them all.. and we are just getting to intramural hoops time, and Ebola has just been declared defeated. chalk another one up to unlucky timing?
                     <br/>
                     And just when things were getting interesting.
                     <br/>
                     But that is what he has Mr. Klain for so all is good
                     <br/>
                     Move along, nothing to see here! The doctor is not in the house
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But was there anything real anywhere since you were coronation.. err inauguration mr. obola.
                     <br/>
                     We are so lucky we have a COMMUNITY ORGANIZER and not just a plain old president.

                     Just a thought.IF another terrorist/Islamic (thats RIGHT Islamic) major attack (like 9-11) happens in OUR USA, its ALL out WAR on themeven if they are in a political office.whoever them are.get it!  Also, no BS fooling around with our boots on the ground.we send over a FAT BOY.like President Truman did in 1945.

                     We are being invaded daily, with the full approval of the oval office idiot. There will be no shortage of personnel available for an attack! The single member attacks that are labeled work place violence are doing what they want!! If we wont close the border we are issuing open invitations for these attacks. Get busy contacting your representatives. If you dont tell them what you want they have no way of knowing.

                     Chatter? The terrorists are into out and out dialogue. Its the present administratiion thats chattering a day late and a dollar short, I take that last part back, they are never short of money for nonsensical agendas,.As long as the admin keeps announcing our attacks the terrorists can hide and the Prez has asked for 35 million visas. Could it be for the Islamists being driven out of the european nations by the thousands of protesters..Frankly this present administration looks like the true terrorists in this country and the PEOPLE are afraid of it. But, according to Pelosi we are insignificant..As for her comments on the Good Samaritan story, she obviously doesnt know her bible or the history of that time frame. I would like to mention to her that the samaritans were shunned and while he did get lodging,food and medical care for the victim, HE LEFT THE VICTIM IN HIS HOMETOWN AND DIDNT TAKE HIM  ALONG ON HIS JOURNEY AND HE DIDNT take him to his personal home. So much for bringing ebola or illegals into OUR home.

                     Khorasan (rising in the sun and about to come)  =  al-Qaeda.  Khorasan is territory that lies mostly in modern-day Afghanistan, Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan!!!!  Of course, Obama is a Sunni Muslim from Kenya, and Jarrett is an Irani, so between the two of them they certainly know the significance of that region.  In my brief google search, the name of the group was COINED BY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES as a reference to the high-ranking al-Qaeda members.  Please know that it has been told (though I cannot document) that OBAMA didnt want U.S. citizens to think al-Qaeda is alive and well because he so proudly boasted after HE KILLED Osama Bin Laden, and that al-Qaeda was no longer a threat to the U.S.  Hence, Obama and his administration came up with the name Khorasan, as if it was a brand new fighting force and threat to the U.S. entering the picture!!!!

                     i wouldnt doubt it, but keep in mind with the republicans retaking the senate tomorrow (hopefully by nine seats) we will have people in the house and senate who know how to deal with terrorists.  Unlike the obama clan who wants to limit their presence through twitter, facebook and selective strikes (LOL).  BTW Obama is a muslim, and he wants an attack on our country just as he puts our military troops in a place where they can get some diseasewhy doesnt he go over there and help the n*ggers if he wants to take care of ebola patients.

                     is very likely.  By the way maybe the cruise ship that hit an unknown object on Friday really hit a Russian submarine.  Why they havent say what kind of object it hit?

                     The final answer is, per the story above, VOTE, REMOVE THESE MORONS OUT OF POWER AND REPLACE THEM ALL WITH AMERICIANS WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY.  No more socialists-communists in our government.  Arrest them, try them and punish them, all!

                     Something that just amazes me is how the voting system is with illegal aliens voting. No ID at all is the biggest scam going and it is a fixed election. What is more amazing is how ignorant a lot of these legal citizens really are. They vote and have not a clue who is the president now never mind knowing the communist ways that are overtaking the country. The GOP has nothing to offer other than vote for me cause I disagree with the dems. Now that makes a lot of sense, no nothing to offer but just get a big check to sit there and agree with the dems.
                     <br/>
                     Nothing but a scam for both parties.

                     Heb13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.  (Yehovahs grace does not change His judgments pertaining to moral righteousness, Mat 5:17-18,1Co 6:9-10).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Lev 26:14  But if you do not obey Me, and do not observe all these commandments, 15  and if you despise My statutes, or if your soul abhors My judgments, so that you do not perform all My commandments, but break My covenant, 16 I also will do this to you: I will even appoint terror over you, wasting disease and fever which shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 17  I will set My
                     <br/>
                     face against you, and you shall be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you shall reign over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you. 18  And after all this, if you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your
                     <br/>
                     sins. 19  I will break the pride of your power; I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze. 20  And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land
                     <br/>
                     shall not yield its produce, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. 21  Then, if you walk contrary to Me, and are not willing to obey Me, I will bring on you seven times more plagues, according to your sins.
                     <br/>
                     Unless we as a Nation repent and turn back to Yehovah, Yah will vomit us out, and we will cease to be a sovereign Nation.  (Lev 18:22-28).  Shalom!

                     This is another ploy of Obamas and I personally believe that his agenda all along is to turn this country into a nation of sharia law with him as the head honcho. I felt a momentary hope rise up on the republican victories but it deflated the last couple of minutes in McConnells victory speech and he stated the congress would compromise with Obama. The same implication that Pelosi made calling various people insignificant. applies to

                     <br/>
                     not take over if you have your guns and ammo.
                     <br/>
                     The Government has labeled all ex-military terrorists
                     <br/>
                     because they usually have guns and know how to use
                     <br/>
                     them. The Government is looking to take your guns
                     <br/>
                     away. They need to start with Senator Diane Finestein.

                     How is it Obama got elected when most people know he has a brother in the Muslim Brotherhood by the name of Malik. This in itself should have got him disqualified from a run at presidency what happened here??? Hes muslim when he said he was christian, hes a homosexual, those children arent his. The man has more than 1 SSI card that arent his. Isnt this in itself a criminal offence punishable by a jail term. Still hes out there gearing up for the colapse of the USA?? Yeah Americans are dumber than sheit. You people have seen Chuck Norris movie Invasion USA??? Guess what border they will be coming from. Yes Americans are stupid why hasnt our borders been secured. We have to vote in bull sheit like this ???   This in itself stinks like treason folks.

                     We all know its no longer a question of if but a question of WHEN.  It would not surprise me our current regime could be proven to somehow facilitate the occurence. The current regime won by election fraud back in 2008 in the same way Clinton did for his re-election.  Congress and law enforcement needs to draw up the proper charges and start making some arrests.

                       it amazed me how the media made it a joke if you believed or questioned the birth certificate and Obamas birth location.  but an actual certificate without discrepancies was never presented.  one of the birth certificates as a matter of fact was proven to be false.  who has to create their own birth certificate?

                     hink of this boys and girls. ISIS, Khorosan Group, whatever, they all have the same enemy, the USA. They have infiltrated our country with people from open borders and their doctrines have influenced even home born citizens who have an axe to grind with other people in the US, because they are perpetual LOSERS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     As a theory, ISIS, Khorosan Group, They will try to pull off what the VC did in the Vietnam war did right here in our own cities and larger Towns.Just like In Vietnam.. It was called the TET Offensive. They used it to create maximum consternation, a shock and awe affect. In the end the US forces defeated them. But unfortunately the US never defeated the VC and the NVA because in typical democrat form, instead of going in full bore like most of generals on the JCS wanted for years, Johnson just made a limited war with limited objectives in the end just kicking the hornets nest in a limited way. After Tet our forces destroyed them, even the B-52 raids in Khe Sanh we had em crushed.. If wus Johnson had the balls to then allow the Generals to into Laos and Cambodia like they were screaming since 1966, they could have destroyed the NVA and the VC once and for Good. The US could have walked away with a victory. Instead bringing a democrat Johnson was severely and emotionally affected by it along with the minority hippies protesting it (who are now our democrat lawyer politicians) to sway the media. Johnson never wanted Vietnam but his Great society program which crashed and burned where we are now paying for it. So he folded after Tet.  in the end we got stung and the American GI got the shaft.

                     Today we have another democrat idiot Obama with no balls. A Tet like event in our country would overwhelm law enforcement. Most of the majority of them are p_ssies and would fold like a chair and would have no clue what to do in real combat. It would be left to those who are armed. Civilians alongside of portion of law enforcement who have balls to kill these infiltrators.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     A Tet like event in most major towns in the US where Shopping Malls, sports events, crowded transportation routes would all be attacked. How could law enforcement deal with it? Even if the military would be called to defeat them the military complex is too large and not fast enough to engage. Once engaged though, these infiltrators would then defeated but not after a lot of American civilians would be killed in the thousands. Then maybe that would be enough to have American support behind a war effort to go over and finally settle an old score with these Muslims that have dogged civilization since the time of Thomas Jefferson who also struggled with these animals that created the Marine Corp..I sure hope I am wrong

                     The areas hardest hit would be in those states with the strictest gun controls where easy targets would present themselves. In places where guns are carried freely they know it would be tougher.People better wake up.

                       Americans become sick of war very quickly.  they want in today and see the need but tomorrow when the dirty stuff starts they want to quit. America is not street fighters.  When the nose gets busted and the blood starts flowing people want to quit but a street fighter is just getting started.  show them some blood and some pain and they are ready to go harder.  when bush stood on the rubble in new York and said we will get the people responsible for this people cheered.  Calendars hung in offices with the World Trade Centers on them and the words, never forget.  America forgot and forgot rapidly as usual. I wasnt in Nam but often have read we were actually fighting the Chinese and Chinese weapons is that true.  If we would have pressed, like all knows we could have done, would we have ran into the Chinese?  I have always thought we may have been inches from the big war right there.

                     if there is an attack excuse me when there is an attack on American soil this person in the White House will tell us that we should be sympathetic to those that attacked us that it is our fault that they attacked us. I believe any attack that happens here in the United States will be UN backed. everyone needs to look up Agenda 21 this is the plan the UN has to take over the world and this is what Obama and the socialist Democrats are trying to help them do. I have said this before if the UN is not trying to take over the United States why do we have so many UN soldiers in the United States now and why do we have all of the FEMA camps set up all across the country. I believe Obama and his side of the government will not give up power without a fight that is why they are buying up so much ammo

                     A cynical critic could claim (and they have) that this is a diversion. With the mid-terms approaching, this president wants a public focused on fear. But those claims ring hollow with this administration..

                     What really does ring hollow is the last sentence of the part of this article I quoted above. During the coming election, Obama most certainly does want the voting American people to be distracted and thinking about anything but the important issuessuch as his endless lies, his endless acts of betrayal of the American people, his continued refusal to enforce our laws, secure our borders, or follow our Constitution, his outrageous tyrannical, socialistic, pro-Islamic, anti-American behavior, his endless efforts to destroy our country, and the numerous acts of treason which he has committed and continues to commit.

                     We will have to put up with terrorists untill we stop sticking our nose in other countries business.  We have to pull all our troops out of the middle east and stay out of there and let them solve their own problems.  We have enough problems here at home.  We cant be the police force of the world anymore.

                     I dont understand why people dont realise that there will be an attack. No ifs or buts, they will attack you in the coming future. That is there whole aim of coming to your country. To take over, get rid of Americans and make the country a big shit tip like the one they have left. Dont be mistaken, they will attack you at some point.

                     And what has the FBI done about the 35 terrorist training camps they have identified in America? And yet they warn us about something coming, a terrorist attack. Even worse, these people openly preach the overthrow of our government.

                     Keep the borders wide open as they have been, and for sure there will be terrorist attacks.  Ill never understand why Washington continues to allow our borders to remain wide open.  Heres what we face:  Terrorists, power grid destruction, illegal drugs, Criminal gangs[MS13],  unchecked diseases like tuberculosis. dengue fever, chicken pox, scabies, strains of influenza not heard of in this country, and Im sure Ive left out others.  And we have 2 more years of this complete nut case?  Wonderful.

                     If this is true, theyd better ask Obama if they can use any anti-terrorism action.

                     Its usually someone who is above the noise of the common croud that backs facism. and communism. If they started out in the trenches they wouldnt be spouting this retoric. Why do you think we have some 15 million beating on our border to knock it down. Oh Ive got the numbers right dont worry it will more than likely be more.

                     I once had a friend who got these vegatable seeds 5cents a pak. I was part of 3 young men living in this on house rental. He started the garden not knowing how we took over. Next thing I know is he is no longer taking care of the garden just trading and giving away what we worked for.

                     The terrorist attack on the USA constitution and Bill of Rights has been coming from the White House along with the brotherhood and the In-Justice Dept. Congress needs to remove and arrest the President and his cohort from the In-Justice Dept. We the People are angry that all we get from the White House is lies and no enforcement of the Federal Immigration laws. WE are not going to CHANGE the USA Federal Immigration Laws for the Illegal Aliens which are criminals and should be arrested and sent back to their home country. Congress better step in and remove the President and the A.G.;. Because, the Federal Immigration laws are not being enforced by the Justice Dept that Obama over sees.

                     I absolutely and unequivocally agree with conservative senior as I am also one and a disabled Vietnam vet. This sorry excuse for a sitting president has been a national disgrace since his initial election, if you can legitimately call it so but, since no one will investigate that in SPITE of all the STILL unanswered questions of his basic eligibility to hold the office, among other things ; including the wearying and constant scandals and obfuscation of Justice by Attorney General Eric Holder. The man was NEVER fit to be elected, is a total incompetent, violates the oath of office nearly every day, rules in contravention of Constitutional law and gets away with it because of the gutless wonders in a criminally complicit Congress which ENABLES him to do whatever he feels like doing! It is legally and morally WRONG and he needs to be held both responsible and accountable for his actions but; congress is cowardly, and incapable of doing their duty and living up to their obligation to act as a check and balance on the power of the Executive Branch; one of the major Raison Detre for their very EXISTENCE when their  responsibilities were assigned by the Founding Fathers!

                     Over one hundred supposed terrorist attacks by the FBI. 97 were FBI false flags and 3 were interrupted by passerbys. The FBI has lost its narrative and they should be more careful making statements like this.

                     A secret, unknown, unheard of multi-national group, from unknown  countries somewhere on our planet is planning a secret terrorist mission in a country somewhere in the world where a lot of white people live, very, very soon!!
                     <br/>
                     Be afraid, very, very  afraid !  Why wasnt our intelligence (sic) this accurate (sic) prior to 9/11?  In the Atlanta GA International airport, the intercom constantly bleats Warning, Warning, we are under a yellow alert.  Report any suspicious activity. Watch your bags. Do not leave your bags unattended. Warning, Warning!
                     <br/>
                     In the Charles De Galle AP, Paris,  Beautiful music is played over the intercom. People walk without fear, casually sit in restaurants and bars and talk.  Groups of soldiers (3 each) walk casually on patrol throughout the airport, full uniform carrying machine guns.  The music is nice, no fear.  America and Americans have been over run without a shot being fired.  The  country, the people and the minds of the people have been captured and the indoctrination of the new ruling regime continues, unabated.  Wake up America  all that is taking place in America is being initiated and propagated by the present Nazi regime  no one else. How do we know a terrorist attack will take place?  Because they are the ones initiating the attack  they should know when- if they know why isnt it being stopped?
                     <br/>
                     Ref: 9/11  All Air Force/ military defense aircraft stand-down , do not launch defensive sortie, repeat, do not launch defense against  commercial aircraft

                     (Q) Why does one have to suffer.
                     <br/>
                     (A) 1 Peter 5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Suffering causes the unsaved to call out to God (some in cursing and others in desperation); the heart is exceedingly evil, so harden not your heart and accept the free love gift of God the Father in Jesus Christ, His Son  and soon coming King.

                     Let it be known to everyone you know that they should spread the word that if their ammo is tipped with bacon grease, the Muzzies will be frightened to death because if they have anything remotely associated with pigs in or on them, they cannot see allah, and they cannot receive their 72 virgins.  Check out what Gen. Pershing did to the Muzzies in the Philippines that quelled them for 50 yrs.  Just do a search for Gen. (Black Jack) Pershing in the Philippines.  VERY interesting and true story.  It definitely DOES work!!!
                     <br/>
                     Here is another incident you may remember when some Muzzies purchased some land in TX to build a mosque.  After they bought it they found out that their neighbor owned a pig farm.  They tried to make him leave, but he had been there for years, so rather than leave, the farmer began having pig races on Friday nights (that coincidentally is their prayer night), and the muzzies MOVED!!!  You can look all this up online so you will know its true.  Dont let them scare you!

Look..the man has been on a destruct the USA  warpath ever since before he was elected. Hes always been up to no good and I would bet money on the fact that he is a Muslim in the Isis group.

                     If we as a nation do not awaken to the fact that we need to REMOVE all islamist muslims from our country, we will fight them here on our own shores! This is inevitable and with no way around it! Of course there will be those that throw the Japanese in our face. So be it, but at the time it was what we as a nation had to do! The only problem is that we need to REMOVE  these islamist muslim individuals! Sending them back to their own country!

                     If we do not do this, then we will fight them right here on our own soil! Thats a fact!

                     We regressed, as a Country under Carter, Came back under Reagan and OL` Wiily Weanie Clinton pushed us further into Corrupt Government.  Made progress toward getting  back to under George Bush, but He was somewhat too lax in improving our Military and his Son really wasn`t forceful enough in improving our Military. This Charlie McCarty is having his his strings pulled by someone other than, just his Wife, but I`d bet SHE does get on his rear end to pull some of this stupid and unconionable acts, like open borders, and inciting our local terrorist organizations that take every opprtunity to incite riots and shake down and create burnings, ruining of communities. It`s there in front of all to figure out. Just think people!

                     It is truly amazing how we allow the law to control even the law enforcers- if they know the terrorist, and they must with all the info they supposedly have- then take them out on a potential threat to national security. If grand-ma has her cane and underwear searched in order to get on a plane, why cant the terrorist be held pending an investigation  or as the Patriot Act provides, you know, the law that was written prior to 9/11, hold them indefinitely, without a lawyer, charges or anything else? It is done to innocent people all the time-
                     <br/>
                     OBAMA -WHAT IS HE DOING   Over the weekend, the USAFs largest cargo plane set down in Kiev, Ukraine (UKE) What was the cargo- EU did not reveal that- but it was not humanitarian aid, bet you socks on that! The US, Obama White House has promised Poland and Romania he would have 7,000 missiles within their borders NLT the end of 2015. Kiev, the NAZI government that Bidden, McCain, Kerry and Obama have set in- is being supplied with Tanks, rockets, plastique and  gas, plus millions of rounds of NATO. 7.62 hollow point ammo- all for use against the civilian population. Do NOT  accept the government line that Russia has invaded Ukraine. All that has been publicized about Russia and UKE is total propaganda, nothing more.  There are no Russian forces in UKE  not a single jeep, tank or soldier. The war is between the Kiev- Obama government and the anti-Nazi civilians. But it isnt even the anti-Nazis being killed- it is all civilians- using American weapons etc.
                     <br/>
                     Not a single Russian soldier has been killed in UKE  not a single tank lost   no Russian prisoners taken- no Russian vs UKE  battles  absolutely nothing has been done by Russia.  Wag the dog ?  No, worse !  A total fabrication on the Nazi President and the Obama WH !
                     <br/>
                     All has been done to justify a war against Russia-  Even NATO and the EU has been lied to by the OWH !   Countries that refuse to sanction Russia are being bullied by the OWH, even with threats of military force- The screw is turning- the USA has become the Hitler of WWII-  Europe, Asia, and Africa are turning against the USA because of the Obama lies and threats from the WH.  Wake up folks, the world is becoming a powder keg, and Obama has the match  it is his plan and purpose- destroy the world- turn it over to the insane and evil- the Islamic Terrorist

                       You are completely WRONG about Ukraine. In fact youre delusional. I talk to my family over there every week to get a glimpse &amp; the truth as to whats going on over there. These are feet on the ground reports from UK citizens, no media BS. Make no mistake Putin wants Ukraine under Soviet rule. Fabricated propaganda???? Fake??? Wag The Dog???? Granted, I too dislike Obamas foreign no policy, but, Putin is in Ukraine because Obama is a flaccid little worm when it comes to standing up to him. Obama is impotent. You need to get back to reality Ron.

                         I normally do not get personal, but since you felt it necessary, I will accommodate you  I am married to a Russian Lady, we have children and grand-children in Odessa, and friends in Topsey (sic) and Crimera (Crime). I also have on the ground witnesses. Neighbors in Odessa also claim Putin is the cause for all the problems- propaganda provided by local UKE controlled TV and radio. I am also ex-military, intelligence officer. You, Bubba, are either a Ukrainian or an Idiot, did I repeat myself? I will not belabor the point with my opinion against your on the ground reports- just please, for my sake and the sake of the entire world- answer these simple questions: How many Russians have been killed in Ukraine? How many POWs have been take by either side? How many Russian tanks have been destroyed in Ukraine?  On the other hand, how many metric tons of humanitarian aid, in the form of medical supplies, baby formula, food and clean water has Russia trucked into UKE?  How many refugees have fled UKE into the evil Russia? (Over a million government documented people have fled into Russia, where they have been provided food, houses or apartments, clothing, bedding, toys, computers and even    are you ready Mr. Know it all   JOBS ! )
                         <br/>
                         Get your shat right- or stand down  What is Joe Biddens itinerary- how many times has he been in Kiev over the past nine months? Where does his son work in UKE? Where does John Kerrys son work in UKE? Where is the property John McCain owns in UKE located?  Who is mining the only natural resource in UKE? An American owned firm !!!
                         <br/>
                         Get the facts straight- make a trip to Ukraine, good Buddy- verify what you think you know- give me proof- give the world proof- open the great lie for all to see big boy!!!!

                           You support Putin, Youre a communist. Ex militaryLOL who gives a crap. Maybe ex KGB by your support of Putin &amp; his communist agenda driven occupiers.
                           <br/>
                           I truly feel sad for your family in Odessa, and hope no harm come to them. War, no matter what side people take, is always dreadful. The fight for freedom has its casualties and its price You support Putin &amp; the likes of Victor Yanukovych (remember, the corrupt prick they kicked out), I dont. You believe Ukrainians fighting for their freedom from Communism &amp; Putin, are on the wrong side. I dont. I support freedom &amp; their fight. The majority of Ukrainians want the same kind of freedom we take for granted here in the USA. Believe what you want, support who you want. I dont support Communism and never will.

                             I do not support anyone. Maybe you cannot read, maybe you cannot understand what you read- but you do have a problem- All I gave you are the facts- but cant, or do not want to believe that. The method of operations are the same for morons like yourself- if you cant argue the facts, call names, then put in a mold so you can identify and curse what you have identified. I am for freedom, that is the reason I waste my time addressing idiots like yourself.  The people of Ukraine are not fighting Putin- they are fighting the UKE Army- wake up- tell your relatives to wake the f up!  Give me the  proof  answer the questions  you cant because they will prove me correct-  give me your proof  show me what  Putin has done and is doing-  you cant  all you can do is call names and attempt to belittle. I have spent many years training and learning- I know my job  I pay attention  where is your proof  any evidence will do- send it to me- or shut the hell up and stop spreading the propaganda you have suckled on all your life- you did vote for Obama, didnt you? !! On second thought, make the trip  to Kiev, take a bus down the east border- photo the cities the UKE army has destroyed in order to cleanse the country; take photos of the NAZI armbands worn by the army and many citizens of Kiev; stop in at the barracks in Kiev and talk with the 150+ US advisors stationed there; Look up the senior person with Greystone, the spin off from Blackwater, the mercenaries from Iraq and Syria; give them a big hug, tell them how much you are supporting them and their humanitarian efforts in a country where genocide is taking place; take a lot of photos- the villages that have been leveled by bulldozers- the burnt out villages, where nothing lives; BUT please take photos of all the Russians you can find in the country of Ukraine, because for each accurate photo showing a Russian tank, with Russian markings and Russian soldiers, I will send you one thousand US$!!
                             <br/>
                             Have a good trip  stay and fight for freedom, kill as many non-Ukrainian  advisors as possible.   Again, show me Biddens itinerary for the month of May 214 through the present month- it is public record hot shot- send it to me

You have lies &amp; communist propaganda, thats all you have. You &amp; Obama went to the same Liberal Lying school.  When it comes to the Stalin/Lenin type Commies like yourself, you stop at nothing to further your Commie/Socialist cause.  Go for it foolish man. Im not lapping at the commie Koolaid fountain like you. I bet you believe Americans didnt land on the moon. Or better yet, 9/11 was a conspiracy by the Bush administration. Im sure you have proof &amp; pictures of Big Foot too.lol You Libs take the cake!!!!!

                     If Obama were a Republican, hed already be impeached &amp; in jail!  Unfortunately, our lame stream media have controlled what most Americans see on the news.  They simply have NO CLUE!  If they did, Obama probably wouldnt have been re-electedbut then, Soros controls the elections.  Any way you look at this awful situation, our country is in deep do-do!  The rest of us who get their news on FOX, OAN, from Rush or Sean, have known exactly whats been happening from the get-go! But, were totally helpless to do anything about it!  So frustrating!

                     There is however a way around these muzzie encroachers.  Pigs!  Pit fat, bacon grease, pigsblood  however and whatever way you want to use it!  Tip your ammo with it, clean your gun with cleaner that contains it (it is on the market).  These tough guys become sniveling sissies where pig anything is concerned.  They cannot go to heaven and they cannot get their 72 virgins.  What a shame huh?  But its guaranteed it works.  Check out what Gen. Pershing did in the Philippines that quelled them for 50 yrs.  We have the same and probably even better resources!
