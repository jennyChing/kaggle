    Translator's Introduction
   </h3>
   <p class="justify">
    Plutarch was born at Chaeroneia, a small town on the northern confines of Boeotia, about the middle of the first century of our era, and toward the close of the reign of the emperor Claudius. He belonged to a family of ample means and generous culture, and was liberally educated. He studied at Athens, the most attractive university town in his day for both Greeks and Romans, and was a disciple of Ammonius of Lamptrae, a Peripatetic philosopher deeply versed in religious lore. Returning to his native town, he was soon called upon to represent it as deputy to the Roman governor of the province of Greece. That he travelled extensively over Greece, visited Asia Minor, Egypt, and Italy, and resided much at Rome, may be inferred from his writings, as most that is known about him must be inferred. At Rome, he was in charge of certain public business, so that he had not time to learn thoroughly the Latin language, as he himself confesses in the introduction to the
    <i>
     Demosthenes.
    </i>
    But Greek was the language of literary and polite
    <a id="pxii">
    </a>
    <span class="noindex pagenum">
     p.xii
    </span>
    society at Rome, and cultivated Greeks, especially philosophers, were welcome there. As a Greek philosopher, and a populariser of Platonism, Plutarch read and lectured at Rome, much as he did in the small but select circle of his intimates and friends at home. He made and retained a large acquaintance with the prominent Romans of his day, and was familiar with the questions which most occupied the minds of men at the political centre of the world. Then, after Athenian education, generous travels, diplomatic missions, modest literary celebrity, and considerable residence at Rome, he seems to have retired to his little country home, with his books, notes, lectures, essays, and gentle philosophy, and there, in a leisure not all too much encroached upon by local magistracies and certain religious offices at neighboring Delphi, to have elaborated the sketches of his lectures and essays, which have come down to us under the collective name of
    <i>
     Morals
    </i>
    , and to have composed the work on which his fame chiefly rests,  the
    <i>
     Parallel Lives of Greeks and Romans.
    </i>
    He lived through the reigns of Nero, Domitian, and Trajan, and, leaving the world as he did about 120
    <span class="small">
     A.D.
    </span>
    , must have rejoiced at the accession of Hadrian to the imperial throne. His world had grown steadily better while he lived, and was now to enjoy its second golden age.
   </p>
   <p class="justify">
    The
    <i>
     Morals
    </i>
    were composed, for the greater part, before the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    , and are an invaluable prelude to and commentary on them, especially if we would
    <a id="pxiii">
    </a>
    <span class="noindex pagenum">
     p.xiii
    </span>
    know just what manner of man the author of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    was. They tell us, as the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    do not, "of the points of view, moral and religious, from which he contemplated not this man's life or the other's, but the whole life of men. Nor is it too much to affirm that of the two halves of Plutarch's writings, of his
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    and his
    <i>
     Morals
    </i>
    , each constitutes a complement of the other; the one setting forth to us, and, so far as this was possible, from ideal points of view, what the ancient world had accomplished in the world of action, and the other what, in like manner, it had aimed at and accomplished in the world of thought" (Trench,
    <i>
     Plutarch
    </i>
    , p90). But even in the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    , Plutarch is far more moralist than historian.
   </p>
   <p class="justify">
    Greece, after passing under Roman sway, lost sight gradually of her great men of action, and contented herself with the glories of her men of thought. Here surely the dominant Romans could not viewith her. It was to prove that the more remote past of Greece could show its lawgivers, commanders, statesmen, patriots, and orators, as well as the nearer and therefore more impressive past of Rome, that the
    <i>
     Parallel Lives
    </i>
    were written. With Scipio Africanus the Elder, the greatest man of Rome, Plutarch matched Epaminondas, the greatest man of Greece. This pair, or "book," of
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    is unfortunately lost. With Camillus, who saved Rome from the Gauls, he matched Themistocles, who saved Athens from the Persians. Then followed, as nearly

    <span class="noindex pagenum">

    </span>
    as the order can be determined  for the order of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    in our collection is not the original one, the
    <i>
     Cimon and Lucullus
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Lycurgus and Numa
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Demosthenes and Cicero
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Pelopidas and Marcellus
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Lysander and Sulla
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Philopoemen and Flamininus
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Pericles and Fabius Maximus
    </i>
    , the
    <i>
     Aristides and Cato Major
    </i>
    , and thirteen other pairs. Eighteen of the twenty-two pairs which have come down to us, close with a formal comparison of the two careers and characters. This is often fanciful and forced, abounds in contrasts rather than resemblances, and is seldom of any special historical value, although it often has great literary charm. There are also four single
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    in our collection,
    <i>
     Artaxerxes, Aratus, Galba
    </i>
    , and
    <i>
     Otho
    </i>
    , and we get traces of twelve more that are now lost. One of the pairs is a double one, where, to match the two Gracchi, Plutarch selects the two reforming Spartan kings, Agis and Cleomenes. We have in all, therefore, fifty
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    by Plutarch.

    <i>
     Parallel Lives
    </i>
    by Sintenis (Leipsic, 183946, 4voll.8vo), which still remains the standard edition (Sintenis
    <span class="superscript">

    </span>
    ). Aminor edition of this work appeared in the
    <i>
     Bibliotheca Teubneriana
    </i>
    (Leipsic, 185255, 5voll.12mo, re-issued without much change in187375). It shows more boldness in the correction of obvious error, and greater freedom in the admission of conjecture, than the major edition, but is the most generally accepted text of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    (Sintenis
    <span class="superscript">
     2
    </span>
    ). The Tauchnitz text, edited by Immanuel Bekker (Leipsic, 185557, 5voll.8vo), does not differ very much from the first minor edition of Sintenis, but has a convenient division of the chapters into sections, which has been adopted in the present text.

    In1559 appeared the French version of the
    <i>
     Parallel Lives
    </i>
    by Jacques Amyot, the earliest French classic recognized by the French Academy. Amyot consulted many
    <span class="small">
     MSS.
    </span>
    unknown to the authors of the Juntine and Aldine editions, and his work has an independent philological value, aside from its great literary merits.

    It was from Amyot's version, rather than from the original Greek, that SirThomas North made his version of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    (1579), a translation by the earliest master of great English prose from the earliest master of great French prose. Shakespeare used this version in his
    <i>
     Coriolanus, Julius Caesar
    </i>
    , and
    <i>
     Antony and Cleopatra.
    </i>
    It was the Elizabethan Plutarch.
   </p>
   <p class="justify">
    In Queen Anne's time, Dryden was "prevailed upon by his necessities" to head a company of translators of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    , and the version was called by his name(1683), although he furnished merely the Preface and the Life of Plutarch. Notwithstanding all the failings of this motley version, it supplanted that of North.
   </p>
   <p class="justify">
    The first scholar's translation of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    from the original Greek into English, by the brothers John and William Langhorne, was published in1770, and was the version most current from that time down to1850. Compared with North's spirited version, it is rather dull and pedantic, although much more accurate.
   </p>
   <p class="justify">
    Arthur Hugh Clough's revision of the socalled Dryden translation, a work which occupied this gifted scholar and poet for some seven years, was published in five volumes by Little, Brown &amp;Co., of Boston, in1859, and reprinted in one large octavo volume in1876 and1880. It is probably the best extant English version of all the
    <i>
     Lives.
    </i>

   <p class="justify">
    The best monograph on Plutarch in English is
    <a id="pxix">

    <span class="noindex pagenum">
     p.xix
    </span>
    that of Archbishop Trench, which was published by the Messrs. Macmillan &amp;Co. in1873, and in a second edition in1874. Ralph Waldo Emerson had already furnished a characteristic essay on Plutarch as an Introduction to Goodwin's revision of the translation of the
    <i>
     Morals
    </i>
    "by several hands" (Boston, Little, Brown &amp;Co., 1870, reprinted,1889). To the edition of North's translation of the
    <i>
     Lives
    </i>
    in the "Tudor Translations" (London, David Nutt, 189596), the Rt.Hon. George Wyndham furnished an Introduction of superlative power and excellence. Professor Mahaffy's chapters on Plutarch in his
    <i>
     Greek World under Roman Sway
    </i>
    (Macmillan &amp;Co., 1890, pp291350 =
    <i>
     The Silver Age of the Greek World
    </i>
    , Chicago and London, 1906, pp339402) abound in discriminating and suggestive appreciations. Finally, mention may be made of
    <i>
     Plutarch's Themistocles and Aristides
    </i>
    , newly translated, with Introduction and Notes, by Bernadotte Perrin, NewYork, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1901.
