  <h1>
   Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan
  </h1>
  <h2>
   Kamakura
  </h2>
  <p>
   Kamakura was the capital of Japan for a brief time in history. Like Kyoto,
but on a smaller scale, Kamakura is rich with temples and shrines scattered
about the city. Because of its close proximity to Toyko, Kamakura is one of
Tokyo's most popular day trips.

  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Daibutsu
   </i>
   simply means "large buddha". This is an image of Amida,
probably the most popular of Japanese buddha. For 20 yen you can enter the
daibutsu and rub his stomach for good luck from the inside.
  </p>

   Buddhist gods protecting the entrance of Sugimoto Temple
  </p>
  <p>
   The "Nio" gods (two kings) pronouncing the first ("a") and last ("n")
sounds in the Sanskrit alphabet. Sugimoto Temple is Kamakura's oldest
temple and holds three important images of the
   <i>
    juichimen
   </i>
   (eleven-head)
Cannon Bosatsu. Besides these three images which are kept visible but at a
safe distance from the public, there are numerous large images including a
another eleven-head Cannon Bosatsu, Jizo, and an image of Bishamonten standing
on two demons.
  </p>
  <p class="photo">

   <br/>
   Small jizo statues lied up at the Hasedera (Hase Canon Temple)
  </p>
  <p>
   Hasedera is worth the visit. There you can see 9.18 meter standing Canon
Bosatsu statue. The grounds and the temple are both beautiful. Next trip to
Kamakura be sure to visit.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Yokohama
  </h2>
  <p>
   Yokohama is the capital of Kanagawa prefecture and the second largest
city in Japan. From the moment I stepped out of Sakuragicho station in
Yokohama and hit the streets I knew I would love this city. I visited Yokohama
to go to the "International Triennale of Contemporary Art Exhibition" but
found the city itself and the people having fun there just as interesting.

   Covered moving walkway leading to Landmark Tower
  </p>
  <p>
   From the station, this covered moving walkway leads to the 69-floor
Landmark Tower, which is the tallest building in Japan boasting the fastest
elevator in the world that brings you from the 2nd floor to the 69th floor in
40 sec.
  </p>
  <p class="photo">

   <br/>
   Landmark Plaza Shopping Mall just below the tower.
  </p>
  <p>
   It can't be seen in this photo but on either side of the marble staircase
from top to bottom were waterfalls. Very classy Mall.
  </p>
  <p class="photo">
   <img alt="queenssquare" src="queenssquare.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   Queen's Square
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the mall to the other side is Queen's Square and the Hard Rock Cafe.
Queen's Square is a popular area for street entertainers to do their thing
and reminded me of New York's Washington Square. Here you can watch
foreigners, speaking in flawless Japanese, entertain the crowds by juggling
fire, chainsaws, or knives.

   Yokohama landscape
  </p>
  <p>
   Yokohama is an interesting mix of architectures including modern
buildings, old ships, and an amusement park near the water. The left-most
building is the Landmark tower and the building to the far right is the
Pacifico Hotel.

   Worker boils "black eggs" in an onsen
  </p>
  <p>
   Owakudani stop accessible by ropeway. Here a worker is boiling eggs in an
onsen which causes the shells to turn black. The eggs are sent down a small
cargo ropeway to the shops below by the parking lot. They can be bought there
or at the shop near the onsen itself, which is a short 10 min. hike from the
parking lot. If you go to Hakone ask about the "Hakone Free Pass" which can be
purchased in Odawara station.
