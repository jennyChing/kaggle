           read by Robert Pinsky
          </small>
          <p>
           <br/>
           "Oh you on that side of the sacred river,"
           <br/>
           turning the point of her words towards me
           <br/>
           when the edge itself has seemed sharp to me,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           she began again, going on without pausing,
           <br/>
           "Say, say whether this is true: your confession
           <br/>
           must be joined to such accusation."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           What strength I had was so bewildered that
           <br/>
           my voice stirred and was done before it
           <br/>
           was set free of the organs that made it.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           She scarcely waited, and then said, "What do you
           <br/>
           think? Answer me, for the water has not
           <br/>
           cancelled the sad memories in you yet."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Bewilderment and fear mingled together
           <br/>
           forced out of my mouth such a "yes" that
           <br/>
           to hear it one would have had to see it.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As a crossbow, when it is drawn too far,
           <br/>
           breaks both the cord and the bow so that
           <br/>
           the shaft strikes the target with less power,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           so I broke under that heavy burden,
           <br/>
           with tears and sighs out of me pouring
           <br/>
           and my voice collapsed in its opening.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           At that she said to me, "In your desires of me
           <br/>
           which to the love of that good were leading you
           <br/>
           beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           what ditches dug across the way, or chains
           <br/>
           did you come to, that forced you to abandon
           <br/>
           any hope that you had of going on,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           and what attractions or advantages
           <br/>
           were visible on the brows of the others
           <br/>
           so that you had no choice but to loiter there?"
           <br/>
           <br/>
           After I had drawn a bitter sigh
           <br/>
           I had scarcely any voice to answer,
           <br/>
           and my lips formed it with great labor.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In tears I said, "Things of the moment
           <br/>
           with their false pleasure turned my steps away
           <br/>
           at once, after your face was hidden."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And she, "If you had said nothing or denied
           <br/>
           what you confess, your guilt would be noted
           <br/>
           nevertheless, by such a judge is it known!
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But when the accusation of the sin
           <br/>
           bursts from the cheeks of the accused, in our court
           <br/>
           it turns the grindstone against the edge again.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           All the same, so that now you may bear
           <br/>
           the shame of your mistakes, and when you hear
           <br/>
           the sirens another time you may be stronger,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           lay down the sowing of tears and listen
           <br/>
           so you may hear how my flesh in the tomb
           <br/>
           should have led you in the other direction.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Never did nature or art show you such
           <br/>
           beauty as the lovely members in which
           <br/>
           I was enclosed, and they are crumbled in earth.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And if the highest beauty, with my dying,
           <br/>
           so failed you, what mortal thing after that
           <br/>
           should have drawn you into desiring it?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Indeed at the first arrow of deceptive
           <br/>
           things you should have risen and followed after
           <br/>
           me, who was of that kind then no longer.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Your wings should not have been weighed down by any
           <br/>
           girl or other vanity so briefly
           <br/>
           known, waiting to shot repeatedly.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Two or three times a fledgling bird will wait
           <br/>
           but in vain is the net spread or arrow shot
           <br/>
           before the eyes of the bird when it has grown."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As children stand feeling ashamed, without
           <br/>
           a word, their eyes on the ground, listening,
           <br/>
           admitting what they have done and repenting,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           so I stood there, and she said, "Since what you
           <br/>
           hear is painful, lift up your beard and you
           <br/>
           will find that what you see is even more so."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           With less resistance the massive oak is
           <br/>
           uprooted, whether by the wind out of our own
           <br/>
           regions or that from the land of Iarbas,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I lifted my chin then at her command,
           <br/>
           and when she summoned my face by the beard
           <br/>
           I felt the full venom of the argument.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And when my face had opened, my eyes
           <br/>
           came to see that those primal creatures
           <br/>
           had paused in the scattering of flowers,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           and my eyes, when they were still uncertain
           <br/>
           of what they saw, saw that Beatrice had turned
           <br/>
           toward the beast that in two natures is one person.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Under her veil and across the stream, it seemed
           <br/>
           to me she surpassed her former self even more
           <br/>
           than she surpassed the others when she was here.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The nettle of the remorse so stung me there
           <br/>
           that the thing among all others that had most
           <br/>
           bent me to love it, I hated worse.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Such recognition ate at my heart that
           <br/>
           I fell, overcome, and what I became then
           <br/>
           she knows who was the reason for it.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Then, when my heart gave my outward sense again
           <br/>
           to me, I saw the lady I had found alone
           <br/>
           above me, and she said, "Hold onto me! Hold onto
        me!"
           <br/>
           <br/>
           She had drawn me into the river up to my
           <br/>
           throat, and pulling me after her, she
           <br/>
           was moving, light as a shuttle, over the water.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When I was near the blessed shore I heard
           <br/>
           "Purge me" chanted so sweetly that it
           <br/>
           cannot be written or even remembered.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The beautiful lady opened her arms,
           <br/>
           embraced my head and drew me under
           <br/>
           so that I had to swallow the water.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Then she brought me out and, bathed now, led me
           <br/>
           into the dance of the beautiful four
           <br/>
           and each of them held an arm over me.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "We are nymphs here and are stars in heaven.
           <br/>
           Before Beatrice went down into the world
           <br/>
           we were ordained to be her handmaidens.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We will take you to her eyes. But in the happy
           <br/>
           light within them, the three on the other
           <br/>
           side will sharpen yours, for they see more
        deeply."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So they began to sing, and they drew me
           <br/>
           with them to the breast of the griffin
           <br/>
           where Beatrice stood, turned in our direction,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           and said "Be careful not to look away now.
           <br/>
           We have brought you before the emeralds
           <br/>
           from which Love shot its arrows once at you."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A thousand desires hotter than a flame
           <br/>
           held my eyes fixed on those shining eyes
           <br/>
           that were fixed on the griffin the whole time.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Like the sun in a mirror, not otherwise,
           <br/>
           the double beast was shining in her eyes
           <br/>
           now one with nature, now with the other.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Think, reader, whether I marveled, seeing
           <br/>
           the object remain still in itself, and
           <br/>
           only the image of it changing.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           While my soul, full of amazement and joy,
           <br/>
           was tasting that nourishment which always
           <br/>
           is enough, and for which one remains hungry,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           the other three, who by their bearing showed
           <br/>
           their higher order, came dancing forward
           <br/>
           to the angelic measure their feet followed.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Turn, Beatrice, turn your holy eyes,"
           <br/>
           they were saying, "to your faithful one who
           <br/>
           has traveled so many steps to see you.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Out of your grace, grace us by unveiling
           <br/>
           your mouth to him, so that he may perceive
           <br/>
           the second beauty which you are concealing."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Oh splendor of the living eternal light,
           <br/>
           who has ever grown so pale in the shadow
           <br/>
           of Parnassus, or has drunk from its well so
           <br/>
           <br/>
           as not to have a mind that seems encumbered,
           <br/>
           trying to render you as you appeared
           <br/>
           there shaded by the harmonies of heaven,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           when you disclosed yourself to the open air?
