Well, a small patch that did a few big things in terms of loot. It solved the game's since-launch problem of the smarmy Cryptarch, a vendor who would \"decrypt\" your random item engrams, and often reveal gear or weapons of a worse quality than you expected.\r\n\r\nRare engrams would often given lesser Uncommon items, and most frustratingly, Legendary engrams, seen once in a blue moon, would almost never actually give you a Legendary item, plaguing you with a Rare or Uncommon item instead.\r\n\r\nThat's been resolved now, as Rare engrams will give Rare items and Legendary engrams will give Legendary items. It's a good step forward, but it's hard to imagine how anyone ever thought it would good design to have an extremely rare item generator give out garbage the vast majority of the time. The patch also comes with a few reward tweaks, offering potentially better gear for lengthy Strikes, making the grind a little more bearable.\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13059\" alt=\"machine gun2\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/machine-gun2.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Destiny's loot system still has a long ways to go.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Destiny reminds me (and many others, as I've heard this said before) of Diablo 3 at launch, at least in terms of itemization and its many loot problems.\r\n\r\nD3 had an enormous amount of problems that extended beyond loot at launch (like not actually working much of the time, and a complete and utter lack of endgame), but I think the loot comparisons are the most apt here. Destiny is certainly in better overall shape than Diablo 3 was at launch, yet they're suffering from many of the same gear-related issues.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Diablo 3 has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few years, and has fixed most of its loot problems to the point where I think it's now almost a model for loot systems in other games. As such, we'll go through how Destiny can learn through Diablo's loot failures, and its eventual successes.\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13060\" alt=\"warlock3\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/warlock3.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Some Form of Trading is a Must&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nEven ahead of launch, it was a monumentally controversial decision for Destiny to not have any sort of trading system whatsoever. Bungie's stated philosophy was that they wanted players to \"have an epic story for each piece of loot\" and they wanted Guardians to forge their own path through gear they found. Really, the larger issue Bungie was trying to avoid was the creation of any sort of black market for gear, something that plagues every game with a trading system.\r\n\r\nI suppose Destiny did learn something from Diablo 3, and didn't implement anything like D3's horrendous Auction House, opting to skip possible solutions and ban trading altogether. To me, that seems like the easy way out, and has created different, equally irritating problems within the game.\r\n\r\nFor example, I recently started a new set of Destiny characters on the Xbox One version of the game so I could play with my friend who owns that console. The first Exotic item he received once we were max level? A Warlock helmet. The first exotic item I got? A Hunter chestplate. Very cool, except &lt;i&gt;he's&lt;/i&gt; a Hunter, and &lt;i&gt;I'm &lt;/i&gt;a Warlock, and that means these two incredibly rare, Exotic items will sit in our inventories collecting dust unless we decide to level new characters to level 20 in order to use them. It's an incredibly maddening system when your friends can't give you extremely valuable gear that would help you immensely, yet they can't use at all, and some sort of friends-only trading system has to be implemented so this stops happening. Diablo 3 has an interesting idea where it allows for a limited window of trading of items before they're \"bound\" to your account. It's not a total fix, as even after its implemented, the items we already have couldn't be traded, but it's a start, and it should be up to Bungie to figure out a good solution for this.\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13062\" alt=\"destiny boss3\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/destiny-boss3.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=\"padding: 20px 0pt;margin: 20px 0pt;border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD;border-top: 1px solid #DDDDDD\"&gt;&lt;a style=\"text-decoration:none;color:#900;font: bold 20px/26px Georgia\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/fanboy-wars-the-fight-for-the-future-of-video-games/?utm_source=articlelink&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=fanboyebook\"&gt;Fanboy Wars: The Newest eBook From Forbes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a style=\"text-decoration:none;font: 15px/18px  Georgia;color:#000\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/fanboy-wars-the-fight-for-the-future-of-video-games/?utm_source=articlelink&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=fanboyebook\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fight For The Future Of Video Games&lt;/em&gt; is a warts-and-all look at the clashes between the video game business and its passionate fans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Bosses Have to Drop Something, Anything&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nDestiny has a strange problem where it allows any enemy to drop any type of high level item or engram, no matter what their own power level. That means a level 6 Dreg has the same chance of dropping a good item as a superpowered level 24 Knight, and leads to farming styles that reward loot cave-type exploits which allow for quick-killing of hordes of crappy enemies.\r\n&lt;!--donotpaginate--&gt;\r\nWhile Diablo 3 allows Legendary items to drop in the wild from low-level, easy-to-kill enemies on occasion, the best loot most often comes from the enemies that are hardest to kill. This can be \"Elite\" packs of enemies, or from one of the game's myraid of bosses.\r\n\r\nBut in Destiny? Elite enemies don't appear to give anything better than normal enemies, and bosses literally drop no items at all. At the end of a 45 minute Strike with a final boss that took a solid 20 minutes to kill, to see his body dissolve only to reveal nothing but House Banners (the equivalent of a few bucks) is disheartening. This is presumably because players are rewarded with random gear at the end of the mission in the stats screen, but again, this is very poor design.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of killing a boss is disconnected from the appearance of the final screen where the gear actually appears. Ideally, each boss would drop at least one engram of variant rarity in addition to the end of Strike rewards. Or if that's too much loot, then they should drop one or two engrams. That would avoid frustrating situations where players see that the guy who showed up 30 minutes late to the Strike and killed 10 enemies to their 130 got double the loot rewards, as engram drops in the game are only seen by the player.\r\n\r\nIt's just silly to not have any sort of tactile reward for defeating the toughest enemies of the game, relegating it to a post-mission stats screen instead.\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13063\" alt=\"destiny gauntlets\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/destiny-gauntlets.jpg\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Legendary Items Need to Feel Legendary&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nDiablo 3's biggest problem at launch, other than the Auction House, was the fact that the game launched with Legendary items that were lackluster in every way. There weren't many of them, they rarely dropped, and when they did, it was entirely possible that Rare items were actually better. A few had unique stats, but outside of visuals, there was almost nothing that made them sought-after pieces of gear most of the time.\r\n\r\nThrough D3's endless series of patches, Legendary items have grown incredibly formidable in the game, adding on crazy affixes that cause chain lightning on hit, summon angels and demons to fight with you, or dramatically change the way your inborn abilities work.\r\n\r\nDestiny hasn't launched with Legendary gear that's quite that bad, but there are still many areas in which its items are lacking.\r\n\r\nExotic gear is in an okay place, with affixes that actually have the potential to be game-changing, and incredibly unique-looking and cool models. The problem, of course, is that players are restricted to only one Exotic weapon and one Exotic piece of armor, filling out their other slots with rares or Legendaries, if they can manage it.\r\n\r\nLegendaries themselves are in a strange place. Their damage and armor is higher, and they have slightly better or more affixes than their Rare brethren, but they lack the wow-factor of Exotics, or D3's new era Legendary items. This is very much apparently visually, as some Legendaries use the exact same model as rare items, sometimes not even bothering to change color. Its' simply the same gun with more stuff. Legendary armor usually does not have any of skill-modifying affixes that Exotic gear has, making it relatively mundane and useful only for increasing Light level.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Bungie doesn't want to get too crazy with unique gear affixes because it has the potential to dramatically unbalance the Crucible, the game's PvP mode. Though damage and health are normalized in that arena, affixes still are in effect. Even with the limited ones in place now, that leads to unbalanced matchups between players in Rare gear, and those decked out in Exotics and Legendaries. Making those items even more distinct would only exacerbate that issue.\r\n\r\nBut so what? Normalize everything in the Crucible. Don't let affixes come into play at all, and unlock the potential for items to be truly fantastic and creative. It's not worth having 80% of top tier items be boring to maintain some sort of balance in a specific game mode, which is already unbalanced anyway under the current system.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, while Rare and Legendary engrams dropping Rare and Legendary gear consistently is a good thing, it's also pretty blindingly obvious, and there are still a lot of major issues Destiny has to address in terms of its loot system. Making the Cryptarch less of a pariah is a start, but the game should look to the mistakes and ultimate triumphs of Diablo 3 in order to avoid taking a multi-year road to turn their game into what it should be.\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;Follow me&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTassi\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, like my page&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paulttassi\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Exodus-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B009BQ4VVI/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Last Exodus&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;and&nbsp;its sequel,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Exiled-Earthborn-Exodus-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00E2YSI1S\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Exiled Earthborn&lt;/a&gt;, along with my new Forbes book,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fanboy-Wars-Fight-Future-Video-ebook/dp/B00KWMWZBS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402496109&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fanboy+wars\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Fanboy Wars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should Destiny spend its $500M budget?

you may have heard, Destiny rolled out &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/10/01/destiny-patch-1-0-2-tweaks-legendary-loot-drops/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;a big patch yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. Well, a small patch that did a few big things in terms of loot. It solved the games since-launch problem of the smarmy Cryptarch, a vendor who would decrypt your random item engrams, and often reveal gear or weapons of a worse quality than you expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rare engrams would often given lesser Uncommon items, and most frustratingly, Legendary engrams, seen once in a blue moon, would almost never actually give you a Legendary item, plaguing you with a Rare or Uncommon item instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thats been resolved now, as Rare engrams will give Rare items and Legendary engrams will give Legendary items. Its a good step forward, but its hard to imagine how anyone ever thought it would good design to have an extremely rare item generator give out garbage the vast majority of the time. The patch also comes with a few reward tweaks, offering potentially better gear for lengthy Strikes, making the grind a little more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13059\" alt=\"machine gun2\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/machine-gun2.jpg\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, Destinys loot system still has a long ways to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Destiny reminds me (and many others, as Ive heard this said before) of Diablo 3 at launch, at least in terms of itemization and its many loot problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;D3 had an enormous amount of problems that extended beyond loot at launch (like not actually working much of the time, and a complete and utter lack of endgame), but I think the loot comparisons are the most apt here. Destiny is certainly in better overall shape than Diablo 3 was at launch, yet theyre suffering from many of the same gear-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, Diablo 3 has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few years, and has fixed most of its loot problems to the point where I think its now almost a model for loot systems in other games. As such, well go through how Destiny can learn through Diablos loot failures, and its eventual successes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13060\" alt=\"warlock3\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/warlock3.jpg\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some Form of Trading is a Must&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even ahead of launch, it was a monumentally controversial decision for Destiny to not have any sort of trading system whatsoever. Bungies stated philosophy was that they wanted players to have an epic story for each piece of loot and they wanted Guardians to forge their own path through gear they found. Really, the larger issue Bungie was trying to avoid was the creation of any sort of black market for gear, something that plagues every game with a trading system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose Destiny did learn something from Diablo 3, and didnt implement anything like D3s horrendous Auction House, opting to skip possible solutions and ban trading altogether. To me, that seems like the easy way out, and has created different, equally irritating problems within the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I recently started a new set of Destiny characters on the Xbox One version of the game so I could play with my friend who owns that console. The first Exotic item he received once we were max level? A Warlock helmet. The first exotic item I got? A Hunter chestplate. Very cool, except &lt;i&gt;hes&lt;/i&gt; a Hunter, and &lt;i&gt;Im &lt;/i&gt;a Warlock, and that means these two incredibly rare, Exotic items will sit in our inventories collecting dust unless we decide to level new characters to level 20 in order to use them. Its an incredibly maddening system when your friends cant give you extremely valuable gear that would help you immensely, yet they cant use at all, and some sort of friends-only trading system has to be implemented so this stops happening. Diablo 3 has an interesting idea where it allows for a limited window of trading of items before theyre bound to your account. Its not a total fix, as even after its implemented, the items we already have couldnt be traded, but its a start, and it should be up to Bungie to figure out a good solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13062\" alt=\"destiny boss3\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/destiny-boss3.jpg\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"padding: 20px 0pt;margin: 20px 0pt;border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD;border-top: 1px solid #DDDDDD\"&gt; \n &lt;a style=\"text-decoration:none;color:#900;font: bold 20px/26px Georgia\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/fanboy-wars-the-fight-for-the-future-of-video-games/?utm_source=articlelink&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=fanboyebook\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Fanboy Wars: The Newest eBook From Forbes&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;br /&gt; \n &lt;a style=\"text-decoration:none;font: 15px/18px  Georgia;color:#000\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/fanboy-wars-the-fight-for-the-future-of-video-games/?utm_source=articlelink&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=fanboyebook\" target=\"_self\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fight For The Future Of Video Games&lt;/em&gt; is a warts-and-all look at the clashes between the video game business and its passionate fans.&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bosses Have to Drop Something, Anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Destiny has a strange problem where it allows any enemy to drop any type of high level item or engram, no matter what their own power level. That means a level 6 Dreg has the same chance of dropping a good item as a superpowered level 24 Knight, and leads to farming styles that reward loot cave-type exploits which allow for quick-killing of hordes of crappy enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While Diablo 3 allows Legendary items to drop in the wild from low-level, easy-to-kill enemies on occasion, the best loot most often comes from the enemies that are hardest to kill. This can be Elite packs of enemies, or from one of the games myraid of bosses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But in Destiny? Elite enemies dont appear to give anything better than normal enemies, and bosses literally drop no items at all. At the end of a 45 minute Strike with a final boss that took a solid 20 minutes to kill, to see his body dissolve only to reveal nothing but House Banners (the equivalent of a few bucks) is disheartening. This is presumably because players are rewarded with random gear at the end of the mission in the stats screen, but again, this is very poor design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling of killing a boss is disconnected from the appearance of the final screen where the gear actually appears. Ideally, each boss would drop at least one engram of variant rarity in addition to the end of Strike rewards. Or if thats too much loot, then they should drop one or two engrams. That would avoid frustrating situations where players see that the guy who showed up 30 minutes late to the Strike and killed 10 enemies to their 130 got double the loot rewards, as engram drops in the game are only seen by the player.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Its just silly to not have any sort of tactile reward for defeating the toughest enemies of the game, relegating it to a post-mission stats screen instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13063\" alt=\"destiny gauntlets\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/insertcoin/files/2014/10/destiny-gauntlets.jpg\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legendary Items Need to Feel Legendary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Diablo 3s biggest problem at launch, other than the Auction House, was the fact that the game launched with Legendary items that were lackluster in every way. There werent many of them, they rarely dropped, and when they did, it was entirely possible that Rare items were actually better. A few had unique stats, but outside of visuals, there was almost nothing that made them sought-after pieces of gear most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through D3s endless series of patches, Legendary items have grown incredibly formidable in the game, adding on crazy affixes that cause chain lightning on hit, summon angels and demons to fight with you, or dramatically change the way your inborn abilities work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Destiny hasnt launched with Legendary gear thats quite that bad, but there are still many areas in which its items are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Exotic gear is in an okay place, with affixes that actually have the potential to be game-changing, and incredibly unique-looking and cool models. The problem, of course, is that players are restricted to only one Exotic weapon and one Exotic piece of armor, filling out their other slots with rares or Legendaries, if they can manage it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Legendaries themselves are in a strange place. Their damage and armor is higher, and they have slightly better or more affixes than their Rare brethren, but they lack the wow-factor of Exotics, or D3s new era Legendary items. This is very much apparently visually, as some Legendaries use the exact same model as rare items, sometimes not even bothering to change color. Its simply the same gun with more stuff. Legendary armor usually does not have any of skill-modifying affixes that Exotic gear has, making it relatively mundane and useful only for increasing Light level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that Bungie doesnt want to get too crazy with unique gear affixes because it has the potential to dramatically unbalance the Crucible, the games PvP mode. Though damage and health are normalized in that arena, affixes still are in effect. Even with the limited ones in place now, that leads to unbalanced matchups between players in Rare gear, and those decked out in Exotics and Legendaries. Making those items even more distinct would only exacerbate that issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But so what? Normalize everything in the Crucible. Dont let affixes come into play at all, and unlock the potential for items to be truly fantastic and creative. Its not worth having 80% of top tier items be boring to maintain some sort of balance in a specific game mode, which is already unbalanced anyway under the current system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, while Rare and Legendary engrams dropping Rare and Legendary gear consistently is a good thing, its also pretty blindingly obvious, and there are still a lot of major issues Destiny has to address in terms of its loot system. Making the Cryptarch less of a pariah is a start, but the game should look to the mistakes and ultimate triumphs of Diablo 3 in order to avoid taking a multi-year road to turn their game into what it should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow me&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTassi\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, like my page&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paulttassi\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Exodus-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B009BQ4VVI/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Last Exodus&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;and&nbsp;its sequel,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Exiled-Earthborn-Exodus-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00E2YSI1S\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Exiled Earthborn&lt;/a&gt;, along with my new Forbes book,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fanboy-Wars-Fight-Future-Video-ebook/dp/B00KWMWZBS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402496109&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fanboy+wars\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Fanboy Wars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should Destiny spend its $500M budget?
