    Once Upon a Time
   </b>
   is an "apa,"* or "amateur
press association," sponsored by the Mythopoeic Society,
devoted to Children's Fantasy literature. The O.E. [Official Editor]
is Laura Krentz,

   Unlike the other Mythopoeic Society apa (
   <b>
    Butterbur's Woodshed
   </b>
   ,
devoted to Adult Fantasy),
   <b>
    OUaT
   </b>
   does not have set topics
for each issue. We simply raise a point for discussion and see
who responds in the next issue(s). Recently, one of our members
has announced that he's reading and planning to discuss Eleanor
Cameron's
   <i>
    The Seed and the Vision
   </i>
   in a forthcoming 'zine,
and one or two other members have indicated that they will join
him in this discussion. But more usually, someone will reminisce
about reading a book as a child, or tell of reading a book to
a child recently, and other members will chime in with their comments
over the next few issues. There is also a certain amount of personal
chit-chat, as in a personal letter, and this in turn occasions
some comment as members get to know one another. But that's characteristic
of in-person discussion groups, too. Many of the members review
the books that they have been reading, especially new books. This,
too, inspires some discussion. In the past we've had good discussions
of the works of Diana Wynne Jones, Carol Kendall, Jane Yolen,
Margaret Mahy, L.M. Boston, the Oz books, the art of several illustrators,
and many other topics in the area of Children's books and fantasy.

  <b>
   The Children's Fantasy Special Interest Group
  </b>
  was proposed as the parent group of
  <b>
   Once Upon a Time
  </b>
  . Its
existence is nebulous, apart from the apa, but it was certainly
involved in the planning and development of
  <a href="MYTHCON24.html">
   Mythcon
24
  </a>
  , "Down the Hobbit-hole and Through the Wardrobe: Fantasy
in Children's Literature," and in subsequent programming
at Mythcons, and perhaps at some other 'cons, as well. There is
also a certain overlap with the
  <a href="http://www.mythsoc.org/awards.html">
   Mythopoeic
Fantasy Award
  </a>
  for Children's Literature, one of the four awards
presented each year by the Society, and with the committee that
is formed to nominate and read the finalists for this award. This
year the award went to Diana Wynne Jones'
  <i>
   Crown of Dalemark
  </i>
  .
We generally find ourselves discussing some of the finalists,
and sometimes arguing over their relative merits. Often, some
of the
  <i>
   Mythprint
  </i>
  reviews of the award winners and finalists
have originated in
  <b>
   Once Upon a Time
  </b>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <hr align="LEFT"/>
  It's hard to represent an apa here on a web-page,
but I'm including some
  <a href="Krentz%20on%20books.html">
   reviews
  </a>
  by several of our members. The simultaneous comments on a
single book, characteristic of
  <b>
   Butterbur's Woodshed
  </b>
  , may
actually give a better feel for the sort of back and forth discussion
that can occur, and I've posted some examples
  <a href="Award%20Comments.html">
   here
  </a>
  from that apa, as well. But it's harder to pull out examples from
OUaT, because they tend to be sprinkled throughout several months
of issues, and thus harder to track down in retrospect--to say
nothing of editing and obtaining permission for quotation on this
web-page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What we'd really like from you is
  <a href="mailto:d-lena@maroon.tc.umn.edu">
   input
  </a>
  to
  <b>
   Once Upon a Time
  </b>
  and the Children's Mythopoeic Fantasy
Award, particularly about new children's fantasies. There are
so many published each year, it's hard to keep up. We hate to
overlook a wonderful book for our Award finalists, so please,
let us know if you read a new book that seems worthy of being
considered--or warn us against wasting our time and pennies on
a real loser. If you hear of a new book, even if you haven't read
it yet, but it's by an author whose past work has been admirable,
or if you want to ask for advice on whether to buy a new book,
it's not a bad idea to ask here for other readers' comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you just happen to get excited about a book that didn't recently
appear, even an older book, like (for example) Benary-Isbert's
  <i>
   The Wicked Enchantment
  </i>
  , or Mrs. Molesworth's
  <i>
   The Tapestry
Room
  </i>
  , or you have a sudden insight about
  <i>
   The Hobbit
  </i>
  or
  <i>
   The Sword in the Stone
  </i>
  ,
  <a href="mailto:d-lena@maroon.tc.umn.edu">
   drop
me a note
  </a>
  anyway: I'll post it here and we'll see if we elicit
any discussion. I'll also send it through the next
  <b>
   Once Upon
a Time
  </b>
  . That'll take time for a response (at least a couple
of months) but we're used to long conversations. There is a pleasure
in that which mostly escapes us here on the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One more thing, if you can think of links to sites on Children's
literature or children's writers, that might be of interest to
people visiting this site, pass them on to me, and I'll see about
including them, below.

   *An apa is a sort of discussion group by mail,
or correspondence circular, in which the members contribute in
the form of little personal "zines," in which they present
their comments and in particular, often comment on and respond
directly to comments in other members' zines from the previous
collation. These are separately produced, by each member, in a
quantity equal to the membership (usually plus a few extras for
sample copies) and mailed to the Official Editor, or O.E. The
O.E. collates the various contributions together and mails out
the resulting apa (also known as a "disty," probably
from distribution) to the members. This explanation is probably
influenced and shaped by my own experience in
   <b>
    OUaT
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    Butterbur's Woodshed
   </b>
   , the two MythSoc apas, so there may
be a lot of variation out there in the hundreds or thousands of
apas that exist.
