            It could explain the Chronic Fatigue Initiatives pathogen study results. It could show how an infection could cause chronic fatigue syndrome, and then seemingly disappear. It integrates two of the biggest players in ME/CFS; the autonomic nervous system and the immune system. It focuses on the herpesviruses.It includes sensory nerves, an increasingly hot topic in ME/CFS/FM, and it follows an established model of fibromyalgia.

            , and it could change how this disorder is viewed, researched and treated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Created by Michael VanElzakker, a Tufts neuroscientist, the VNIH proposes that nerve loving viruses trigger a difficult to detect immune response which produces the fatigue and other symptoms present in chronic fatigue syndrome.
           </p>

           <p>
            VanElzakker proposes that an infection triggers ME/CFS, but if his theory is right the most important thing about that infection is not what it isbut where it is.  That where is the biggest nerve in the body; the vagus nerve  a wandering nerve that stretches over much of our torso and sends its roots into most of the organs of the body.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vagus nerve isnt just any nerve; its the nervous systems immune conduit to the brain. VE believes that an infection there doesnt need to be large to cause havoc in the brain; it just needs to be present.
           </p>
           <p>
            In some ways, vagus nerve appears, in fact, to be ripe for infection in ME/CFS. As it wanders through the body it comes into contact with virus havens such as the esophagus, stomach, lungs and spleen, all of which have likely at one time or another harbored the herpesviruses (HHV6, HHV-5 [cytomegalovirus], HHV-4 [Epstein-Barr virus]) that have been thought to be associated with ME/CFS for decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most humans carry several of these herpesviruses in latent form unless some stressor or biological event allows them to become reactivated.

             Van Elzakker suggests ME/CFS is caused by localized infections associated with the vagus nerve
            </p>
           </div>
           <p>
            VanElzakker believes that upon reactivation these viruses replicate and move outside the nerves where they run into glial cells that attempt to gobble them up. The glial cells perk up remarkably in the presence of viruses, releasing all manner of pro-inflammatory and neuroexcitatory compounds (proinflammatory cytokines [IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-a], glutamate, prostaglandins, nitric oxide and free radicals. )
           </p>
           <p>
            Receptors on the vagus nerve that sniff out these alarm signals tell the brain an infection is present, which then shuts the body down by sending out signals (fatigue, flu-like symptoms, pain, etc.) that slow the body down, tell it to stop moving, stop eating, stop thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because these infections are localized right on the main immune conduit to the brain, VanElzakker believes they dont need to produce the outsized cytokine response researchers have been looking for.  All they need to do is tweak the vagus nerve and let it and the brain the do the rest.
           </p>
           <p>
            You dont need a big infection to produce ME/CFS; all you need is a little infection in the right place.

             The Key Component  Glial Cells

           </h3>
           <p>
            The glial cells that surround and protect the vagus nerve are the key. Once thought to be mere structural scaffolding for the nerves, these cells (e.g., astrocytes) are now known to regulate nervous system signaling, a fact thats been borne out inchronic fatigue syndromes sister disease, fibromyalgia.

             VE believes pathogen triggered,but localized immune system activation around the vagus nerves may be causing ME/CFS

           </div>
           <p>
            Glial cell release of cytokines, glutamate, free radicals, etc. in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord causes increased pain sensitivity and allodynia in susceptible individuals. At some point the constant production of these excitatory substances causes a switch to get flipped sending the pain response spiraling upwards instead of shutting down.
           </p>
           <p>
            At its most extreme (allodynia), the nervous system can interpret even the slightest touch as eliciting pain. The pain response system at this point, as VanElzakker, puts it, has become, pathological.
           </p>
           <p>
            That model of pain production has been solidly documented. VanElzakker proposes the same process causing pain sensitization in the dorsal horn is causing fatigue and other symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome, except this time its associated with glial cells surrounding the vagus nerve.

           <p>
            Nobody knows what a herpesvirus infection of the vagus nerve would look like, but VanElzakker doesnt see any reason it should look any different from an infection in other parts of the body.

             Herpesvirus infections of the trigeminal nerve cause shingles. Do herpesvirus infections of the vagus nerve cause chronic fatigue syndrome?
            </p>
           </div>
           <p>
            We know a herpesvirus infection of your trigeminal nerve gets you shingles and chronic pain. Researchers believe a chronic infection in the dorsal horn of your spinal cord will can get you fibromyalgia and allodynia. Would an infection of the vagus nerve get you sickness behavior and chronic fatigue syndrome?
           </p>
           <p>
            Theres a good chance it might. Animal studies indicate that fatigue/flu-like symptoms go gangbusters when the vagus nerve gets infected.In fact, its possible the flu-like symptoms associated with infections wouldnt even exist without the vagus nerve. Rodents with their vagus nerves cut dont act sick even after theyve been infected with a pathogen; the fevers, fatigue, the desire for isolation  are gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if the vagus nerve receptors wereceaselessly bombarded with these cytokines? The symptoms of sickness behavior would be severe and intractable.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the glial cells surrounding the vagus nerve function the same way they do in the dorsal horn, a lingering or even a smoldering infection (aka Dr. Lerners theory), could trigger the similar type of hypersensitive reaction in the vagus nerve. In this immune sensitization model, it takes only very small amounts of cytokines to trigger fatigue and flu-like behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, VanElzakker suggests chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia could both be glial cell diseases.

           <p>
            If VanElzakker is right, the same group of viruses are wreaking havoc in different locations in different ME/CFS patients. The problem is its just darn hard to get at them. You cant find them in the blood and you sure as heck cant biopsy the vagus nerve.
           </p>
           <p>
            A series of fascinating studies exploring how central nervous system infections cause chronic nerve pain may, however, illuminate whats happening in ME/CFS. First, researchers mimicked a localized nervous system infection by dropping an HIV protein known to activate glial cells into rodents spinal cord.

            They found that the glial cells reared up and starting producing pro-inflammatory cytokines to take care of the intruder. Not surprisingly, the rodents looked and acted sick  the cytokines were doing their job to keep the animal down and isolated  but
            <b>

            </b>
            of those cytokines could be found in their bloodstream. Only if the animals spinal cord was sampled near where the infection was it possible to find any evidence of increased cytokine levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            If VanElzakker is right, then blood cytokine levels in ME/CFS are a function of where your vagus nerve is infected. If its infected in your abdominal area, you might find cytokines in the blood, but it might be hard to find them in your spinal fluid. If your vagus nerve is infected near your brainstem you might find cytokines in the spinal fluid, but you probably wont find them in your blood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wherever the infection is theres a good chance you may not find cytokines in the blood at all. This isnt a completely surprising fact or even restricted to the vagus nerve infections; cytokines in mice with lung infections, for instance, showed up only when the lungs themselves were sampled.
           </p>

             Next Steps

           </h3>
           <p>
            VanElzakker suggests animal studies to better understandinfections of the vagus nerve and to ultimately to build a chronic fatigue syndrome rodent model would be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be able to detect viral lesions in central nervous system tissues. It is not yet known if PET scans can detect the activation of a different type of glial cells; the satellite glia that are in vagus nerve ganglia and paraganglia, but special PET scans might be able to be used to assess microglial activation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cadaver studies of people who had ME/CFS definitely arent his first choice, but they could find activated glia, inflammation and viral infections of the vagus nerve and associated structures. Finally, novel protocols should be developed to assess the vagus nerve and brainstem functioning in ME/CFS. The severely ill should be given a prominent place in future studies.

            If VEs theory is correct then glial cell inhibitors to stop the immune activation, antivirals to attack the pathogens, vagus nerve stimulation and surgical alteration of the vagus nerve might be possible treatments sometime in the future.

           <p>
            Ibudilast (AV411/MN166), a drug used mostly in Japan, knocks down glial cell activation by inhibiting the production of a proflammatory cytokine called macrophage-migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) and TNF-a. Reduced levels of TNF-a could provide a bonus by increasing the breakdown of a excitatory neurotransmitter called glutamate that may be helping to keep your central nervous system on edge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ibudilast is also known to have neuroprotective and vasodilative effects and is usually used to treat asthma and stroke. Its ability to suppress glial cell activation has made it useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain, and its currently undergoing clinical trials to treat neuropathic pain in Australia. Ibudilast can also prevent viral activation of the microglia.

            Stopping glial cell activation may be easier than getting at the viruses themselves. Herpesviruses living in the sensory ganglia may be protected from antiviral drugs and antibodies. (One new herpesvirus drug may be coming on the market soon, however.) Alternately, viruses other than the herpesviruses could be infecting the vagus nerve.

            This is exciting news and FYI: heres a tweet from VE  check out what he says on Aug. 10th:
            <a href="http://www.immunesystemmasterkey.com/basic/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.immunesystemmasterkey.com/basic/', 'http://www.immunesystemmasterkey.com/basic/');" rel="nofollow">
             http://www.immunesystemmasterkey.com/basic/
            </a>
             Says he is putting together a pilot study with Anthony Komaroff. VE also tweeted that the vagus nerve could be infected by a variety of things, not just viruses. It could be bacteria or mold and would explain why people under drastically different circumstances would be sick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any chance you could find out more about the pilot study?
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking forward to a breakthrough in this area in 2014. I believe hes on the right track! Maybe Simmaron would be interested in helping with the study?

              Given the similarity in symptoms between those with ME/CFS, FMS and Lyme (and related bacterial/protozoal) infections, Im with Gail here study shouldnt be limited to viral pathogens in the vagus nerve. Any source of inflammation/activation of the vagal glial cells might be causative if this theory holds up (see Marks comment as well).

              And dont forget about parasites.  Dr Klinghardt and others have stated that 80% CFSers have the parasite c. pulmoni,
              <br/>
              hidden lung worm, discovered by Dr Larry Klapowi.  I strongly believe that I have this parasite.  Its thought to have been a bat parasite that jumped species when we bombed the hell out of VietNam, and it came to the US with returning vets.  It is not contagious, but gets around via food and drink.  It is so small it is almost invisible.  There is much info re this on Google.

                Dr. Klinghardt believes a lot of things.  His list of causes and treatments increases every year since he needs them to keep in business.  Having said that, I do agree that parasites may be contributing to our illnesses, just not as per Klinghardt and his wacky, non-scientific ART testing system.

            Half a lifetime agobefore I even had my ME diagnosismy attempts at explaining all my symptoms led me to suspect an infection of the vagus.  I was, of courseand still amlaughed out of doctors surgeries and psychiatrists lairs, when I suggested that such things might be possible.  It is good to read that it is now acceptable to entertain such theories!

            I didnt have to read too far into the blog to realize that it all fits with the history and the present of my daughters suffering.  She is a perfect example of what this disease is about, unfortunately.  I strongly hope that Dr. VanElzakkers scientific theory is proven to be based on solid fact.  There are so many research projects going on around the world, focusing on an official diagnosis; however, it seems prudent to hope that Dr. VanElzakker has the correct answer.  It was kind of scary to read his description of the source of the disease:  it made so much sense to me, a lay person.  Why cant the research and medical experts realize what, it seems to me, to be there right in front of everyones nose?

              One nice thing about VEs hypothesis is how well he lays out. It has gotten a good response. Kristin Loomis (interview upcoming) of the HHV-6 Foundation loved it and hopefully it prompt some research efforts.

              I think may fit in well with Pridgens theory of Fibromyalgia, by the way. I could be wrong, but I think Pridgen is looking at similar nerve ganglia in the gut.

              The doctors cant acknowledge whats right in front of them because that would require admitting that they were wrong and the patient was right.

            EXCITING, hypothesis!!!! I hope more concrete research is done and treatment will be less hit and miss. A faulty immune system  seems to continue to show up. If we could get the immune system to detect what shouldnt be there and destroy it, we would be better off. My doc is using minocycline and doxycycline (as part of the treatment) with his patients. ( Depends on which pathogens are detected. ) It seems more  doctors are on this path of treatment. So wonderful that some of us are getting good results from it.

            This rings true for me  I have POTS and I have palpitations which I thought were heart related and had a holter monitor which found nothing serious. I believe the palpitations are in fact an overstimulated vagus nerve firing off, as they feel like an electric jolt in the centre of my chest  they are worse after eating or with stomach gas or when changing positions  all of which would put pressure on the vagus nerve. I know lots of people have them but I also have cold sores, including one in my nose that has been there for 3+ months!! I hope the research continues to be fruitful.

            It seems this hypothesis would be aligned with Dr Martinez Lavin proposal Heart rate variability (HRV) analyses provide a quantitative marker of autonomic nervous system Activity  in Lerma et al. Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy 2011, 13:R185

            See his (Matinez Lavin) kindle book  FIBROMYALGIA. How stress becomes real pain and what to do about or Fibromialgia paperback Spanish edition .(both books in Amazon.com)

           <p>
            Martinez Lavin said there is Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction in Fibromyalgia The sympathetic nervous system is overactive and the parasympathetic (read vagus nerve) is not acting..
            <br/>
            We should add to this the results of Dr. Daniel Dantini The new Fibromyalgia Remedy, (book 2008, Amazon.com). Dantini assumes (and shows some analyses) there is a hidden infection and treat his patients with antiviral drugs (70% success)

            This sounds like an  exciting direction to be going in to me too.  But one thing I dont understand.  If the elevated  cytokines are only found near the site of the infection, how do they cause general sickness behavior?  Wouldnt they have to be in high enough levels in the circulation to affect the brain and how it is running the body?  So then be detectable in blood samples? Or am I missing something here?

              My understanding is that the cytokines trigger the vagus nerve to tell the brain an infection is present. It appears that the vague nerves is the main immune nervous system conduit to the brain. Instead of cytokines in the blood getting to the brain and telling it that an infection is present, nervous system signals from the vagus nerve go straight to the brain telling it the same thing. If thats true all you need is a local chronic infection near the vagus nerve to cause sickness behavior.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think VEs suggestion that ME/CFS and FM could be disorders of the microglia is very interesting. Maybe the microglia are oversensitized to signs of infection or maybe they get damaged and keep pumping out cytokines

            This makes so much sense to me. I am compound heterozygous for MTHFR variants, so I got one from mother (1298) and one from father (677).  Mother, in her old age, used to have vagus nerve attacks that mimicked heart attacks, but which would pass in a short time.  Then she would be fine.  She seemed to have chronic fatigue and FM all her life, especially when stressed out.  I struggled along for decades, much like mother, until I finally got a CFS diagnosis.  I hope this theory proves correct and that an effective treatment can be found. It will simplify things for the medical community and help many people.

            Great to see others getting in on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im pretty convinced that hes getting to the core problem but glial activation doesnt require infection.  Micro and macro glia respond to tissue injury also (whether mechanical, due to hypoxia or ischemia) and peripheral injuries can result in the same systemic glial neuroinflammation (as seen in complex regional pain syndrome).   Small fibre polyneuropathy may be a similar driver in fibro.
           </p>
           <p>
            So given the difficulties in confirming a vagal nerve infection Id prefer them to go after the neuronflammation.  as you know one (unpublished) study appears to confirm microglial activation in ME/CFS using PET but there are also metabolic markers and Petersons CSF samples could well be gold dust.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS  Low dose Naltraxone is another glial inhibitor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exciting stuff all round though which begs the question of what exactly Lipkin found in the CSF samples?

            I would be very interested to see how this hypothesis fits with those people who respond to Rituximab (if at all.)
            <br/>
            Maybe they represent what is currently considered to be a sub-group, but who actually have a completely different pathology, (i.e. a B cell infection) and yet one which yields very similar symptoms.

            I understand how the sickness behavior could occur, especially with POTS and post exertional  malaise, but  does this theory address the immune problems resulting in actual sickness that so many CFS patients have?  My initial symptoms were many, many colds, sinus infections, and very low B cells. My colds were contagious, not sickness behavior.  Does sickness behavior cause immune suppression?

              In VEs model an initial infection or viral reactivation (or bacterial infection or mold) triggers everything; the problem I believe is that the infection got to your vagus nerve and it settled in there  and never stopped. The infection continues  it keeps tweaking the microglial cells  which pump out the cytokines which trigger the vagus nerve to tell the brain to produce sickness behavior. I think hes more focused on microglial inhibitors because he thinks its easier to stop the microglial activation than get at the infection.
             </p>
             <p>
              I suppose it is possible, though, that the microglia are keeping the infection downIn that case, I dont know if youd want to shut them off (???)

              In addition to POTS, MCAS and EDS I also have Hypogammaglobulinemia   which is low IGG levels and supposedly it would be hard for me to fight  off infections. I seldom get sick (colds, flu, etc.) But, interestingly -have autoimmune diseases    where my body attacks itself. (Vitiligo, allopecia, etc.) So, you can have both things going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              With me there was found a protozoa (FL1953)  and a co-infection related to Lyme. Treating this  and addressing my immune system and inflammation has been a HUGE help for me. Much inmprovement over the last year. Its   not  a quick fix thing, takes time. But the end results are what matter and Im so much better than I was.

            Interesting to read. ME came on after Glandular Fever in 1984. I now have widespread peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Somethings going on and the neuro-immune systems are tightly linked.

            I wonder if the CFS/ME scientific community has also embraced (or at least considered) the possibility of altered ganglionic function as a subset or a main reason of autonomic nervous system dysfunction.  The possibility that this alteration being the result of latent-residing, neurotropic Herpesviruses.  The basis for my curiosity goes back to the recent study that proved direct causality of gut dysmotility (weakened strength of involuntary gut muscle) following primary infection of Herpes Simplex infection in gastrointestinal tract of rat:

           </p>
           <p>
            The presumption here is that primary infection within the gut would subsequently have the virus travel up the Vegus nerve or establish latent infection in the associated Ganglion  Messenteric Ganglion or Celiac Ganglion.

            The scary part about any infection by Herpesviruses is that the virus has the potential to reside in ANY ganglion.  And if dysmotility is truly a hallmark of latent infection, i wonder what omnipresent ganglionic infection would cause in our body.  Would humans continue to experience autonomic dysfunction regardless of persistent infection?

            Imagine if the medical and science community proved that latent infection was the cause of a specific syndrome, e.g. Celiac infection of VZV or HSV was the cause of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  I would hope that the same theory would be applied to just about every other random experience:  random elevated heart rate, random asthmatic attacks, Acid Reflux Disease, Diahrea, Swallowing Difficulties, etc.  In fact, my belief on Acid Reflux disease is that the underlying cause is a disturbance of outside pathology or autonomic dysfunction not associated with latent infection.  Acid Reflux just doesnt come randomly
           </p>
           <p>
            I offer this analogy:  imagine riding a bicycle, and each pedal isnt tight and snug, but loose and wobbly.  Try pedaling.  Youll notice that the ability to transfer energy from you to the wheels, and to ultimately move the bicycle is ultimately disrupted.  Our brains transfer electrical signals and other stuff (hormone, and probably things I have never heard of) to your muscles and organs THROUGH the ganglion.  Ganglions are essentially conduits, or interfaces.  Interfere with those interfaces, and you may have something similar to the bicycle analogy I gave above, or something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome

            I want to add another thing:  given the subject of a single nerve being infected, imagine Herpes infection in any of the organs within the lungs  airway, alveolars, broncheal tubes, etc.  In a situation with persistent infection, and a dysfunctional immune system, the viruses will simply continue to infect and spread, claiming cell upon cell upon cell, until those cells are destroyed, causing necrosis.  Now, there are case studies that demonstrate Herpes Simplex to be associated with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis:  one of the most devastating and insidious diseases known to man.  All it takes is someone who is suffering one of these automimmune diseases, and somehow getting the virus into the airways.  Perhaps by accidental inhalation of HSV-containing saliva.

            Definitely dont wish this disease upon anyone, but it is simply another example of the endless number of organs or tissue that these viruses can infect, and cause persistent problems.

            Glial cell involvement is certainly not a new theory, we discuss it in our BIG book, but to see this follow up, to see scientists getting excited and carrying past research into the present is encouraging.  It is especially helpful for future generations. My own children are starting to show signs of living with these horrible disorders.  Your blog has been particularly helpful on a personal level.  Thank you Cort.

            I like this theory, it is elegant and it confirms what dr. Klinghardt has been saying: that CFS and Lyme are the same disease.

                I remember I read on a Betterhealthguy webpage that Klinghardt said CFS of unknown causes is probably Lyme. Before that I spoke to a Lyme patient and she kept telling me that my CFS symptoms were Lyme so I started googling and I found that website. I guess it doesnt matter the type of infection, what it matters is that it affects the vagus nerve.

            Any serious research into ME/CFS/FM is always welcome news  however I dont see how this hypothesis can explain the numerous occasions where a large number of people have developed ME at the same time?

              I think it could actually. It would just take a bug that was quite virulent and that happened, perhaps because of genetic susceptibility or because they were under stress, to get further into the body (I assume) than normal. One of the nice things about VEs hypothesis is that its kind of agnostic towards what kind of pathogen is present; it simply requires one to start the process off. Herpesviruses are the most obvious suspects because we know that they take up residence in those sites anyway.

            l am just so happy to see this can not read it all now but l feel this is so key. It also explains my eye problem and not being able to read very much, and the viral feeling in my optic nerve. l believe that the virus has not gone as my CT scan showed a UBO in the mid brain.

            Happy is not the enough to express how l feel.

            Interesting hypothesis.  Unfortunately, we appear to have another researcher completely ignorant of the day to day interactions patients have with the medical delivery industry.  He seems to be quite taken with the idea that CBT and GET can be very helpful to 30% of the patient population.  He doesnt seem to understand that most clinicians believe CBT and GET to be curative NOT complementary.  He seems to have a better grasp of infectious diseases and immunology than the shenanigans occurring in his own field in regards to ME [from his research paper]:
           </p>
           <p>
            Patients should be helped to understand that this is not the case and that resistance to psycho- logical and behavioral intervention is misguided. Both cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy have been shown in a randomized trial to be helpful for approximately 30% of indi- viduals with CFS [137]. While these effects were moderate, the fact that 30% of patients significantly improved from psychological and behavioral interventions  without any drugs or surgery  should not be ignored.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are two reasons that both psychological and behavioral interventions should be strongly recommended, along with the treatment options discussed above, to individuals with CFS.
           </p>
           <p>
            As if.

              Even patients surveys show CBT is helpful in about 30 percent of patients. Other people get benefits from meditation, Amygdala, etc. I think you added the very helpful part as well. Your quote says the effects were moderate and they affected about 30% of the patients. Thats a pretty moderate statement in my view and doesnt affect his main thesis at all  which is that an ongoing infection of the spinal cord causes ME/CFS. Hes not calling for more CBT studies; hes calling for better imaging, etc. studies and developing animal models and those are the kinds of things that this paper will spark.

                No, I am not missing his point which I think is very positive.  You seem to be missing the point that he doesnt recognize that many clinicians think that CFS is a psychological condition and can be CURED by CBT &amp; GET.  Do you not think there is harm in telling patients that they can be cured by these therapies?  I am for anything that brings  relief to people  including CBT, GET or listening to TV static; whatever works for individual circumstances.

               <p>
                He did state: 30% of patients significantly improved from psychological and behavioral interventions  without any drugs or surgery  should not be ignored.  I am not sure how you can have a moderate effect and at the same time significantly improve.  Which is it?
               </p>
               <p>
                Its too bad he had to sully an otherwise interesting paper on glowing references to the PACE trial that folks on PR have done a good job deconstructing.

            Cort, I wonder how Enteroviruses fit in with this theory?  Dr. Chias work  the biopsies he has studied of the parietal cells of the stomach (which I was extremely positive on) seems like it could relate to the vagus nerve easily since it seems to be everywhere else in the body in his research. I also have high antibodies for at least three forms of enterovirus including a couple Coxsackie viruses, in lab findings from ARUP Labs in Utah.  I dont hear enough about his work and the relationship to these theories and I dont understand why.  Even Dr. Lipkin did not talk about this type of biopsy looking for viruses in his last report of his testings and findings. All I remember is that when I got a stomach flu, it affected my brain and whole system in days. I could track it.

              I dont see why they wouldnt fit. So long as they can get to those nerves and infect them they should work.

            I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis after having CFS.  I believe the Vagus Nerve is at risk at being damaged permanently from having CFS on any patient with the disease. This disease damages more and more that is just starting to be discovered. I think more will come to be known in the future. Having Gastroparesis has been a very difficult challenge along with all the other symptoms of CFS/ME.

                I too have been told I have gastroparesis. I got this diagnosis after I had my gallbladder removed ( a mistake on my part for not following through on my end and just believing the doctor when he said it needed to come out, still not sure why) but afer that surgery, I became VERY ill. I had a throat scope (EKG?) and the GI said my stomach was FULL of food, and I had barely eaten in at least a month. She said since Im not diabetic, my vagus nerve had been nicked during surgery. Yet of course NO tests were mentioned to show this, and Ive been on the vagus nerve information search for over a year, meanwhile declining in health. Ive lost 50 lbs, down to 101. Im SURE I have vagus nerve damage due to something gone wrong during surgery Ive see many others post the same thing, GP after a surgery, gall bladder removal included. How can I find out more info on this? I just want to get better! But NO doctor will help me or discuss the vegus nerve. Id appreciate any advice or more links to help me on my endless, tiring search..

                  I have gastroparesis, too (for about the last 18 months, diagnosed, but had symptoms much longer).  I dont have CFS/ME, but I do have hypersomnia, and saw a link to this post and was curious because of my constant fatigue, even though it is different diagnostically from your illness.  There is no cure for gastroparesis, and in my experience, most gastroenterologists are not very knowledgeable, unless they specialize in motility disorders (mine does not).  I have learned a lot from support groups on Facebook, such as taking digestive enzymes, when to utilize liquid meal replacements, what foods to avoid, helpful websites, etc.  I still have flares, but it has been much better lately than when I first diagnosed.  My doctor really was of no help. Luckily, I have realized that it could be much worse, but I think Ive learned to minimize the effects even more. It is possible that your gastroparesis is idiopathic  that is, from an unknown cause. Thats how were classifying mine for now (though I pushed to investigate dysautonomia, the doctor brushed me off). The important part is learning to manage the symptoms anyway.  The Facebook groups are very supportive, even if a little inconsistent (the administrators get sick, too, and cant always post every day).  Just wanted to make you aware, and let you know there are kindred souls out there!

                  There are some CFS/ME folks in our Major Somnolence Disorder support group, too if youre looking for fellow sleepyheads, although most there have a hypersomnia or narcolepsy diagnosis!  I do hope you find a way to manage your symptoms and feel better.  Its a hard illness to deal with, especially when youre battling with other ones, too.

              Look into the possibility that you guys may have a parasite.  Some parasites cause symptoms that are the same as gastroparesis.  If your parasite/s is located in the stomach, digestive, there are many parasite cleanses that could work
              <br/>
              for you.  US doctors know next to nothing about parasites and many parasites dont show up in blood or feces.  If a lab says you test negative, all clear, it doesnt mean that you are.

            Daughter age 8 diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. She also ha 2 seizures. Age 12 started having migraines and neurocardiogenic syncope (fainting). Age 14 acid reflux. Age 16 fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. Age 19 grand mal seizures and memory loss. Age 20 mesialtemporal schlorosis. She is in severe pain, vomits, sleeps a lot or not at all, she cant remember things, and she feels as if she is going to faint and sometimes does on a daily basis. All that we have been told by Drs and the research I have conducted her whole life has stemmed from the vagal nerve. She is in great need of someone to do something to help her!

            Hi Cort  from the UK
            <br/>
            My Husband Dave has just been diagnosed with CFS/ME and whilst researching I came across your article, which is very interesting and make sense when there is so much conflicting information relating to this debilitating condition out there.
            <br/>
            I would like to ask you or anyone out there if you think that been over exposed to diesel fumes -working in the construction industry for nearly 3 years delivering millions of litres without any protection- could have impaired the immune system and lead to this condition ? After working this job for around 4 months Dave developed  daily headaches and lived on painkillers, then after around 6 or 7 months he contacted the worse bout of flu ever and still kept on working. after around a year of exposure we went on holiday and he spent most of the 2 weeks in bed weak and wiped out  which we put down to over working  this happened over the next 3 holidays we had ,he also started getting regular and more severe ear, sinus and throat infections- along with dizziness, so since being in that job from 2009 until 2012  here we are 2014 with a diagnosis of CFS/ME- any comments/feedback much appreciated. Thank you
           </p>

              Sandra  In 1978 I was diagnosed with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. I have tried to avoid chemicals as much as possible.Has helped as well as watching foods. Have been getting physicalm therapy treatments off and on for about 25 years. But still do not feel well. I believe that there is a problem with the Vegas nerve. Check out some of the sites about chemical sensitivity, I dont feel that I am at the bottom of my problem yet, but some relief is better than none

            SOOO interesting. I just found this after suffering a really weird reaction post-training session and then having my osteopath saying that she suspected a trapped vagus nerve. I had the eye pain, the head pain and the indescribable but undoubtedly strange feeling that something was very wrong  I actually passed out for an hour on the floor after stretching. Within minutes of being manipulated, the symptoms eased off really quickly.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, what is your opinion about POTS being related to this? There is an explosion of cases of this syndrome across the Western world, and nobody knows how to treat it. And yet, this hypothesis makes such sense, as the symptom pictures seem extraordinarily similar. I would welcome a further discussion on this. Thanks for the article.

            For many years Steven Rochlitz Phd has suggested that an irritation to the Vagus nerve caused by an undiagnosed hiatal hernia is what is making many people chronically unwell. He does not agree with the vagus nerve infection theory. You can find the info in his book Hiatal Hernia Syndrome/Vagus Nerve Imbalance

                Thank you Cort. I spoke with Dr. Rochlitz and he had a chance to clarify some things for me.
                <br/>
                Prof. Steven Rochlitz work actually makes clear that (usually hidden) porphyria [it is not a rare disease] is the ultimate cause of vagus nerve imbalancenot just the hiatal hernia syndrome. His book, PORPHYRIA: The Ultimate Cause of Common, Chronic, &amp; Environmental Illnesses cites autopsies on people unknown during their lifetimes to have had porphyria. In some cases, the vagus nerve was even found to be demyelinated.
               </p>
               <p>
                After having read Prof. Rochlitz books, Id suggest to you, to check them out or at least the one I just cited. It has many other little known factors, besides porphyria that can cause CFS or M.E. or just go to the testimonials page at his site wellatlast . com and see what many physicians and laypeople said after reading it. Be well.

              Strongly agree with this. This is it. My hypothesis is anything that causes inflammation on the vagus nerve will cause CFS. Infection, nearby infection, pinched vagus nerve. How the symptom appear  whether slowly or suddenly  is another clue that can possibly lead to the causes diagnosis.

            I am relieved to find others who are experiencing, and working on understanding, the same difficulties I am. I have been diagnosed with CFS, Fibro, Sjogrens, accompanied by IBS and a host of other alphabet soup labels.  I am so tired of being exhausted, of having painful attacks involving my heart area that suggest that my next breath will be my last. I am having an attack as I type and have nothing but Clonazepam 0.25 to manage it. I have been to the Emergency Room on numerous occasions believing that I was dying. The last time I arrived with a bp of 113/70.  I think the doc wanted to admit me to the Psych ward.  I have had a barrage of cardiac studies excluding catheterization. They found nothing.  I would need a dictionary to understand all of what you are describing about the research etc. But what I can understand in symptom descriptions says I have found the right place. I plan to watch this conversation intently. Please, if there are any known resources or specialists known in South Central Pennsylvania I would appreciate the input.

            Just adding a comment that might be useful for individuals that by whatever means have established that their CFS symptoms are due to a herpes infection of the vagus nerve.  Ive struggled for the past 15 years with periodic herpes outbreaks in my left vagus nerve system along with the usual extensive array of uncorrelated and potentially debilitating symptoms all down the interior left side of my body.  However, for myself, I have learned how to effectively manage the problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            I take a daily dose of acyclovir which Ive found minimizes the severity and frequency of the virus outbreaks.  When an outbreak does begin (they still do occur) I double acyclovir dose to two/day and add one Benadryl (diphenhydramine) tablet to each acyclovir dose.  For me the Benadryl reduces the secondary symptoms and appears to significantly enhance the effectiveness of the acyclovir.  Base on the research discussed here the antihistamine may be inhibiting the glial cell response to the virus which in turn reduces the vagus nerve illness signaling (strange symptoms) and inflammation adjacent to the nerve cells.  The reduced inflammation may then allow easier access to the interior of the cell by the acyclovir improving its effectiveness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im hoping this might help someone else who is struggling with related problems, I know it can be very difficult to deal with.  This combination/technique has definitely worked for me, is easy to follow, and it would seem that this recent research may explain why it has been effective.

            Pretty exciting. I think someones finally on the right track. Its the only thing thats made sense to me. Something that popped out at me above when speaking about Ibudilast, he mentioned it increasing the breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate that may be helping to keep your central nervous system on edge. Isnt this like the flavor enhancer Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) found in so many of our foods? I feel so much worse and nerves on edge when I consume it.

            All of this is very interesting.  When I got shingles 20 years ago, it was concentrated in the middle of my back.  A couple months ago, a blister reappeared at the old Shingles site, and now the spot is numb to the touch.  I have a family history of heart disease, Left Branch Bundle Block, and my Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction is in the mid 30s% (but clean heart arteries); and recently, when the blister reappeared, I started to have shortness of breath.  Anybody seen any research or literature that deals with the possibility of a shingles infection of the vagus nerve that could result in or exacerbate heart and breathing issues?

              I dont know but I wouldnt know.  I do know that the autonomic nervous controls some aspects of heart functioning. Can you get in touch with a dysautonomia expert? (Dysautonomia International has a list.)

            Thank you for this very interesting article on the research and I think its definitely on to something.  I had been diagnosed with CFS and other diseases including lupus and MS before a final and conclusive diagnosis and aggressive yet successful treatment of Lyme disease.  In chronic lyme, the central nervous system is infected, pretty much 90% of the time at least.  This is obviously a bacterial etiology but often viruss are confections in chronic and acute Lyme disease.  I am very skeptical of any treatment that would inhibit an immune response from the glial cells, because although it could suppress symptoms initially it could make the cause of the symptoms (cns infection) worse.  However the supposition to use antivirals is a good one.

            Tooth nerve may also count on this case. I had huge cavity on the side of my wisdom tooth which was suddenly became painful after quitting smoking. On emergency, the dentist deaden the nerve of the tooth, for further extraction. Due to several unavoidable reasons, I did not immediately extract it. 3 weeks passed by, I started getting depression and progressively become symptoms that really resembles CFS. I was getting even getting intestinal candidiasis afterwards, which its treatment only delays the extraction. Last week finally the tooth was extracted, and on the same day Ive noticed huge relieve on mood and the number of hours needed for sleeping.

            My wife got an autonomic system reboot  for her MS like symptoms.  A playlist called Jades autonomic system reboot on youtube.   She got venoplasty of the renal,  jugular and azagos veins and the idea was to shake up the vagus nerve and wake it up.  It was remarkable.  Next day her balance was fantastic,  she could pee like a horse,  first time she used the bathroom properly in years,  her right side felt normal again,  warm, not cold like a dead person. and brain fog was gone.  Remarkable thing, the vagus nerve.  I did before and after videos,  the differences are very clear.   AND she got back reflexes in the bottom of her foot. I had hoped for something but we got a miracle.   Brian

            The question if when the vagus nerve is infected, how can it become prolonged? Is the immune system having problem accessing the infected site?

            I have Extra Esophageal reflux disease due to a hiatus hernia.  It is silent reflux- no heartburn.  I have developed headaches mostly occurring at night when I lay down.  Over many years the head pain has become more frequent, now almost every night and not just night.  The internet has suggested that pooling of reflux on the vagus nerve is irritated it and causing radiating pain to the top of my head.  I have lost weight, changed what and when I eat and have recently started trying to sleep sitting up.  Might be helpingbut not there yet.   My GP said he finally believes there is a correlation between my reflux and the headaches and my specialist warned me that some of his other patients have complained of headaches which is called a complication of reflux but not sure how or why or what to do about it.  Pain killers do not touch it.  Only thing that helps is ice.   Is this really a vagas nerve complication and can it really help to sleep upright?  This blog is very interesting and potentially helpful.  Thank you.

            Hi, I know that the hypothesis suggests infection. What if broaden it to inflammation? Say, an infection that is very close in location to the vagus nerve?

               <p>
                The reason I asked is, I think I cured my 4 months of CFS by tooth extraction. Actually I never heard about CFS before, up until tooth extraction cured my unexplained fatigue along with other symptoms that Ive never felt before in my life, as a healthy 34 years old male. I was the one previously posting about tooth issue of mine relating to the fatigue, as baype.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now immediately after the extraction, I kept finding out what happened to me in the past. I can only find some post in curezone saying his root canaled tooth extraction cured his chronic fatigue. And I found this research. but I dont really understand the relation of teeth and vagus nerve at that time, until several days ago Ive found research about Toothache referred from heart disease and lung cancer via the vagus nerve. Now that really rings a bell as it suggests that vagus nerve does indeed connects to tooth.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I posted before, 3-4 weeks after the initial problem, in which my tooth pain nerve has been deadened, it started very gradually with depression. I also noticed dark circles under my eyes. It was not a sad feeling, its more like a feeling to stay at home and lots of sleep, to do nothing, and be unproductive. I didnt even cared about my previous hobby that I really liked, prior this condition. And at that time I was starting to have unrefreshing sleep 9-12 hours a day, waking up with body aches and joint stiffness. Lots of times I was chilling by 2-3 AM during sleep. I never had this and attributes it to the quitting smoking I started 4 months ago. I do remembered that the quitting had some depression symptoms during the 5-6th week. However, I vaguely remembered that depression has already subsided. But, as psychologically I dont feel Im sick, I still strongly thought it was the quitting. So I did some bout of exercises to improve my mood. It was my regular exercise since years ago, not a heavy one, and never had any effects from it. I was amazed at that time on how my mood was swinging like crazy, I was very happy and had some energy after the first exercise. However, the day after I was feeling sick and all my body aches. I think it might be because I havent exercised for some weeks. So I did the exercise again the day after, and the day afterwards. During the 3rd exercise session, I was running out of energy mid-session. I cant finish it because I dont even have the energy to move my arms, so I stopped. The day after I had a low grade fever during a walk in the mall, for like 4-5 hours in which it subsides by its own. At that point of time, I can really feel that my brain was very sensitive to stimulants, coffee, music, even carrot juice can, unreliably, lift my mood extraordinarily at times.
               </p>
               <p>
                2 weeks afterwards, there was no improvement. So in an evening, I thought I had enough, and start rolling back everything that I did since the past 6 months. I decided to quit the smoking cessation. I thought where was no point of quitting if it makes me felt like crap, but lets just limit the intake to 4-5 cigarettes a day. After the first cigarette, I found the healthy feeling I missed since months ago. However, after the second cigarette, I get heart palpitations. After 4 days of smoking, the MAOI antidepressant from cigarette kicked in. I can do all stuff, I can stay up late up till 10 PM, I can do lots stuff, my sleep time was reduced by 1-2 hours. Problem solved. However, I still have the muscle aches at times, especially when waking up in the morning. Fast forward 3 weeks, my lower abdomen got distended suddenly after skipping dinner. There was also weird sensation of numbness in the abdomen and very cold stomach. No pain, just a bit of discomfort. This is where I started going to the doctor. The first doctor misdiagnosed it and prescribing Bactrim. No effect, I thought this might be parasite so I took antiparasite. No effect. I went to internist specialists and he prescribed me prescription containing Xanax, another misdiagnosis. I was strongly insisting that this might be parasite, so he asked me to do stool test. The stool test reveals fungal spore and malabsorption, the doctor took a look at the results and paused at results for a moment, then prescribed me Diflucan. At those times I really think my brain was very slow and sluggish, as I cant even think of asking him a simple question of why did this happen? to him, I just took his prescription and left. After some browsing, I couldnt believe that this illness was something very uncommon, even considered as fake illness. But nevertheless, I took the meds. 20 hours after the first pill, my mood uplifted, I was feeling very healthy, and began to think was this colon/intestinal Candida the cause of all my previous problems. I did life as usual, though still have that unexplained fatigue, some body aches, and mood swings with stimulants.
               </p>
               <p>
                2 weeks afterwards, the long sleep had progressively went to trouble-maintaining-sleep insomnia. I would always woke up 3-4 hours after night sleep, smoking, doing something, and then resume sleeping after 30 minutes-1 hours. Total sleeping time was still around 10-11 hours, and started feeling ill again. So another elimination was done. I went to the initial dentist and she was surprised I havent took the tooth out. I was asking whether the nerve-deaden patch was causing all this, so she checked but the patch was not there. I asked whether this tooth problem can cause all these symptoms but she said she never heard of that before. There was no abscess or swelling, but the tooth does indeed hurted badly when she tapped it lightly. She said this could went to abscess anytime. So the day after, I went to my 2nd-line dentist to have it pulled. Just after the tooth was out, my mood skyrocketed and I felt very healthy. At the same day, the insomnia and fatigue was gone, my stomach gets warm, and the sleeping time I needed daily went back to 6-7 hours. This is where I started reading about CFS.
               </p>
               <p>
                That was 2 months ago and since that, no more excessive sleeping, always slept 6-7 hours a day, no more fatigue, no more body aches, and darkness/puffiness under my eyes began subsiding. Alos, 3 weeks after the extraction I tried doing the same exercise again, and surprise, my energy is already back, the exercise was nothing hard. The real chronology is more complex than this, and I am thinking of writing a blog post for my illness and how it was cured. But what happened was still puzzling me until now.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, Ive learned about CFS and found that 2 symptoms that CFS sufferers usually had was not there; headache and swollen glands. I was never having any headache whatsoever during the period. Also, no noticable swollen glands.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, can you guess which tooth was the problem?

            Hi,  just thought I would put the autonomic reboot playlist link here.  When Jade got her procedure,   recovery happened on the operating table.  She was talking so much that the nurse told her to stay quiet.  But then she had a reaction to the anesthetic and she was very sick.  I thought I had made a terrible mistake.    Then  we did her balance tests again and suddenly PERFECT!   and reflexes came back in her feet and (even though she had surgery) she was a totally  new person the next day.  It was the nearest thing to a miracle that I have ever seen.

            Hi.  I am excited about this research.  I had vagus nerve damage of unknown origin.  My cough was so severe I had to be hospitalized.  My complaints and (mis) diagnosiss are so lengthy.  I was given every RX and every wrong diagnosis for most of my life.
           </p>
           <p>
            The culprit  found many years later was due to LIVER FLUKES and SCHISTOSOMIASIS and PARASITES.  I did however test positive for E. Barr and other viruses.  There is such a huge overlap.  Visit my Facebook  Parasites in Humans
