       Robert Calvert considered himself first and foremost as a poet - with 
        or without sound/music - period. And that was despite the fact that he 
        was known throughout his life as a R`n R muscian - who did some brilliant 
        lyrics...(but hey, who cares about lyrics in rock music anyway...)
      </font>
      <p>
       <font color="FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        Calvert himself referred to this public misconception from time to time 
          - as you can see on the
        <a href="../quotes/calvertquotes.htm" target="_blank">
         QUOTES
        </a>
        pages - where you will also find more infos on several of the works 
          that appear on the following pages.
        <br/>
        Quite in accordance to the strange fate of his career, even more of 
          his literary and theatrical plans were dropped or left behind unfinished 
          than other of his projects in the music area.

        it's of course hard to draw a distinctive line between these territories. 
          This process started very early on, when Calvert became
        <a href="../hawkwind/calhw.htm" target="_blank">
         Hawkwind's
        </a>
        'resident poet' in the early 70's, reciting his poetry to the band's 
          sound-collages - some of these poems also appeared later in his first 
          collection of poetry entitled
        <a href="../works/calvertworks3.htm#centi" target="_blank">
         Centigrade

        This page of the WORDS section is presenting the published works of 
          Calvert - which is mostly poetry - prose, apart from the only published 
          novel
        <a href="../works/calvertworks4.htm#hypebook" target="_blank">
         HYPE
        </a>
        , 
          seems to have been a minor field in Calvert's literary activities.
        <br/>
        The poems - apart from the one's performed with Hawkwind - were taken 
          from the two publications
        <a href="#centigrade">
         CENTIGRADE 232
        </a>
        (1977) 
          and
        <a href="#earthritual">
         THE EARTH RITUAL
        </a>
        (1986).
        <br/>
        Other poems, unpublished or published in very rare and now unavailable 
          magazines can be found
        <a href="unreleasedpoems.htm" target="_blank">

        After Calvert's departure from Hawkwind in `78 Calvert conceived various 
          shows that consisted of a mixture of sketches, stand-up-comedy, recitations 
          of his poetry and songs from his solo-albums &amp; recordings with Hawkwind 
          - exploring how far he can take the audience in this unusual but always 
          witty and inspired mix of contemporary poetry- and rock entertainment. 
          A selection of those texts can be found

         When the stillness
Of the beginning
Was shattered
By the word
A fragment of it
Fell to the earth.

It tried to make
A home for itself
But could find
No resting place
For long. It stumbled
At the roots

Of a liars tongue
But was soon
Spat out. It lived
For an instant
In a murderer`s hand.
It lingered

At the fingertips
Of a thief.
For a time it hung
At the edge of war
By clinging
To a shrug of peace

Which soon gave way.
A politician juggled it
So much in his speech
That if fell, almost
Senseless to the ground.
Later a small boy

Who was about
To stamp on an ant
Got it stuck
To his shoe and had
A moments trouble
In shaking it free.

         1.
Outstretched like this the palm
Does not give much away
To one unversed in palmistry.
It could just as easily
Slap a face as receive a gift.

It was a hand, much the same
As this, that spun the first wheel.

2.
Solid, compact, as good
For propping
As for uppercutting chins:
It was a fist, similar to this,
That upheld the first thinker's head.

3.
This opposing tackle is the secret
Of the hand, its key. That makes
It possible to grip. Depress
A hypdermic's valve.
Hitch a lift. Flick pages.
Signify that all is well.

It was a thumb like this
Sent Christians to the lions.

4.
This index could be pointing
To your guilt, or the way
To the public lavatories.
A finger such as this
Could pull a trigger
Or pick a nose.

5.
For a creature that only has one head
One pair of hands seems quite enough.

         Seeing that I still had eight more stops
To go, and already read
The maps and advertisements from end to end,
And studied my own double-
Eyed, four-eye-browed freak
Of a reflected face for far too long; I took
To noticing another. Through a kind

Of snooker-shot of glances
Aimed against the glass, I could see her
Staring; but could not be sure
If it was at me. I smiled,
And saw her turn to speak
To someone next to her. I also turned:
And unexpectedly our eyes engaged

For just the instant that it takes for looks
To rocket through the tunnels
Of an unguarded gaze, and arrive
At the real self. Badly shaken
With embarrasment, we both looked back
At our images: safely imprisoned
In the hurtling stillness of the glass.

         The moon blacked out; a perfect night. A flight of Wellington set course
         <br/>
         For Bremen. Two uniforms
         <br/>
         Were discarded in a hotel room.

         On one side she lay reading

         Mars was in ascendance.

         His hand reached for the switch

         And plunged the room into falling dark.
         <br/>
         The bomb doors opened.

         The child-making moment flared:
         <br/>
         And buildings smouldered.

         <br/>
         Who was moved by music
         <br/>
         To much of an extent.

         <br/>

         <br/>
         On trades of ink into maps,

         At the edge of my sight.

         She casts her eyes,
like pebbles,
into the pool
of the mirror's stillness

and stares and stares

at the rippling image
until her gazing trails
like a net
to haul the illusion

of her looks. She looks

out of the mirror
at herself looking in.
And catches little wriggling smiles
then releases them

         Where he'd got it I didn't ask,
I was so knocked-out to see it:
Double-barrelled, loaded with risk;
A real shot-gun. 'Shall we try it?'

Humpo said, his screwed-up lenses
X-raying me for cowardice.
Humpo lived for taking chances.
Keep away, was my mum's advice.

I followed him to Romney marsh.
The gun was in a fishing-case
Tied to his cross-bar. 'What's the rush?'
I yelled, legs aching, 'S'not a race'.

We hid our bikes in leaves and went
On foot till we found a clearing.
'Bet you've never been on a hunt,'
He said, in his voice for lying.

I watched him open up the case
The same cold way he gutted fish,
Or fingered girls. He held the prize
Of dented metal threat to flesh.

I looked after the cartridges,
While he broke the barrel to load.
Thick sedge thrived along the edges
Of the lake. And the birds sang loud.

Then, without warning, Humpo fired
Both barrels off. 'C'mon, let's get!'
I croaked in panic. 'No-one heard',
Said Hump, 'don't be such a pratt'.

He froze, one finger raised for hush,
Tilted eyes gone strangely vacant:
A snap-shot trapped by Agfaflash.
'Hear the birds?' he whispered; 'I can't'.

And now the air is teeming
With these Arctic spores. They waste

No time. By early morning
They'll have grown a new world
To explore. Craterless, still gleaming

From creation's mint. An undefiled
Planet: Until the houses loom
Like some invading fleet of brick-walled

Space-craft, come to stake its claim.

         I'd rather the fire-storm of atmospheres
Than this cruel descent from a hundred years
Of dream, into the starkness of the capsule.
Two of our crew still lay suspended, cool
In their tombs of sleep. The nagging choirs
Of memory, the lenghts of tube, and wires
Worming from their flesh to machinery
I would have to cut. Such midwifery
Is just one function of the leader here:
Floating in a sac of fluid dark, a clear
Century of space away from Earth.
One man stared from the trauma of this birth
Attentive to the tapes asssuring him
This was reality, however grim:
Our journey's end. The landing itself
Was nothing. We just touched upon a shelf
Of rock selected by the Automind.
And left a galaxy of dreams behind.....

         Full waking took us days to realize.
Adjusting to the newness of our eyes
We stayed inside, performing simple tasks.
Hardly speaking, faces set like masks.
Until the time came round for us to set
The first feet on this world, to get
Our samples and erect all the instruments.
A barren planet, but to all intents
Another Eden opening its gates
For this chosen few who'd outslept their fates.
Anonymous, identical, in our suits
We entered the air-lock. My weighted boots
Would be the first to touch this unknown stone.
I led some distance, then I felt alone.
So I turned. And saw that the others were
Standing still. I radioed to make them stir.
But got no answer. So I waved my arm.
But they still stood as though a stoning charm
Had taken hold. I made my slow way back
And found each man had frozen in his track.
I hammered my gloved fist on visor-plate.
And pulled at pressure-padded arms. A state
Of utter trance had overtaken all my men.

My mouth felt dry. My fingers stiff. And then....

         I would have liked you
to have been deep-
Frozen too, and waiting
Still as fresh in your flesh
For my return.
But your father refused
To sign the forms
To freeze you.
Let's see you'd be, what,
About sixty now. And long
Dead by the time I get
Back to Earth. My time-
Suspended dreams were full
Of you as you were when I left.
Still under age.
Your android replica
Is playing up again.

She moans

I give my thanks whole-heartedly, for life.
For this vermillion tapestry, warp and weft
Of the blood vein's fabric. It's threads are rife,
Conspicuous; easy-meat for knife
Or microbe and the many ills that kill.
And yet stubborn and abundant still.

With ruins of ages around me, strewn
Like wreckage of an unsuccessful probe
Among the craters of a wasted moon,
I extend my thanks for this living robe
And its pulsing weave, to the moth-holed globe,
And unravelling, almost threadbare sky
Of the failing sun under which I lie.

        No, I will not think of you
Laid out under lamps: the glare
Of eyes, above white bandit-
Masks, all trained on you; your flesh
Cut back and held by clamps, while
Instruments investigate;

Your pale, blue-veined breasts both touched
With expert vermillion
Openings, like two lip-sticked
Mouths, smiling, one on either
Side, a vision of Magritte's.
I will think of something else

And smoke a continuous
Cigarette. I will only
Think of the surgeon's pencil-
Marks, you wore the night before,
As a fading endorsement.
For readmission to some

Orgy, a eunuch doorman
Applied to your breasts as you
Stepped outside to take the air.
I refuse to think of you
Asleep beneath the breathing -
Mask of a black Ganesha:

Your trunk sucking oxygen;
Your eyes gone in; under more
Dazzle than this scarred page's
Angle-poise. I will not mourn
Your imagined death, for the taste
Of tears. I will only think

Of the morning, when I'll come
With grapes and flowers to rouse
You from your anaesthetic
Shell; to unwrap and open
The shy kiss I shall give you;
When you lie in albumen-

Coloured sheets: As exquisite
As though you were newly hatched

         There is nothing more obstinate than this
Primadonna of precision pens.
Neglect it for a while and it will hiss
at your attempt to make amends

By scratching at the page without a sign
Of the eloquent arias of its line.

Take it to the nearest sink, unscrew,
and let its pent-up blackness flood:
A sudden massing of all you drew;
A burst of murdered dragon's blood.

Watch, as it merges with the water: plumes
Of squid's secretion; of octopus fumes.

In a while of soaking, the hollow nib
Should free itself of clotted ink.
And reassambled, be just as glib.
And nimble as the speed you think.

It took me less than a minute-and-a-half
To write this, with my Rapidograph.

         From nine in the morning
Until five in the evening
He worked in the office:
Sat at a desk with a telephone,
A typewriter, and a bottle of pills.
When the telephone rang
It meant that he had
To pick up the receiver and say hello.
When the typewriter rang
It meant that he had to shift
It's carriage from the left to the right
When his head rang
It meant that he had to take a pill.

One day he found
That owing to a fault
In the ventilation system
The only intake of air
For the whole department
Was through a hole in his desk.
He toyed with this for a while,
Placing his Roget's Thesaurus over the hole,
Observing, with pleasure,
The effects of air-withdrawal
On the rest of the staff.
(Their faces turning faintly blue).

And not being one to miss a trick
Next morning he turned up for work
With a wad of chewing gum
And an aqualung in his briefcase.

         Whatever you do, don't
mention politics,

Show them how
you can twitch
your jowels.
Make a V sign

They sat and listened
to the tapes
in the A &amp; R department's
quadrophonic office.
No-one looked at anyone. They tapped
their feet, and watched
the spools of the Revox
turn.

I like that track
about fighting
on the beaches,
said the man
from promotion.
Reminds me of Blood,
Sweat, and Tears.
I think we should
have a lyric sheet.

He did the cover
design himself,
his manager said.
It's a landscape
in Morocco....

Ah.

Well, we'd rather
have a photograph
of him in the homburg
and crombie, with a big
cigar. That's the image
We're going for.

O.K.? O.K.
O.K?

O.K.

And we'd like to put:
Never Before in the Field
of Human Conflict
out as a single,
if you'll do
the remix we suggest.

Right.

Right?

Right.

Then why don't we
go down to the rail-
way carriage
and sign
the contract?

It's a pleasure to do
business with you
Mr. Hitler.

         On a hard night of rain the road was full
Of glaring eyes alive in the headlights.
I thought of demons as I slowed.
Winding the window down, I saw them all
Blindly staring; rows of frogs with their throats
Fizzling song. The green digits glowed
Like ghosts on the dashboard; the cassette played

A Bartok string quartet. I turned it down
And heard the rain`s deep drum on the bonnet.
The wipers were on slow and ticked
Like an instrument payload on the moon.
These bags of bone are scaled lemmings, when it
Rains like this you find they have treked
Into the headlights tunnel and are blocked

Up inside their falling walls of brightness.
Not long before they were pupils gazing
From the complex vision of spawn -
Now, in all this dark and rain, they are eyes
Again: targets threaded out on a string
To face a double - barelled dawn.
I wondered how many my wheels had mown

As I got out of the car, taking care
Not to tread on any of these soft buddhas.
I herded them back to the mud -
To who on earth knows what jaws lurking there,
Then, with the feeling perhaps a god has,
Knowing his motives to be good,
I got back in the car and hit the road.

         Dusk, and a worm with a wound
In its side had fetched
Up out of the earth to die
On the altar of a crazy-
Paving stone; a sacrifice
To the trodden sun.
The forsythia shifts its druid
Robe of leaves, breathing
A mystique of green.

The wound is a bulge
Of pink, like a blood-
Shot eye: like a perished
Inner tube peering through
A buckled wheel`s rip. It is
The budding sphere of a new sun
That these curling agonies
Of contraction are
Labouring to give birth to.

Beginning with this runic U
It will, in time, spell out
Whole alphabets of writhing
Calligraphy for rescue to
The indifferent sky - as it pumps
Itself in all directions
Away from the suction
Of the hole. The loam
Brown business end, coiled

To a point in its silver
Wire, would seem to be
Wriggling towards independence
Like a spiral on metal
Shaved from a lathe. I lifted
This whole kinked and twitching
H.G. Wells monstrosity
Back of the Beowulf blades
Of the earth, and left

It to its long untying
Of the knots of the air.
Meanwhile, the spiders continued
To submit their latest designs
For the wheel, or filaments
For an everlasting sun -
Until it grew too dark
To lip-read anymore, these swollen
Ulcered mouthing of soil.

         He was so dozy he`d never
Recognize the neat backs
Of heads he`d trimmed once a fortneight,
Let alone the same red faces
That exchanged bursting looks
From out of the mirrors in front
Of his chair; so we`d follow him
When he was on his bike,
With its Victorian adverts
For The End of the World
And hurl our insults. "Holy Joe!
Holy Joe!" was, usually, enough.

He`d thrust his prophet`s beard at us,
His patched trousers flapping
Out from his cycle-clips, his eyes
Blinking like scissors - and dismount,
One daring aboy would dash
Behind and pull the handle bars;
Crashing the bike onto its side.
We`d aim our kicks and run
Before he had time to straighten
Himself into a threat:
"Holy Joe! Holy Joe!! But when
Our haircut time came round we`d sit

Head bowed, in the chair while he preached
And snipped for a shilling
A throw. (Our mums would always carp
About the five bob we needed
Now the price of haircuts
Had gone up again); but we went,
Cold-necked, to the fish shop, itchy-
Backed, with our exorted
Change; and later smoked our Woodbines
With vinegary fingers:
No longer sure how close
The end of the world was at hand.

         The pose they hold is the pose
Of the robot: arms bent down
And elbows out; trailing those
Wires that could fry a town -
With their x-rays of a frown
They frighten away the crows.

In skeletal regiments
Along green fields they link
Cat`s-cradles of filaments,
Draw, with inedible ink,
A map of how robots think:
In straight lines, with no nonsense.

All across the changing sky
Stretch electric washing lines
Where the clouds ar ehung to dry -
Passing closed down mills and mines
On their way to neon signs,
Humming, humming merrily.

        For changes in the earth.

        The new style jester has no need to dress
        <br/>
        In ridiculous knickerbockers and bells
        <br/>
        To make us laugh at our own distress:

        He stands there in a suit that tells
        <br/>
        Us nothing of his power to make
        <br/>
        Us roar and roll about and break
        <br/>
        Loose from our formalizing cells.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        He opens fire with his high speed patter
        <br/>

        <br/>
        Making fun of all the things that matter -
        <br/>
        Nothing is sacred: The Church; The Queen.
        <br/>
        And while you`re laughing he can't go wrong,
        <br/>
        He quickly runs you through with a song
        <br/>
        As cold as the singer he might have been.

        You can spot the joker in any pack

        <br/>
        As though to make up for some lack
        <br/>
        He finds in others, or himself; stays cool
        <br/>
        While they crease up, and seldom sings:
        <br/>
        Quite satisfied to pull the strings
        <br/>
        That lead from the punch-line of a crack.

         I would see the city as a mutant among the wonders of the world.
         <br/>
         It's chimneys polluting the air.
         <br/>
         Its roots poisoning the earth.
         <br/>
         It's tentacles setting one man against another
         <br/>
         and strangling them both in their hopeless contest.

         I would map the cities' highways and tunnels and bridges,
         <br/>
         its subways and canals, its neighbourhoods adorned by beautiful homes
         <br/>
         filled with priceless objects, rare libraries, and fine rooms.

         Its clever networks of pipes and cables and wires under the streets.
         <br/>
         Its Police departments and communication stations.
         <br/>
         Its hospitals, churches, and temples.
         <br/>
         Its administrative buildings crowded with overworked computers,
         <br/>
         telephones, and servile clerks.

         Then I would wage war against this city as if it were a living body. 
          I would welcome the night - sister of my skin, cousin of my shadow, 
          and have her shelter me and help me in my battle.

         and then I would run away and hide, waiting for the thunder which would 
          trap, in mute telephone wires,
         <br/>
         millions of unheard words.
         <br/>
         Which would darken rooms full of white light and fearful people.

         and I would hold my knife against the back of a doorman,
         <br/>
         yawning in his gold braided uniform, and force him to lead me upstairs
         <br/>
         where I would plunge my knife into his body.

         I would visit the rich, and the comfortable, and the un-aware,

         and their last screams would suffocate in their ornate curtains,
         <br/>
         or tapestries and priceless carpets.
         <br/>
         Their dead bodies pinned down by broken statues
         <br/>
         would be gazed upon by slashed family portraits.

        Then I would run to the highways and speedways that surge forward towards 
          the city.
        <br/>
        I would have with me bags full of bent nails to empty on the asphalt.
        <br/>
        I would wait for the dawn to see cars, trucks, buses
        <br/>
        approaching at great speed and hear the bursting of their tyres,
        <br/>
        the screech of their wheels, the thunder of their steel bodies
        <br/>
        suddenly growing weak as they crash into each other,
        <br/>
        like wine glasses pushed off a table.
