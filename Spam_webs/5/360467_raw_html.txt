    The Impressionists' radical experiments with atmospheric
effects, optical relationships between color and light, and brighter palettes
greatly influenced a generation of American artists, who absorbed these
new approaches to painting, and applied them successfully to American landscapes
and portraiture.

    This exhibition introduces stellar examples of the work
of important American Impressionist painters, and encompasses a broad range
of subject matter and technical developments which motivated these artists
to depart from their studios and paint in plein air. At the same time,
studio portraits, elegant figure studies, and still life paintings reveal
the virtuosity of American painters of the time, through widely divergent
techniques.

    At the end of the nineteenth century, many American artists
retreated from the realities of the early modern era-with its burgeoning
industry and crowded cities-and envisioned instead an American Eden.  They
painted tranquil landscapes and dreamy portraits of women, aiming to fulfill
the widely held belief that art should delight the senses and elevate the
spirit.  In 1922, when the Akron Art Institute (now the Akron Art Museum)
was founded, these were the artistic subjects collected by the city's elite.
 Akron was the center of a booming U.S. rubber industry, and while rubber
company executives embraced cutting-edge technology and urban living, they
also sought to uphold America's cultural history.  They collected and then
donated to the museum the exquisite turn-of-the-century landscapes, figure
studies and still lifes in this exhibition.  These patrons understood that
the paintings' lyrical expressions of beauty and refinement would provide
pleasure to visitors through the industrial age and beyond.

    Despite their nation's growing political and industrial
power, American artists and collectors at the turn of the last century believed
Europe to be the standard of cultural achievement.  Nearly every artist
featured in this exhibition traveled to Europe for instruction and inspiration,
although they occasionally had difficulty finding the latter.  In 1877,
artist Julian Alden Weir described an exhibition of impressionist paintings
he viewed in Paris as "worse than a Chamber of Horrors."  French
impressionists such as Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir often worked with
high-keyed colors and forceful brushstrokes that drew their works toward
abstraction, an effect that American painters studying in France found unsettling.
 The small brushstrokes, delicate colors and crisp forms in Weir's
    <i>
     White
Oaks
    </i>
    reflect the tidier version of the impressionist technique that
American painters developed and brought back home.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    American artists most often used impressionism to convey
the pastoral beauty of the rural landscape.  In
    <i>
     Bedford Hills
    </i>
    , Childe
Hassam used diagonal strokes of green, blue and yellow paint to capture
the play of sun and wind over a lush field in upstate New York.  Willard
Metcalf combined cool colors with small, spiky brushstrokes to communicate
the sensation of chilly spring air in
    <i>
     Maytime
    </i>
    , a view of Leete's
Island, Connecticut.  These two artists and many others formed vibrant summer
art colonies throughout New England and exhibited their successful results
in cities such as Boston and New York.  Six artists represented in this
exhibition-Weir, Hassam, Metcalf, John Twachtman, William Merritt Chase
and Thomas Wilmer Dewing-also exhibited together as part of a group called
the Ten American Painters, which was dedicated to promoting newer styles
such as impressionism.  American impressionist works appealed greatly to
urban-based collectors who saw in them evidence of the restorative power
of nature.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Other American landscapists sought instead to express mood
and subjective feelings through their images.  Drawing inspiration from
the Barbizon painters, a group of French artists who lived and worked in
a rural community outside of Paris, the Americans developed a "tonalist"
technique.  The method is characterized by simplified compositions, blurred
forms and a limited range of colors.  In
    <i>
     The New Moon
    </i>
    , Dwight W.
Tryon combined a glowing twilight sky with an archway of lacy trees to evoke
feelings of reverie.  The woman and child standing in a forest clearing
in George Inness'
    <i>
     Late Afternoon, October
    </i>
    are shrouded by the greenish
haze that envelopes the scene.  By merging figures with the landscape, tonalists
expressed their belief in humankind's essential spiritual connection with
nature, an idea introduced into American culture in the nineteenth century
by authors/naturalists Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  Tonalist
artists were never organized as a formal group, but most who painted in
the style knew one another and shared similar points of view.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Nature was not the only source of pleasure and inspiration
for artists of this period.  Many found in the female figure an ideal emblem
of enlightenment and beauty.  Impressionist painter Frederick Frieseke summered
in Giverny, France, where Monet lived, and specialized in depicting figures
bathed in sunlight.  Frieseke's exquisite
    <i>
     On the Balcony
    </i>
    and many
other works in this exhibition were donated to the museum by Edwin C. Shaw,
an executive with the B.F. Goodrich Tire and Rubber Company and a founder
of the Akron Art Institute.

    William Merritt Chase is best known for his society portraits
of women rendered with bravura brushwork and deep, rich colors.  His courtly
    <i>
     Girl in White
    </i>
    , a portrait of Florence Irene Dimock (the daughter
of a Connecticut-based silk merchant), is reminiscent of the baroque-era
European paintings Chase saw while studying at the Royal Academy in Munich,
Germany.  Cincinnati native Frank Duveneck also studied in Munich.  The
meticulous brushstrokes and icy colors in his portrait of his sister, Molly,
are representative of the classical style he developed later in his career.
 Paintings by Thomas Wilmer Dewing reveal his distinctive and sophisticated
vision of women.  Confined in spare interiors or moving through vaporous
landscapes, Dewing's ethereal figures suggest feelings of loss and longing.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    The melancholy mood of Dewing's paintings signals a vital
change that took place in American culture in the decades following the
Civil War (1861-1865).  In this time of lost innocence, many artists did
not feel compelled to create detailed landscapes celebrating the splendor
of American scenery or narrative images centering on daily life.  Instead,
they adapted traditional symbols of transformation or death.  Ralph Blakelock's
moody nocturnes (compositions evoking the dreamlike qualities of night)
and the wilting flowers in Emil Carlsen's spare
    <i>
     Rhages Jar
    </i>
    hint at
the inevitable transition from this earthly realm to another.  Elihu Vedder's
enigmatic
    <i>
     Sleeping Girl
    </i>
    extends from the tradition within nineteenth-century
romantic literature and painting that linked sleep with death.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Beginning in the 1910s, some American artists found their
country's bustling cities and expanding industrial landscapes to be compelling
subjects for art.  Others embraced vigorous new European styles such as
Dada, Cubism and Expressionism.  The generation of artists represented in
this exhibition felt anxious about these radical changes and resisted them.
 Their poetic works represent an idealized vision of the world; a locale
as enchanting today as it was a century ago.
