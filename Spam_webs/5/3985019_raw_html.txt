         Announcer: Welcome to the official podcast at ContentChampion.com. Join our heroic quest to discover truly epic content marketing. Introducing your host, the Content Champion himself, Loz James.
        </p>
        <p>

Im delighted Jeffs come on this show as I genuinely love his blog and regularly share his excellent posts with my audience.

Jeffs blog gets millions of visitors a year, so if theres one man who knows how to drive high volumes of traffic to your online business its him. Lets dive in.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thanks very much for coming on today, Jeff.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Its a pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Youre an expert, a renowned social media digital marketing and content marketing expert and I know my listeners are keen to hear your thoughts on how to drive increased levels of traffic to their blogs and websites.
        </p>
        <p>
         My audience would also love to hear your backstory too, so before we kick off can you share with us how you got started in the marketing industry?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Ive been in tech for about 20 years, I suppose, and I ran my business doing communications, so theres sales and marketing there. I was in business development for some of the big telcos in the internet industry when it kicked off in the mid-90s. Took a bit of a seachange change and then came back into the web world and then kicked off the blog.
        </p>
        <p>
         My background before that was a teacher, but technology, marketing has intrigued me for more than a couple of decades now. When social media turned up it fascinated me because it basically combined technology and humanity. I sort of felt its power as a marketing tool and said Ive just got to check this out a little bit more. Thats when I started the blog.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Ok
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I was unemployed, middle of a marriage breakup, had to close a business and I was $50,000 in debt to credit cards. I had a bit of time so I started reading a lot online and I read David Meermans book The New Rules of Marketing PR and then I read Tim Ferriss lifestyle book, The 4-Hour Workweek, which talked about how to create a life online, or business and life and a lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then I read a HubSpot blog, it was, that said if youve got an inkling of what you want to blog about, just start, so I did. Just started writing about social media. I had no grand plan, spent all of $10 on a domain name, and that was it really. Set up a WordPress.com blog and started writing. It was just from a, I suppose, a fascination and a curiosity driven by online research and reading. I love reading.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Now youve been published all over the place. New York Times, Huffington Post, youre on the Forbes list of Top 50 Social Media Power Influences. Its a real success story, isnt it? You must be really proud of what youve achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Yeah, its a little bit bizarre in one sense. I suppose people seemed to resonate with what I was writing. Ive gone back to some of my original blog posts and they were very poorly written, I can say, and very poorly structured. Its been a lot of learning along the way. It still surprises me. It really does. Its driven from, I think, what I love doing and what Im passionate about and also some of my strengths, I think.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its the intersection of a variety of interests and passions. I think thats the secret behind success in any type of pursuit. Its got to be what youre good at and also what youre passionate about and quite often theyre the same things, because whatever you find easy to do flows. It turns work into play.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: With such an in-depth level of knowledge, I know my listeners will be interested to get your thoughts on how to drive traffic. If I am a small business owner listening to this and I want to get more traffic, Im perhaps a blogger without any readers, where should I start with this whole process? Where should we begin?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I found Twitter to be a great driver of traffic, so from day one, well within a few weeks, I actually realized that I started building my Twitter followers. I worked very hard and relentlessly on that. Twitters a great way of actually building a targeted audience so I pursued some really specific tactics on that. I made a lot of mistakes early on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also I use email as well so I continue to build an email list. I didnt do that very well at the beginning. In fact, I didnt do it for about 12 months because I really wasnt chasing traffic, I was just writing because I found it interesting. My advice would be actually dont just rely on social media. Build an email list from day one. Thats really important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also the other thing too is to optimize your blog for search engines. Youre not going to attract search engines very much in the early stage, but youve got to keep doing it and over time to earn the authority online that you start ranking in search engines and hopefully get to page one for key terms and phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: That dovetails into my next question actually. How long did it take you? Did you have 100 posts on the site? What sort of happened in that organic traffic process?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: The organic happened maybe six months in when I got nominated by some of my readers to the first Social Media Examiner Top 10 Social Media Blogs. I was one of the ones that was actually selected but didnt appear on the list finalists.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its like your peers that were reading your, readers reading your blog and they actually put me forward and that gave me some what I call social proof and some visibility on another blog that grew quite rapidly. That was about six months in. It wasnt so much the number of posts.
        </p>
        <p>
         You reach certain tipping points but it has to come from persistent consistent effort. I think when I kicked off I did two or three maybe couple posts a week and then I put it up to three and then I said, If Im going to be serious about this  When I started getting some feedback that it was working, I then bumped it up to five posts a week, which is pretty well what I do mostly now.
        </p>
        <p>
         You just got to create the best content you can and build the largest tribes and followers on social media that you can. Thats basically a crowdsource market and they do the sharing for free, so if you create great content then people are going to share it because it adds value to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Whats the balance now? You have some guests posting, you do obviously a lot of the writing yourself. What sort of length youre writing, does that play into it as well?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Yeah, I try and aim around 1000 words because if you do something thats fairly deep and gives what I call very good tips, that makes sense, that are well-structured, then you become a resource and that means that people are going to link to you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Basically by creating big, fairly substantial blog posts rather than just small, fluffy ones, youre actually becoming the resource or the go-to place for people to actually get their information. Its really important.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mix on guests to my writing is maybe 60% guests and about 40% my writing because Im developing some other premium content on my online courses, basically outlining a new book, and developing affiliate income off the blog as well. Theres a lot to do and always will be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Guest authors  They always say give a little bit of a range of topics and also different insights I think people appreciate. Because sometimes when youre writing yourself day in, day out you start to feel like youre writing this  Its Groundhog Day, sometimes it feels like, because youre actually  I think Ive written this before, maybe four or five times but in different ways.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think its good to add some guest authors to blogs because it gives that different approach that I think adds a freshness and also its great to give some other people attention online because people do guest blog and you actually give them an audience and its fun to see them get a kick out of it as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: You mentioned persistence and consistency. I spoke to some high-profile bloggers that say, I do one 4000 word post a month and then I promote it all month, and Ive spoken to many more others actually since Hummingbird and everything else where theyre saying, No, its consistency. Now the fresh content is rewarded ultimately in the search engines. Obviously thats what youre doing so thats a good strategy really for small business owners to follow from the off.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Yes, because Googles rewarding authority, like I said, fresh content. Fresh and unique content. They see the activities happening and you think about it, Googles trying to serve up relevant content thats actually fresh. Google and its algorithm will mark down older content, so youve got to be constantly refreshing your blog.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes you can do it once a month, sure you can write a long one, but it basically, thats telling Google, Theres not much happening here. The reality is that social search and content is very much a synergy. Youve got to be making sure that you are distributing content, writing it constantly, so you can actually get the best search engine results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Okay, lets say Im a small business just down the road from me here in rural Essex in England in the UK and I want to start blogging. Im looking at promotion as well, perhaps on social media. I should start a WordPress blog, I should then perhaps go onto Twitter if thats the most appropriate place for my audience, but looking at some strategies for growing your Twitter following, how would we go about doing that?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I use a few tools. One I found very useful is the premium version of Tweepi. T-W-double E-P-I. It allows me to follow the followers of people within my industry, so other top bloggers in social media, I can go and follow their followers because thats a qualified list.
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally the people that are following social media or Examiner, theyre following them because its about social media. If I follow their followers, they notice that Im following them, theyll go and check my blog out and going, Jeffs following me. His content looks good, great, or fantastic, whatever they think. Theyll go, Jeffs worth following, so actually theyll follow you back.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is a very simple way of basically building following and is targeted. Earlier on I just followed anyone that had a big number of Twitter followers. That wasnt very clever but you have to do it alone. That tactic with Tweepi I found it worked really, really well. Because youll find that if youre creating great content, you followed people, and youve got a good profile and youre starting to build some social proof 
        </p>
        <p>
         Its harder earlier on, of course, because you dont have that authority and dont have that content depth and maybe dont have that social proof in terms of the number of Twitter followers and retweets on your blog and so on. That tactic following qualified list and building my Twitter following that way has continued to work for me for the last four or five years.
        </p>
        <p>
         You just cant do that on Facebook and you cant do that on LinkedIn. Well, you can do it on LinkedIn but its much harder to do. Tweepi is a very efficient tool. Creates a list that actually can follow people quite quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Obviously we cant lump all the social media platforms in together because they have different uses for different audiences 
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: You mentioned a couple of others there. What do you think of Google+?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Google+ Ive been on pretty well from day on. Its got a lot of really cool features like Hangouts and then its also got Circles and all those sorts of things. The demographic tends to be mild and a bit more technical and geeky.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its, I suppose, a little bit like Twitter on steroids in one sense being said about it, but I dont know if thats actually correct. The profile of Google+ is different to the others. I havent found it drives a lot of traffic. Its harder to build a following on it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think youve got to be there because it does lend some level of SEO, but how much, Im not sure because obviously Googles not going to tell you that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I find its maybe about the fourth or fifth, somewhat sixth driver of traffic for my blog, so I havent devoted a lot of time to it in terms of achieving my goals, but I do publish my blog post to it after every time I hit publish. Its certainly worth participating in and trialing, but I found that its not a big driver of traffic. StumbleUpon can be more than Google+.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: The advice would be then coming from that is that yeah, be across the different social media channels, the main ones, but using the follow the followers if you like strategy, youll find out where people are active within your target audience and then just hit on that particular social media platform, whichever one it is, and then youll build up your profile on there and itll drive you some traffic?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Yeah, I find, for example, Twitters maybe not the perfect place necessarily for me to be in one sense for some of the business I do, but it does create a lot of brand awareness that goes back into the other platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes you dont know what activity on one platform, how itll impact another. Its different for everyone else and a lot of people are comfortable  Some people love doing video blogs so that might be a different way to use that to build traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Youre going to find where you want to play that youre comfortable with and I love the simplicity of Twitter as well. It basically hasnt changed a lot. Yes, its got more visual and so on, but its still very much the tool I really got to enjoy five, six years ago, whereas Facebooks just this constant change and how you work with it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Facebooks reducing its organic reach which means you have to play it in a different way and then quite often need to pay for attention. That can be very effective and you can actually do quite well with good, paid advertising on Facebook because of its targeting qualities, but organic reach thats around the 4% mark makes it hard to actually reach people through earned tactics rather than paying for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: For sure. In the mix of traffic strategies youve mentioned on-page SEO optimizing your posts for the search engines. Weve got to be careful about link building though these days. Do you do much of that? I guess you dont need to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I have never done or chased link building as a tactic. What I would recommend is if you create the best content you can and also long-form contents really important because that means as a resource, people are wanting to link to you because they want to reference you and want to keep it as a resource when they write a blog post saying, Check this out. Heres 20 tips on how to do Twitter marketing, or whatever. If youre creating great content, youll actually naturally grow organic inbound links.
        </p>
        <p>
         Guest blogging is another way of doing that and Googles made some noises about theyre going to try and stop guest blogging but its going to be very hard for them to detect, I think, what are people doing specific tactics that are link building through guest blogging.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you create great content and you are able to get out there on your channels, social media or email, you will actually naturally build SEO over time. Thats what Google actually rewards is that natural, organic high-value content that people want to share.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Really, again, coming from that, if Im sitting down with a small business owner or client and they say, How does this blogging stuff work? I should really be saying, If you can, if you do have the resources to do 1000 word plus well researched piece of content and publish it to your blog every day and share that on social media, within six months youll be going great guns with that?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Youre going to give yourself a pretty good shot, yeah, especially if youve done some key word research as well. Maybe with an SEO expert or depending on how much research you want to do yourself, go to a list of 50 keyword phrases that are important for people finding you online in your industry and what they use to search to find you or research.
        </p>
        <p>
         It might be very hard for a business to do 1000 words a day. I get up early, so typically 4:30, 5:00 most days to do the guest posts and then work during the day. Some people arent going to be very good writers. They might have to outsource it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Try and be consistent. Do one a week. It really comes down to what theyre going to be able to do internally and what they can pay for externally. It really comes down to not everyone can do 1000 words a day. Thats just not going to be almost realistic. Youve got to be realistic, some are going to embrace it and run with it. Others will decide its just too much hard work and just wont do it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Heres a fact now that the more quality content that goes on there the better youre going to do, isnt it? Ive had people asking me myself if you do consistent content, Im doing it and its not working, but there is a critical mass you can reach. I find that fascinating now that if you do blog every day, you are going to get more traffic, arent you?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Oh, absolutely. I do say to clients saying, Dont expect this to be a shortcut measure, but when it starts kicking in youre going to be surprised. Expect itll take six to 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         Basically you might have to work at it for six months without seeing much reward, but once you build so much what I call a digital asset, this content and search engine starting to rank you, because then what happens is you start getting more and more traffic organically, you start turning out more, and then that builds on that so it actually accelerates.
        </p>
        <p>
         The long term benefits are, as you continue to create content, as you continue to be found without having to pay for attention online, thats whats really, really important and thats that earned piece in content marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Its good that you said that because that does lead neatly into the next question. Youve mentioned Facebook paid advertising. What role does paid traffic, paid advertising play, AdWords and everything in the traffic generation equation?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I dont do any for my blog. I really dont need to because I worked so hard on the earned part, but I think if youre kicking off a website or a blog and you need to not only commit resources and money to designing it or building it, you also to commit to some resources to actually kick it off with some paid to actually maybe accelerate and be a catalyst for traffic so you actually get some awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Yeah, and you can do LinkedIn, you can do Facebook, but Facebook is quite targeted. You can select by demographics and location amongst a lot of other things, and then you can do Google AdWords as well. It depends. Its sometimes worth doing a couple of paid tactics actually to test to see what works.
        </p>
        <p>
         Announcer:  Youre listening to the Content Champion Podcast, showcasing the best content marketing strategies across the web.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Were back with Jeff Bullas. Were looked at blogging, weve looked at social media, SEO, paid traffic, what other traffic sources should we perhaps consider?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: We havent gone too much into email but emails very, very important. We mentioned at the beginning emails great because when you build a list you actually own it. That, again, is earned. The best tactic for that is giving away something for free. It could be a free video tutorial, some people can opt-in by giving away their email address and then in return they get something, a premium content value.
        </p>
        <p>
         It might be a free book or a free online video tutorial. That is really important. From day one, especially in B2B, that should be done. That is so important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Im on your list. I love reading your stuff. Could you outline some of the strategies youre using with your blog broadcasts and other stuff that we get through your email list?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I work very hard on creating a headline, then I also work very hard on making sure the intro will tempt them to read the rest of it. When I send out an email in my email broadcast to my opt-in list, I dont give them the whole article, I only give them the intro with a hyperlink to read the rest on the blog.
        </p>
        <p>
         I dont reveal the answers in that email. Its basically a teaser to say  They got to click on the headline first, then theyve got to read the intro, and then theyre going to say, Im fascinated. What is going to be revealed here?
        </p>
        <p>
         Youve got to drive that curiosity and thats really, really important. Ive seen a lot of people actually send out a whole blog post just in email. Then they got no reason to click through your website to get them online where they actually can engage with you further. Thats really, really important. Those tactics are vital to actually drive traffic to your blog so you actually can engage with them even more closely.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: As we talk Im looking at your website. In terms of personal branding, you are your brand. Your name and your company is your own personal brand. How important is that building that authority, that trust, that unique identity?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Theres two schools of thought that you can create a personal brand thats just your name. The problem is if you wanted to go and sell that online property later, then its very hard to because its you. Thats one aspect. On the other hand, with social media people do like to see people rather than just a brand. They like to see the human side.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think a personal brand is really important, and also being unique. I had an accidental success which is that caricature you see when you visit my blog which is different to your normal Photoshopped images that you see of people taken in studios. The feedback I had over time is its memorable, so it actually stands out.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think creating a unique brand, personal or business, is really important. I was going to originally use an image, just a photo of myself, but a friend of mine said, Why dont you use a caricature? He was an artist and he drew one for me and its really good. It worked. I think because its memorable, its different.
        </p>
        <p>
         You got to try to work out how you can stand out both with name and your branding, I suppose. Luckily for me I was able to get my name as a domain name because Ive got a different name. Im not John Smith. That wouldve been gone ten years ago. JeffBullas.com was available. That means its congruent with the brand as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Ive done something similar. Ive got a cartoon character, a superhero, and when I split tested that with my own photo, my sign-up rates on my email list more than doubled.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Wow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Its extraordinary but it does work because I guess theres loads of pictures like me, middle-aged slightly balding guys out there on blogs, so something a bit different is, like you said, more memorable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Exactly. Be memorable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Lets look at conversion. Obviously youre getting people to the site, they see your authority, they love your stuff, how do you turn them into consumers of your products and services rather than just tire kickers reading your content?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Its basically, I suppose, creating premium content. Youre basically creating trust through giving away free content and then once theyve seen that is then to offer premium content where theres a call to action. It might be your books, so youll need to actually write good copy.
        </p>
        <p>
         You then need to make it easy for them to buy, and then tactics such as webinars are really important, especially if youre selling a more high-value product. Webinars are very important from conversion point of view, a series of free webinars, and also associating with other bloggers that actually can create an audience for you where they get a split of the sales. You got to be able to share what you make as well, so thats why affiliate works so well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Conversion comes down to actually understanding psychology and the principles of scarcity, the principles of call to action, and one of the things you mentioned, of course, is split testing. See what works and what doesnt and do more of the  Then optimize the one that works best and continue to  It could be changing the color of button from green to orange.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: I was talking to Jay Baer about the types of conversions on sites, the different types of offers you make to your audience and I find it really fascinating. Youre doing the same thing on your sidebar. Like you say youve got the webinar, youve got sign-up for the email list, the free e-book, and youve got various other graphical call to action touchpoints on the page. It gives people a choice to start clicking around and takes of action, doesnt it?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Yeah, and also you need to make sure that you have it high up or top right corner. Youll notice just about all three e-books are put in the top right corner because you want to build that email list. Some people make it really hard to find your free e-book.
        </p>
        <p>
         Theres certainly some really important rules have emerged for online marketing that are proven to work, so putting the high yielding, best returned, highest revenue products or affiliate that you might be pushing above the break. In other words, not below the fold of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: How are you measuring all this? Are you just using Google Analytics?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: Yeah, I just use Google Analytics. Theres other metrics they can tell you about traffic and conversion style. Email will tell you your open rates and so on, but Google Analytics where you have a conversion path.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: I do like to ask all my guests at this stage about trends in the coming year. Jeff, what do you see happening in the content marketing space over the next 12 months?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I think theres going to be more focus on taking control of your own digital assets rather than just doing Facebook marketing, especially as Facebooks wound back its organic reach. I think thats also going to result in more people spending money on Facebook advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think as Twitter rolls out its paid advertising I see more people using Twitter and I think Facebook reducing its organic reach is actually going to make people look more closely at platforms like LinkedIn.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ive been playing with LinkedIn, especially with its new publishing platform it announced in February, and I think its become more social and open and content-centric, which actually suits my strategy. LinkedIns something that Im going to pursue and I think a lot more people will, especially in the B2B space.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, I published a blog post for Monday this week on LinkedIns new publishing platform and Ive been playing with that the last month or two, month and a half. It really resonated so it became the second top post on LinkedIn globally for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: Wow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: It got 165,000 views. Most of those were in the first 24 hours. I had over 700 comments currently and it drove record traffic to my blog for two days. I think were going to see some really interesting stuff being done with LinkedIn over the next 12 months as well. Thats a big move.
        </p>
        <p>
         That really blew me away. Once you can do that, get to the homepage basically through your content on LinkedIn. Im going to have a look at different strategies and tactics for that as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: As I said, Im on your list. Im always showing your stuff on social media and it always gets a lot of click-throughs and drives a lot of interest. Could you remind us where we can find you and some of the stuff youve got available online please?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: You can find me at the blog at JeffBullas.com. J-E-double F-B-U-double L-A-S.com and you can find me on Twitter @JeffBullas and if you cant find me, just Google me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Announcer: Wait for it, listeners. Here comes the PS question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loz James: This is what I call the PS question. Could you please share one advanced content marketing strategy that my listeners can take away and use right after this call?
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeff Bullas: I think one advanced strategy Im using now is actually this LinkedIn publishing. I think thats really important. In terms of advanced, it does take time and commitment and its maybe not for everyone, but its to actually write a free e-book. If you can write and publish your own book, I think that actually lends some real credibility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even if its self-published. If you can actually publish and get it on Amazon and even put it on your own blog, I think thats really important because theres nothing like someone saying, Jeffs written a book, or, Johns written a book and here it is. Its well written, well researched.
        </p>
        <p>
         A book isnt that hard to actually write if you think about it because you actually can plan it out and actually write a chapter or two a week as blog posts. Then just compile them later and edit it and maybe add a bit more content at the end and you can turn a blog post into your own published book. I think thats really important and thats long-form content and it just adds credibility.

            Ill disagree with Jeff that more people will be inclined to do paid Facebook ads.  Most small and medium sized business Ive talked to are extremely frustrated with FB.

              Hi Adam
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for dropping by.
             </p>
             <p>
              I take your point about Facebook and that many businesses find it frustrating, but I think Jeffs point is that its still an important part of the marketing mix  for now.
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess we need to use as many traffic sources as possible, blogging, outreach, social media, video, podcasting  and paid traffic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Facebook is becoming more and more of a paid platform  which will of course have a shelf life for most small businesses as the prices hike when more people get on board (let alone taking into account any potential click fraud etc).
             </p>
             <p>
              Cheers!
