How would you describe your music for someone completely unfamiliar?

I'd describe my music as honest Folk. I take a lot of influence from Punk 
Rock since that's what i grew up listening to as a kid and I think that's 
where the honesty comes from.

Your website says you have an &quot;uncontrollable compulsion to be brutally 
blunt.&quot; Has this overall helped you or gotten you into trouble?

I think a mixture of both haha. I think I can be a little bit intimidating 
sometimes to people because I tend to just say things as they are, I didn't 
really notice that I did until I started touring and meeting new people. 
I'm a big softie at heart though, my best friends will tell you that haha.

Your facebook says &quot;If a man does something bold it's considered romantic, 
but if a woman does something bold it's considered desperate, so, don't 
throw stones at my window, or i will call the police...&quot; What made you want 
to include this on the site?

I wrote that years ago, before i even started playing shows really. It 
stated out as a bit of a joke between me and a couple of friends because 
I'm really into the TV Show Sex And The City, and all my mates kept saying 
they would never in a million years have thought that I would be. There's a 
scene in the show where Carrie Bradshaw is on the street throwing stones up 
at a window and I always thought she looked really desperate, so I put a 
little but of a spin on it and put it up there. Now people ask me about it 
all the time thinking I might come out with some interesting Feminist 
views, which I do have, but I always end up telling the SATC story and they 
always look confused.

Who/What is your favourite animal?

Courtney Love is my favourite animal. I've never really listened to her 
music, nor do i know much about her, but whenever i read things that shes 
said, or catch an interview i always think we'd get along like a house on 
fire.

What inspires you most?

Travelling inspires me more than anything right now. I started travelling 
when I was younger because I felt like I needed to run away and escape for 
a while, and I just ended up falling in love with it. Now I don't feel like 
I need to run away anymore as an adult and I do it because it's amazing and 
probably my favourite thing to do on the planet aside from playing music. 
I'm lucky that doing both of those things go hand in hand.

If I were to show up to your place requesting a vegan dinner, what would 
you make? What would we do for fun?

Ohhh! That's a tough one! I make killer Fajitas so i think id do a vegan 
twist on them and we could listen to records. I play a lot of videogames 
too, so if you're into that we could do some two player stuff and eat junk 
food all night!

What social causes are important to you?

I work in a day to day sexist environment. So over the past few years 
Sexism has become a massive part of my life. I honestly didn't really know 
what it was until I got the job I work in now a few years ago, probably 
because I was still quite young and naive even though I had been a victim 
of sexism before. Experiencing it so head on every day has really opened my 
eyes to it and how horrendous it really is. In fact, its probably 
completely changed my outlook on life for the better now, and I will 
literally stop and go out of my way to correct anyone when something sexist 
is said or done against anyone else.

What is your song writing process like?

I used to write songs everyday, all day. But over the past couple of years, 
with touring, travelling and working in the shop its become super hard to 
do that. Now I carry a note book around with me everywhere I go to make 
notes. I spend every day of my life playing guitar since it's my day job 
now, so writing the music just comes so naturally to me sometimes I feel I 
don't even have to think about it, but so much thought goes into the words 
I sing so i always do my best to articulate everything as best as I can. 
Even if that means I have to re-write something a dozen times.

What do you think it take for music to really impress you?

Something that really impresses me is when a songwriter can articulate 
their insignificance without literally saying it, and then put those words 
over some incredible sounding acoustic guitar. Out of the whole acoustic 
troubadour movement that's happened over the past few years, as great as it 
is, I always feel I don't need to know what literally happened second by 
second on the day your Ex dumped you. If you can put a but of anonymity 
into your words and let people draw their own relevance from what they 
hear, then that is impressive.

What's next for you musically?

Next for me is a new EP/album type thing. The first year I was touring i 
was so on it with recording and stuff I always had something new planned, 
but I've been slacking on it this past year or so. Then heading over to the 
USA again for some shows and to tour Europe again. I love Europe, so I 
can't wait for that.

                 How would you describe your music for someone completely unfamiliar?

               </p>
               <p>
                I'd describe my music as honest Folk. I take a lot of influence from Punk Rock since that's what i grew up listening to as a kid and I think that's where the honesty comes from.
               </p>

                 Your website says you have an "uncontrollable compulsion to be brutally blunt." Has this overall helped you or gotten you into trouble?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                I think a mixture of both haha. I think I can be a little bit intimidating sometimes to people because I tend to just say things as they are, I didn't really notice that I did until I started touring and meeting new people. I'm a big softie at heart though, my best friends will tell you that haha.

                <strong>
                 Your facebook says "If a man does something bold it's considered romantic, but if a woman does something bold it's considered desperate, so, don't throw stones at my window, or i will call the police..." What made you want to include this on the site?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                I wrote that years ago, before i even started playing shows really. It stated out as a bit of a joke between me and a couple of friends because I'm really into the TV Show Sex And The City, and all my mates kept saying they would never in a million years have thought that I would be. There's a scene in the show where Carrie Bradshaw is on the street throwing stones up at a window and I always thought she looked really desperate, so I put a little but of a spin on it and put it up there. Now people ask me about it all the time thinking I might come out with some interesting Feminist views, which I do have, but I always end up telling the SATC story and they always look confused.

                Courtney Love is my favourite animal. I've never really listened to her music, nor do i know much about her, but whenever i read things that shes said, or catch an interview i always think we'd get along like a house on fire.

               <p>
                Travelling inspires me more than anything right now. I started travelling when I was younger because I felt like I needed to run away and escape for a while, and I just ended up falling in love with it. Now I don't feel like I need to run away anymore as an adult and I do it because it's amazing and probably my favourite thing to do on the planet aside from playing music. I'm lucky that doing both of those things go hand in hand.

                Ohhh! That's a tough one! I make killer Fajitas so i think id do a vegan twist on them and we could listen to records. I play a lot of videogames too, so if you're into that we could do some two player stuff and eat junk food all night!

               <p>
                I work in a day to day sexist environment. So over the past few years Sexism has become a massive part of my life. I honestly didn't really know what it was until I got the job I work in now a few years ago, probably because I was still quite young and naive even though I had been a victim of sexism before. Experiencing it so head on every day has really opened my eyes to it and how horrendous it really is. In fact, its probably completely changed my outlook on life for the better now, and I will literally stop and go out of my way to correct anyone when something sexist is said or done against anyone else.

                 What is your song writing process like?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                I used to write songs everyday, all day. But over the past couple of years, with touring, travelling and working in the shop its become super hard to do that. Now I carry a note book around with me everywhere I go to make notes. I spend every day of my life playing guitar since it's my day job now, so writing the music just comes so naturally to me sometimes I feel I don't even have to think about it, but so much thought goes into the words I sing so i always do my best to articulate everything as best as I can. Even if that means I have to re-write something a dozen times.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 What do you think it take for music to really impress you?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Something that really impresses me is when a songwriter can articulate their insignificance without literally saying it, and then put those words over some incredible sounding acoustic guitar. Out of the whole acoustic troubadour movement that's happened over the past few years, as great as it is, I always feel I don't need to know what literally happened second by second on the day your Ex dumped you. If you can put a but of anonymity into your words and let people draw their own relevance from what they hear, then that is impressive.
               </p>

                <strong>
                 What's next for you musically?
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Next for me is a new EP/album type thing. The first year I was touring i was so on it with recording and stuff I always had something new planned, but I've been slacking on it this past year or so. Then heading over to the USA again for some shows and to tour Europe again. I love Europe, so I can't wait for that.
