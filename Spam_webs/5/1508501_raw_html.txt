       <p>
        <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">
         Other Canadians
        </span>
        dont really like Toronto  there was even a
        <a href="http://www.hotdocslibrary.ca/en/detail.cfm?filmId=11571">
         documentary
        </a>
        released to that effect. Were not your typical Canadians. We love Canada, but we
        <i>
         adore
        </i>
        Toronto. This metropolitan pride is often mistaken for arrogance; really, were just misunderstood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Im going to teach you how to get the best out of a Torontonian by telling you how to get the worst.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Say, I hate Toronto.
       </h5>
       <p>
        No you dont. Youre jealous. You had to move to one of the softer cities because Toronto smells bad / the people are fake and boring / the Leafs suck / or any other excuse you tell yourself to help you sleep at night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the truth is: You just couldnt hack it here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Toronto is a big city, especially when compared to the majority of other Canadian towns. It can be impersonal, competitive, and there are absolutely people ready to step on you to get ahead. This is a symptom of living in a place where there are boundless opportunities; we are passionate about what we do and every day are witness to what we can make of ourselves with hard work and tenacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Endless opportunities also mean you make your own fun. Seek and you shall find. If youre into LARPing, would like to play pickup dodgeball, or want to discuss shamanic practice, theres a group, club, or community for you. If something truly is lacking, start it yourself. Im sure youll find someone else who is interested in competitive toe wrestling.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Sit
        <i>
         right
        </i>
        next to me on the TTC when there are plenty of empty seats.
       </h5>
       <p>
        We dont like things out of the ordinary, and its not normal to invade a Torontonians personal space without need or invite. We dont like close face-talkers. And we definitely dont like when theres an empty bus, subway, or streetcar and someone we dont know chooses to sit right next to us. Theres no desire for that on public transportation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blame it on the fact that we already have close-knit friend groups, or that we fear becoming a statistic, but we stay away from strangers. Making eye contact or chatting with a stranger in Toronto is seen as a sign of mental instability, so even if we are friendly, its just so that you dont follow me home to eat my liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Believe that Drake is the best thing out of Toronto
        <i>
         ever
        </i>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        He sells a lot of albums and we are all happy for him. But Aubrey Graham will always be Jimmy from
        <i>
         Degrassi
        </i>
        to me, and no amount of tattoos and dating Rihanna will change that. Besides, knowing that the average home in Forest Hill where he grew up goes for $4.32 million kind of ruins that whole Started from the Bottom thing.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Walk slowly.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Get out of my way. I really do have somewhere to be. Before
        <a href="http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/on-seeing-past-your-rose-colored-view-of-place/">
         my stint in the Caribbean
        </a>
        , I could send an email from my Blackberry with gloved hands while drinking coffee and
        <i>
         still
        </i>
        overtake people on the sidewalk. We get it: You want to take in the sights and sounds of the city. Great. But do it in the slow lane, not the middle of the sidewalk. Baby, its cold outside and Ive got happy hour drinking to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Oh yeah, and give a girl a warning if youre
        <i>
         stopping
        </i>
        . Thats a 10-latte pileup waiting to happen.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Tell people youre from Toronto when youre not.
       </h5>
       <p>
        I remember when the boroughs of Toronto were amalgamated into the Greater Toronto Area. I heard it on the radio while cruising with my mom in the car. If you are from Pickering, Mississauga, or Brampton, then you are from the GTA. You come in from your boring boroughs, do the wild and crazy weekend thing and give us, the classy urbanites, a bad name. Not to mention, we probably wouldnt be seen at that club you went to, and at the very least we wouldnt have had to spend $400 on bottle service for the privilege.
       </p>
       <p>
        East Gwillimbury is part of the GTA  would you consider residents of this town Torontonians? No. So neither are you.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Ask me if I voted for Rob Ford.
       </h5>
       <p>
        I did not. No one I know admits to having voted for Rob Ford. I laugh at his antics and occasionally respect him for doing what he wants and not being influenced by popular opinion. But of course, that is his downfall. Put that in your crack pipe and smoke it.
       </p>
       <h5>
        Ignore how awesome it is here.
       </h5>
       <p>
        People often say that Toronto is like New York, but without all the famous stuff. Or that its a wannabe New York. First of all,
        <i>
         oh, no you didnt!
        </i>
        Secondly, that is shallow. Comments like that say you havent spent enough time in Toronto, in New York, or both.
       </p>
       <p>
        Toronto does have famous stuff, but thats beside the point. Toronto is the people, who come from every corner of the world and bring their music, celebrations, and cuisine. Toronto is celebrity sightings but no crazy paparazzi. Toronto is the worst metropolitan transit system in world, but home to the longest surface route line in North America (501 Queen Streetcar). Toronto is cultural and historical neighbourhoods, museums, theatres, beautiful parks, and unique annual festivals.

           Well written! I also hate people who walk slowly up the stairs or stop on the escalators during rush hour on the TTC.or those who stand by the doors of a crowded train and cant be bothered to move towards the middle or ends of the cart, where its completely empty (even after I ask them to move in because about a hundred other people are trying to get into the train).

             Sorry but the first paragraph is bullshit.. I most certainly have hacked it here and still dont like this city.. When it grows mountains and an oceanfront I might consider it a better place to live.. Until then, Torontonians can keep making up bullshit like this to make themselves feel better about living in a dysfunctional city.. Toronto doesnt rank anywhere near the top in quality of life surveys of major urban centres and probably never will due to its inept city council

                 Hey!  Weve got great Fossil Fields here in Cincinnati!  Can you say Glacial Till?  We dont have mountains, but the hills are scary when they ice over.  This makes them great for sled riding though! Weve got a river that runs past Cincinnati.  We found a good use for it.  We have the WEBN Fireworks on it every Labor Day!
                 <br/>
                 Seems to me that some people will be unhappy wherever they are because they are unable to find the good side of any place.  They always imagine that someplace else would be better and they are almost always disappointed.

             Hallelujah!  Preaching to the choir here!  It drives me nuts when people stand in the doorway blocking people from getting in or out.  The only thing worse is if they are SMOKING while blocking the door!  Im horribly allergic to smoke and nicotine and had to shove past some of these guys while holding my breath!  One of them followed me into the restaurant and complained.  I explained to him that I was highly allergic to both nicotine and smoke and that I was running out of air from holding my breath while trying to get past them.  (You must understand that Ohio had to institute a LAW that no one may smoke within 25 feet of any public building  or within any public building  because people could not gain access to these buildings because of the gauntlet they had to pass through.)  I pointed out that they were not only NOT 25 feet from the door, as the LAW required, they were blocking the entrance for anyone with a similar disability as mine (for which I must carry an inhaler, even though I am not asthmatic because of the severity of my allergic reactions).  Perhaps people need to be more aware of NON-VISABLE HANDICAPS as well as the ones you can see.
             <br/>
             There was recently an article about a nasty note left on the BMW near a health club parked in a handicapped space  Turns out the owner of the car was a quadriplegic.  The letter writer assumed that because he was driving an expensive car to a health club that he couldnt be handicapped!  Gee!  In a perfect world
             <br/>
             Anyway, show courtesy to others.  Dont block doors or walkways or escalators.   Dont smoke until youve checked that it will not bother and/or harm those around you.  Remember, not all handicaps are obvious.  And last, everyone has their own comfort levels on personal space.  If they indicate youre too close, try to back up a little.

           Whoever wrote this is the petty voice of a society obsessed with pointless hard work and competition at the expense of everyone else. Consumerism dominates here in Toronto and feeds the ego of shallow, narcissists like yourself who must imagine that in the grand scheme of things they are somehow valid. For you this is the fact that you can hack it in Toronto, well, guess what thats a very sad and shallow truth for you to figure out. Enjoy being alone on the Subway, because god forbid someone sit beside you, particularly when you live in Toronto. You are the type that would take up two seats while every other seat on the streetcar is full and a 70 year old lady fumbles to sit down, yapping on your phone about how amazing you are that you live in Toronto.

             Hi Dean. I may have to repeat this a few times, but this is a satirethese are the vices of an otherwise great city that I, in fact, love living in. Comments about me and what I do arent fairinstead of making assumptions and ad hominem attacks look deeper into what you think is a shallow article. I have travelled, worked and lived abroad for extended periods and I came up with some of these points because of how different things were abroad. In other places, chatting someone up on public transport is the norm and at first I was surprised. Eventually, I came to like itand I miss it when Im in the city.
            </p>

             P.S. I dont have a cell phone. Or an iPod. I believe in human interaction.

               Alyssa, I loved Toronto too when I visited.  I agree that cell phones and iPods keep people from interacting as well as they could with direct human interaction.  You cant see a persons expression and hand gestures over a phone and you cant hear the tone of voice in a text.  That being said, cellphones are useful when youre running late or your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.  I wish that they charged more for the calls though.  My sister calls me up at least five times a day just to say hi
              </p>
              <p>
               People say the streets of Cincinnati roll up at 9:00 p.m. and that they are twenty years behind the time (see comment attributed to Mark Twain, When the end of the world comes, I want to be in           Cincinnati because its always twenty years behind the times.) but I find it a very nice place to live.  People greet you to their homes with Have you eaten yet? and by the time youve visited three times, youre family.  I guess its a German, Italian, Irish thing about Cincinnati.

             Consumerism fuels economies and pays the bills.  I work hard and play hard so I cant fault him.  As for people sitting too close when other seats are available, I would say Alyssa has a well developed sense of self-preservation.  The author is not suggesting being a seat hog, rather, if there is space available, why not spread out so we can be comfortable and feel safe?

           Man, I had the best conversation with an 81 year old Chinese man about tango, salsa and rock n roll dancing on the 501 streetcar while there were plenty of open seats, and neither of us are mentally unstable. I actually had a great laugh with him after he looked at me said I know, its crazy, Im still alive! Occasionally its nice to share experiences and friendly conversations with a stranger, and I pity the ones who miss out on lifes experiences like this because they dont want to become a statistic. Hell. I even got a sweet little kiss on the hand out of it before I got off at my stop. Also, if you listen to a Drake album and not just a few made-for-radio singles and you know anything about rap lyricism, youd realize that Drake, stripped of his ego, is a lyrical genius recognized by critics and rap legends alike. Of course taste in music is subjective, but refusing to accept the success of someone who represents your city out of plain stubbornness is just annoying. And who really cares if someone from Mississauga or Brampton says theyre from Toronto? Oh, and sometimes, Im not in a rush to go anywhere, so I dont feel the need to speed walk down the sidewalk. Im not from here, I moved here. I love ALMOST everything about the city- and the only thing I do miss about living outside the province is the absence of the stereotypical Torontonian who thinks their downright arrogance is just a misunderstanding- and trying to defend it by writing the most arrogant, pretentious and narcissistic article Ive read in a long-ass time. Strip Toronto of all these personalities and its probable the most beautiful, bustling  multicultural city in Canada. (:

             Hi Emily, thanks for commenting. I totally agree about missing out on life experiencesgod forbid you make a new friend! Thats awesome that you had that experience. Ive also met some really interesting people on brief public transport encounters. I dont think that I implied I dont accept Drakes successin fact  I stated the opposite. I like his music, though I dont really bother with most rap and/or hip-hop post Bling Bling.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyhow, I think you make my point for methese are stereotypes of Torontonians, stereotypes may be founded in reality but arent always the true, and beyond that, this city is pretty awesomeeven if there arent mountains and oceans as Matej pointed out.

           Ive never been to Toronto, but wanted to move there once. Im from Miami and get irritated when travel bloggers write about Miami, yet they were in Hollywood or Ft. Lauderdale yes, and please dont say youre from Miami if youre not from one of the two area codes we have. This article cracks me up.

           I lived in Toronto for about 9 years, and found it to be a very fine city. I would still be there now if it were not for the shortage of jobs in my specialised field.

           In all seriousness, how could one NOT love Toronto? The city offers everything fathomable and every possible subculture in existence. Despite the facade of competition and consumerism, Toronto is in fact one of the most down to earth and genuine major cities that I have had the pleasure of living in. True enough, there is slight variation between neighbourhoods, but in general its OneLove. This article is amusing and almost bang on  despite the misplaced comment regarding stranger apprehension.Toronto offers huge amount of eye contact and smiles, helpful people and some of the most inspiring ad hoc conversations one can have while on the TTC, waiting in line for some awesome food, or even just crossing an intersection. Open your mind up &lt;3

             Lol wow look its another Toronto retard. You actually think that helping people just a tiny bit or honking the horn lightly is politeness. Eye contact and smiles? I dont know where you were but I think youre hallucinating. Youve gotten so used to the anti social culture in Toronto that you actually think people are smiling at you. Are you proud that there is so many opportunities to stuff your face with some awesome food? Well good luck trying to lose that weight. That is why you got so many fat, ugly bitches walking around the street. Well, go ahead, line up and stuff your face fatty.

               Very origional. Whats the matter your girl run off to the big city?  I have travelled all over and Toronto is where I choose to live because it has great multicultural neighborhoods and tons of friendly people. The ugly britches thing is just uncalled for and petty. I dont know your issue with the city but if you hate it, dont visit. But dont pretend your opinion makes it any less great.

           Toronto is a city devoid.
           <br/>
           Having lived there for 10 years (now based in London) it is like a manilla envelope.
           <br/>
           Boring, plain, open.
           <br/>
           There is no core, general mistrust, a stinky lake which is constantly being obstructed by cheap concrete and glass condos etched by wind.
           <br/>
           The people are nice, but insecure.
           <br/>
           Sure, Torontonians think that they are better than everyone, because they know the other cities of the world are constantly improving.
           <br/>
           Enjoy myopia.

             Sorry you can find nothing nice about Toronto.  What have you done to make it less terrible place to live in?
             <br/>
             One of my schoolmates, Maria Olberding was murdered here while out jogging, but instead of hating the city where their daughter died, her parents instituted the Reggae Run in Cincinnati to make it a less terrible place.  Nothing going on in downtown Cincinnati?  Liven up the streets of Cincinnati with the Big Pig Gig, Oktoberfest or Riverfest. The point is  Instead of hating a place for not being what you want it to be, why dont you start something to make it more like a place you want to live in?

           You wouldnt believe the amount of hate people have for Toronto over here.

           I tried to understand why so every time someone hates I ask Have you been to Toronto?

          <p>
           Most people say no.

             Hahah I dont care even the tiniest bit about Hockey but when I lived in Van, whenever I heard people chanting GO CANUCKS, Id yell out GO LEAFS GO.
             <br/>
             just to be ornery.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think Quebecers hate us the most.
             <br/>
             The feeling is mutual from me.

            <p>
             When I moved back to Toronto from New York (Toronto is my hometown)
             <br/>
             I couldnt believe how nasty and mean a lot of Torontonians are. It was so funny to me, because New York has this reputation for being cold and Canadians dont but I found this to be the complete opposite.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ive since moved out of the downtown core and into Scarborough though and again, completely against all gossip its actually not that bad here. Friendlier people than downtown for sure and as long as you stay away from a couple key areas, safe as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             I love Canada and Toronto is the only place Id want to live in Canada just keep me away from Rob Ford and anyone who thought it was a good idea to have him in office

               I dont have a  high opinion about the people of Quebec because of personal experience. There was a high school group of Quebecers visiting America while I was in Cincinnati.  One of the girls started making rude comments about a heavy set woman in the store we were in, speaking in French.  I walked up to her and told her (in French) that I understood what she had said and to grow up.  I think she assumed all Americans speak only English.  I can speak French a bit (learned it over 25 years ago with little opportunity to keep it fresh with practice) understand some German and Spanish and even know a few phrases in Japanese.
               <br/>
               Please dont assume that because you are in a foreign country that the people around you will not understand what you say.  Dont use your foreignism as an excuse to speak rudely about others in another language.   Be polite and speak in the common language of the group.

                 Please dont assume that an entire community is rude because of the comment of one high school girl. You have the right to your opinion but please dont jump to conclusions so quickly. Because Ive worked with a lot of American tourists and some of them were very disrespectful but I never assumed all Americans were like that.

                 And for the record, we do not hate english speaking Canadians. There will always be people hating for no reason (both francophones and anglophones) but that will always be a minority of ignorant people.

                   I simply wished  to point out that ALL people need to take into consideration that their words may be understood even if they speak in a language not prevalent to the region.
                   <br/>
                   I know very many wonderful people from Canada (my brother-in-law to name the one closest to me), but I had a negative experience with a girl from Quebec who assumed that she could call someone a fat pig, ugly, and smelly (though the woman had no scent to her that I could detect, and I am very scent sensitive because of my allergies) simply because she was speaking in a foreign language.  Her two friends were laughing at her comments as well so it was quite off-putting to me.    I have not met anyone from Quebec since that time to wash away that negative memory.  I hope I do, because I dont like that feeling.
                   <br/>
                   My father met a man in Costa Rica who asked it he spoke Spanish.  My father answered no, but I speak German.  They ended up having a wonderful conversation in German, which was neither of their native languages, because neither of them made the assumption that the other didnt  have a language in common in which they could communicate.
                   <br/>
                   I am sorry I met such a poor example of a Quebecer (what do you call someone from Quebec?) first.  You seem much nicer.  I am sorry you met some American tourists who behaved badly.  Why do people assume that they may behave badly when they are away from home on a trip?
                   <br/>
                   My sister was on a trip when a man and his wife asked her to dinner because she had such a lovely smile.  Turns out that they came from the same town in Michigan.  Odder still it turned out that the young man was also my fathers godson who he hadnt seen since the mans parents were divorced over thirty years before. Guess it was good that my sister was a good tourist!

                   high school girls in gangs in a country that has a different official language, and you make judgements about the Quebecois from that?  Please dont speak from personal experience when you clearly dont have much.  Your comment doesnt have much at all to do with the original article, which I found funny in the way that it was clearly only aimed at Torontonians, who are the only people who will get it (like all you know youre from [x] when-type articles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I highly recommend you try visiting Quebec sometime, and not just Montreal.  The people are the friendliest Ive met in Canada (far more so than Toronto) and despite widespread corruption and oppressive politics, there is warmth and openness driven by individual people reacting against the non-representative views of a xenophobic government.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Fat-shaming is gross and of course that high school girl was in the wrong, whatever language she was speaking in (although hiding behind a language she thought no one else could understand almost makes it worse).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   A non-Quebecois Canadian saying they hate Quebec is just par for the course to be funny or satirical or to fit in  like sports fans automatically hating their teams rival, it is a very constructed and impersonal hatred that is really part of much larger networks of yadayadayada  but someone basing their opinion of a culture on one interaction is just plain ignorant.

             Is this like the people who say they live in a suburb OUTSIDE the city of Detroit (in Michigan in the USA)?  I always laugh when they deny that they live in Detroit.  The same is true with Pittsburg PA.  For some reason theyre always destroying Pittsburg in the Superhero Comic Books my friend Celeste reads.

           and saying that we have the worst metro system in the world implies that you have never been anywhere else.. ours is sooooo clean and comparatively quite roomy to lets say, paris london new york. granted, the actual subway routes are limited.

             when is the last time you were in NYC?They have wider trains now, and aside from GIANT RATS and tons of roaches they arent much dirtier really, plus nicer workers, better routes better times overall better really.

               In Ohio you just have to be psychic when you drive.  Surely you should know that I was going to turn there without my turn signal.  You should have known I was going to run that red light.  Of course you should have known that I wanted to be in your lane  There is no metro system though I hear theyre planning to install a two mile loop of trolley cars in Cincinnati.
               <br/>
               The last time I was in NYC, I was running through the terminal to catch a flight.  I was on my way to France where, if you can read the maps, their metro system is really great way to get around  Their public toilets are scary as anything Ive ever experienced though (this includes the park decomposition toilets Ive used  you know the ones Im referring to).

           Having bought into the hype, I moved to and lived in Toronto for 4 years, I took advantage of every professional, cultural and social opportunity the city had to offer and after 4 years I jumped at the first opportunity to leave. I dont need to go into all the reasons that drove me to flee but suffice it to say that when I find myself in a truly world class city, I appreciate it that much more when I think back on my time in your fair city. Ive been back many times since but I try to spend as little time there as possible and do whatever I can to avoid overnight stays. Yes, Toronto is, in many ways, a lovely city, but I thank God every day that I dont live there.

             um excuse me, the Aubrey has a fairly wealthy uncle who supported both him and his mother. I know this because I worked for his uncle for years before he became a rap star. They were hardly living in poverty, their bills were often paid by his uncles company and I was the bookkeeper.

           The article is funny but I dont agree with some of it. I dont find it hard hitting (unless youre in govt or the financial district). I chatted to people on the TTC, I found Torontonians to be super friendly, much more so than the west coasters .I once had a random guy give me a piggy back for 1km home at 3am when I was drunk and he didnt even try to hit on me afterwards. Ive travelled a lot in the past 10 years to all corners of the world and learned to  appreciate how unique Torontos multiculturalism is, its like the whole world living in peace in one city. For those that might scoff at that, you must truly get out there to understand the difference between TOs minor racial issues and serious ones abroad. Unfortunately, even though I spent most of my life as a Torontonian, I found that although it was easy to make new friends, they were mostly superficial and dating there is a freakin nightmare hell. I left two years ago and moved to Cape Town (Ive got 2 oceans and lots of mountains

           I am much happier here but will always have Tdot in my heart.

           On hot summer August day in 1995 a subway deadly train crash

             - rush hour this train line is shut down get off and take the buses we have set up for you -hell.
             <br/>
             People literally shoving EN MASS to get on limited available buses. I was completely disgusted by us every time Ive been involved in this nonsense and yet when it happens in NYC everyone moves where are they supposed to move to, Buses show up, people help elderly and women with children to get on AND get a seat etc. wtf is wrong with us that we just go INSANE?)

           I remember when the boroughs of Toronto were amalgamated into the Greater Toronto Area. I heard it on the radio while cruising with my mom in the car.

          <p>
           What does this even mean? The GTA is an area or region that includes the City of Toronto. Get your facts straight.

             The small cities surrounding toronto, including scarborough and etobicoke, as well as The former or original city of toronto, were bundled together and named the GTA in 1998. Thats what the amalgamation was.
             <br/>

               Uh nope. In 1998 Scarborough, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke and the old city of Toronto were amalgamated to create the current City of Toronto. NOT the GTA.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is no actual city named GTA. Like I said above, the GTA is the entire area that includes the amalgamated City of Toronto plus the four regional municipalities that surround it (York, Peel, Durham, Halton).

           *this* is what I strongly dislike about Toronto, as a Torontonian that lives in it Blame it on the fact that we already have close-knit friend groups, or that we fear becoming a statistic, but we stay away from strangers. Making eye contact or chatting with a stranger in Toronto is seen as a sign of mental instability, so even if we are friendly, its just so that you dont follow me home to eat my liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti

               i love my city, i was born and raised in toronto, but the city and the people in it can be walking contradictions
              </p>
              <p>
                i randomly talk to people all the time out on the street, and its funny because when i do it? people get shocked, as if i broke some code of silence
              </p>
              <p>
               i really thought toronto was the be all and end all, but once i went to nyc and london uk!?
              </p>
              <p>
               i now somewhat pity my city
              </p>
              <p>
               we dont really talk here, girls dress very sexual, they dont talk, guys look at girls in a sneaky way, you have to be in the know to really know whats going on, the city is run by groups and cliques, and if youre not within there circle or did not go to school with them, or if they simply do not like you since theyre afraid youll take away there friends, then guess what? youre not invited
              </p>
              <p>
               toronto is a very colourful and dynamic city, the thing is? the only people that seem to have a voice are the rich/hippy kids
              </p>
              <p>
               so, all other areas that dont really get mentioned arent really included or apart of anything :s
              </p>
              <p>
               the passive aggressive racism here gets more funny as the years go by
              </p>
              <p>
               i sometimes think, they people who think theyre the only ones that matter in this city secretly have an agenda kick most minorities out of the city and have it only be mostly white and asian
              </p>
              <p>
               with that being said, toronto is getting weirder by the day/month and year, so who knows what other left hooks or surprises await our prettypity city

             I may not want you seated RIGHT next to me because I am allergic to your cologne or the nicotine smell from your clothes.  I may not want you sitting so close to me because I wear bifocals and if you sit too close I will not be able to focus on you because you have put yourself in that ambiguous space were neither part of the lenses I wear can bring you into focus.  I may have been a victim of rape where I cannot handle any male within two feet of me  The point is, people often need personal space for good reasons.  Are you suggesting that you can tell, just by looking, that none of these people deserve personal space on public transit?  Alyssa was asking that people should use the available space and spread out rather than piling on top of one another when the space is available.

             By the way, the last scenario mentioned above is a friend of mine.  We avoid public transit systems because some people cant respect her need for the space to feel safe.  I fall into category one and two.  I have had to hold people at an arms length so I can focus on them and I can end up gasping for breath and even throwing up thanks to the allergic reaction to someones perfume or smoky jacket.

           It really is a wannabe New York and yes, Ive lived in both. I have always wished Toronto  could just be happy being itself without always being so try-hard in certain ways. Also Vancouver has much much MUCH worse public transit. I mean the two are incomparable. (yeh I lived there too).

             The funny thing is Torontontians/Toronto NEVER described itself as wannabe New York. Its other cities that describe it like that. Its like when people ask me if I could describe Quebec City or Montreal I would say Its like a European City that doesnt mean those citiies are wannabe European Cities, its just the easiest way to describe us to understand. Do you get what I mean? If anything, I rather say its more of like Chicago than New York. One of the major reasons other people describe us as a mini-New York, just look at how many movies/films were made in Toronto AS New York City in Hollywood. THATS why. Toronto has its own personality, just unfortunately always described as a shadow to its bigger brother New York. (Also a fun fact, Toronto could actually have been New York today. The old name of Toronto was The Town of York and when the population grew we were going to rename ourselves New York but unfortunately New Amsterdam had just changed theirs to now the current New York. Instead the people from the Town of York decided to pick a name that echoes its native roots tkaranto meaning a meeting place in Iroqouis)

               Obviously we are not going to refer to ourselves as wannabe New York its not exactly a flattering description, but its true anyway.

              <p>
               We are a relatively small city (relative to the largest cities in the world). Toronto has an inferiority complex about being this small dorky little Canadian city compared to NEW YORK or Paris,
              </p>
              <p>
               Like every little sister who wants to wear her big sisters cool clothes and every community college teacher who wishes they had what it took to teach at Yale, Of course Toronto wishes it were new York.
              </p>
              <p>
               Montreal is even worse, theyre not even Toronto and have a country-wide stereotype of being really white trash.
              </p>
              <p>
               Toronto streets are used to film New York  and Chicago scenes BECAUSE we look like New York and chicago, duh.

           I dont see how this is supposed to be taken as satire when in no way the site nor the author makes an attempt to state so until after someone has obviously been offended. You, like anyone else, are entitled to your opinion and also how you choose to represent it But I dont see how its fair that you in turn become offended by how ppl choose to perceive your view when initially you make no effort for it to be taken as a joke. I love many types of comedy, even satire as long as I am first aware that what it is. In this case, it took a little research on my part to find that out All Im saying is, if you want ppl to take this the right way it is important to make this clear first.

             Is that how you think satire works? It hangs a sign on it that screams Warning: Satire Ahead. Do slapstick, banter or puns have to do the same thing?
             <br/>
             Im just curious. Are we hand-feeding people the concept of humor now?
             <br/>
             Calling something satire is never an adequate get-out-of-jail-free card that so many people seem to think it is, but no one should have to say something is satire in order for you not to see that their intent may be humorous or a commentary on a larger issue.

           Piss off a Torontonian by walking slow? Ha! I am one of the few who actually walk fast in this city. They ALL walk slow! Ill be carrying a shit-ton of groceries while changing the music Im listening to and still manage to be annoyed by the slow people walking in the middle of the sidewalk, side by side.

           Lol. Toronto people are delusional retards that live on a pile of garbage. Saying that this is wannabe New York is what a normal human being would say. You think that there is endless opportunities in Toronto? To get that endless opportunity how the hell do you get around? Epic traffic jams happen everyday plus the subway breaks down every single minute. It might be the congested air or the needless stress that is causing it, but Toronto people are mental and do not act like a normal human being like the rest of this continent. There is something wrong with you if you actually love this city. You Toronto retards need to learn some respect and need to know your place. Youre not just wannabe New York. Youre wannabe human beings and most of all wannabe Canadians. I dont know what country youre suppose to be part of, but in my country of Canada, we respect each other. So do everybody in my country a favour and stop calling yourselves Canadians and giving our nation a bad name. Lol what a shithole.

           You totally had me until I remember when the boroughs of Toronto were amalgamated into the Greater Toronto Area. No you dont because no such thing ever happened. Mississauga is not a borough, and the GTA was not created. Its not an entity, just a loosely defined region. What you probably remember is when the cities that made up the former Metro Toronto were amalgamated into the City of Toronto, and everyone who grew up in those former cities also grew up in Metro Toronto, which makes them from Toronto. And why are you hating on people from the GTA anyway?

           People who say city people are lonely or that cities arent friendly or that theyre isolating are also clearly not from here. I have TONS of friends from all over the city, tons in my own neighbourhood, I always see people I know on the street all the time, there are just lots more people. People are stacked up around each other like crazy and if you live somewhere long enough you meet lots of them around you. In the suburbs your friends are spread around giant spans of space. Mine are all together. Its the opposite of lonely

           I think the author got confused somewhere between the boroughs not being part of the GTA and Toronto is the people, who come from every corner of the world and bring their music, celebrations, and cuisine. considering those people have to commute in from the boroughs to celebrate the festivities in Toronto

           No, theres nothing to be jealous of other than more bars to drink alcohol at and concerts.  No, its not that I cannot find a job there, its just that I dont want to live in a place full of Chinese, Pakistanis, etc  No, I am not jealous of your ridiculous stupid traffic rush hours and the lack of jobs because some other immigrant already took it.  No, I am not jealous of how everything is 6 times more expensive in Toronto and everything is crowded.

           As a 38-yr.old born and raised Torontonian, I cant stress enough, how disappointing this article is.  Its not even what it purports to be.  Instead of listing things that might piss-off someone from Toronto, the author has instead listed items that reinforce the notion, that we really are (stereotypically) whiny &amp; narcissistic populace; craving for the adulation, that other cities receive, naturally (Montreal-culture; Vancouver-landscape; New York-everything).
          </p>
          <p>
           The other How to piss-off a-articles have fun with the stereotypes.  This version, reads like a feeble attempt to maintain a sense of superiority.  The more I travel, the more I realize how accurate a label The Screwface Capital, really is.
          </p>
          <p>
           Off the top of my head, here are a few notions, that actually support the premise of the title:
          </p>
          <p>
           1.) Drinking a Starbucks in Kensington Market
           <br/>
           2.) Making fun of our hapless professional sports-teams (especially post-season success)
           <br/>
           3.) Talking about Montreals culture being so much better, then Torontos
           <br/>
           4.) Ordering Molson Canadian instead of the latest artisan micro-brewery offeringespecially in the West End
           <br/>
           5.) Driving a vehicle up and down main streets, while blasting a stereo; loud-muffler; etcextra points if the vehicle is lowered, has decals, and sports rims
           <br/>
           6.) Driving anything larger then a sedan, in the downtown core.
           <br/>
           7.) Talk glowingly about the Conservatives (provincial or federal)
           <br/>
           8.) Act like Torontos crime, is out-of-controland make statements, to this effect
           <br/>
           9.) Talk about how amazing the Molson Indy / CNE Airshow is
           <br/>
           10.) Forcing us to rely on the TTC
          </p>
          <p>
           Your premises were weak.
          </p>
          <p>
           That being said, Toronto is definitely filled with the slowest pedestrians, in the galaxyand Ford Nayshun, are right up there, with the Harper Neo-Cons, and McGuinty Liberals.

           How to piss off a Torontonian..
          </p>
          <p>
           It is fairly obvious to anyone who has spent a considerable duration of time amongst the socialite elite cunts that populate DT Toronto, that there are a multitude of ways to piss them off..
          </p>
          <p>
           In the spirit of contributing a useful manual of conduct that might enlighten people, one might consider writing a detailed set of instructions on how to not piss off a city full of superficial, entitled, arrogant, princesses..
          </p>
          <p>
           Im sure that the adversity that the average Canada Goose jacket wearing, Starbucks drinking, Belmont smoking, Beats by Dre wearing University graduate in Toronto faces must feel insurmountable at times..
          </p>
          <p>
           But as Im sure you all can imagine, it would be everyones utmost honour and priority to know exactly what it is we have to do in order to please thy profound subjects!!
          </p>
          <p>
           Toronto is: rich Asians shopping, regular Asians cooking..
          </p>
          <p>
           Rich Indians driving beamers, regular Indians driving taxi..
          </p>
          <p>
           Rich white people texting, regular white people working..
          </p>
          <p>
           Rich black people talking about how marginalized they are in a university that costs 30k a year,
           <br/>
           Regular black folks are working..
          </p>
          <p>
           Rich Italians being assholes,
           <br/>
           Regular Italians working..
          </p>
          <p>
           You see where Im going with this??
          </p>
          <p>
           All of the regular people in Toronto are too busy working all the time to reflect on social events and social conduct.. Regular Toronto people avoid DT at all costs because they dont want to be around a bunch of opinionated snobs from small towns (like Barrie) who regard the distinction of Torontonian as an achievement that they should be awarded for.

           The easiest way to piss off a Torontonian is to be an honest humble and friendly person If you do this and manage to achieve anything in this city you will be going against what the majority believe to be normal..
          </p>
          <p>
           If you have soul.. If you listen to jimmy Hendrix, if you dont spend all of your time shacked up in a small overpriced apartment, if you enjoy home made food, if you dont hashtag 416 or tdot in every picture you take, if you dont like living in a city that consists of having to be extremely drunk in order to withstand the constant barrage of cold calculated social climbing hedonistic man children that frequent any social gathering..
          </p>
          <p>
           Toronto is not for you
           <br/>
           Unless you are rich..
           <br/>
           Because everyone here lives to conjugate around people whos importance is based around completely superficial means of notoriety.
