      <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">
       DonaldKnuth
      </a>
      ,
      while revising the second volume of his
      <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">
       <i>
        Art

      . When he got the galleys
	  back, he saw that the publisher had switched to a new
	  digital typesetting system and was shocked at the poor
	  quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      He reasoned that because digital typesetting meant arranging 1's and 0's
      (ink and no ink) in the proper pattern, as a computer scientist he should
      be able to make a better job of it. He originally estimated that this
      would take six months but ultimately it took nearly ten years. He had to
      handle not only the challenges of routine typesetting such as
      right-justification and page formatting flexible enough to allow for
      different output styles, but also the additional demands of academic
      publishing footnotes, floating figures and tables, etc. And,
      beyond that, he had to tell the computer how to typeset formulas and other
      technical material.
     </p>
     <p>
      A year after he had begun, Knuth was invited to give one of the principal
      lectures at the AMS's annual meeting. He spoke on his work on T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X,
      presenting not only the typographical aspects but also the mathematical
      ideas behind the programs. T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X's popularity took off from there.
     </p>
     <p>
      An important boost to that popularity came in 1985 with the introduction
      of L
      <span class="a">
       a
      </span>
      T

      X by Leslie Lamport. This is a set of commands that allows
      authors to interact with the system at a higher level than Knuth's
      original command set (called Plain T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X). Another boost came in 1990,
      when Hans Hagen introduced ConT
      <span class="e">

      </span>
      Xt to the world; ConT
      <span class="e">

     </h2>
     <p>
      This section describes some of the major advantages of T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X systems.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Compared to word processors
     </h3>
     <p>
      Most people have used a word processor, so a comparison may be helpful.
     </p>
     <p>
      With a word processors your text is placed while you type it, referred to
      as "what you see is what you get." In contrast, T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X is a
      formatter: it separates the steps of entering the material and placing it
      on the page.
     </p>
     <p>
      To see the difference, consider how a typical user of each system might
      start a new section. In a word processor a typical user might start that
      section by hitting
      <code>
       &lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
      twice to get two lines of
      vertical space, typing "
      <code>
       Section 1.2: New results
      </code>
      ",
      clicking to highlight that text, clicking to select a larger type size,
      clicking to select a new type style, and finally entering two more lines
      of vertical space. A typical user T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X user will type into a file the
      line "
      <code>
       \section{New results}
      </code>
      ". That is, a word
      processing user is formatting the text as they enter it, while the T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X
      user describes the meaning of the text and later T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X will format it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beginners like word processing but when they graduate to complex jobs the
      appeal fades. Word processing a twenty page technical article is hard; for
      instance, keeping the vertical space between sections uniform is
      error-prone, and so is making sure that all of the bibliographic entries
      follow the required format. In particular, very few people have both the
      knowledge and the eye to correctly lay out equations people
      often say their equations "just don't look right." That is, as a
      user becomes more experienced and knowledgable the T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X approach of
      having the typesetting done by the program becomes the better choice.
      (Some word processors offer as advanced features T
      <span class="e">
       e
      </span>
      X-like facilities for
      organizing input text, although few users take advantage of them.)

     <h3>

        This is especially holds for complex documents such as ones with

        X lets the software handle this task as much as is possible. For
	  instance, it automatically classifies each mathematical symbol as a
	  variable, or a relation, etc., and sets them with appropriate amounts
	  of surrounding space. It also sizes superscripts and subscripts,
	  radicals, brackets, and many other things. The result is that, because
	  your document follows the conventions of professional typesetting,
	  your readers will know exactly what you mean. You almost never have to
	  fret about the formulas. They just come out looking right.

        </span>
        X is extendible, so that innovations can be added on.
       </p>
       <p>
        An example is the L

        <span class="e">

        <span class="e">

        </span>
        X today. It extends T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X by adding convenience features
	  such as automatic cross references, sectioning, indexing, a table of
	  contents, automatic numbering of chapters, sections, theorems, etc.,
	  in a variety of styles, and a straightforward but powerful way to make
	  tables.

        L

        T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X also contains many features that encourage authors to
	  structure documents by meaning rather than by appearance. For
	  instance, a L
        <span class="a">
         a
        </span>
        T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X author might indicate an
	  acronym as "
        <code>
         the \ac{Tree Based Hashing}
	  method
        </code>
        ." This approach has two advantages. First,
	  since
        <code>
         \ac
        </code>
        is run by a computer and not hand-entered by a
	  person, we can rely on type style, size, etc., being the same
	  throughout the document; in this case the first time the acronym is
	  used in the paper it will appear as "Tree Based Hashing
	  (TBH)" while in later times "TBH" will be all that is
	  shown. Second, once information on the meaning is in the computer then
	  we can do more with it, perhaps by producing an index of acronyms.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, L
        <span class="a">
         a

        T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X itself can be extended. There are thousands of
	  "style files" that do everything from adapting the basics to
	  the needs of the
        <a href="ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf">
         American

        T
        <span class="e">
         e

        X's source files are portable to any computing platform. They are
	  compact; for instance, all of the files for
        <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra">
         my 450page
	  textbook and 125page answer supplement
        </a>
        fit easily on one
	  floppy disk. And, they integrate with other tools such as search
	  programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of this type of input file stems from T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X's roots in the world
	  of science and engineering where there is a tradition of close
	  cooperation among colleagues. A binary input format, especially a
	  proprietary one, is bad for cooperation: you probably have had to go
	  through the trouble of upgrading a word processor version because
	  coworkers upgraded and you could no longer read their files. With
	  T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X systems that rarely happens the last time that a

        X release lost even a small amount of
	  compatibility was in 1995.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another advantage of plain text is that the text may be automatically
	  generated, for instance if it is drawn out of a database for a report.
	  Getting a word processor into that work flow is a challenge. But T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X
	  fits right in.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are even ways to run T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X directly from XML input, which many
	  people think is the standard input format of the future. So, with the
	  T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X engine in the middle the input may be adjusted to meet your
	  needs, and changing times.

       7. The output can be anything.

        As with inputting, T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X's outputting step is separate from its
	  typesetting. The T
        <span class="e">
         e
        </span>
        X engine's results can be converted to a printer
	  language such as PostScript or to PDF or HTML, or, probably, to
	  whatever will appear in the future. And, the typesetting
	  line breaks, etc. will be the same no matter where your
	  output appears. (Did you know that word processing output depends on
	  the printer's fonts, so that if you email your work to someone with a
	  different printer then for them the line and page breaks are likely to
	  come out differently?)

      Many people find that T

      X's input language fits with how they think

        Because it is the standard, T
        <span class="e">

        X's support by other technical
