       Figurative language uses "figures
  of speech" - a way of saying something other than the literal
  meaning of the words. For example, "All the world's a stage"
  Frost often referred to them simply as "figures." Frost
  said, "Every poem I write is figurative in two senses. It
  will have figures in it, of course; but it's also a figure in
  itself - a figure for something, and it's made so that you can
  get more than one figure out of it."

     A figure of

      comparison
     </b>
     is made between two things
  essentially unalike. To Frost, metaphor is really what poetry
  is all about. He is notably a poet of metaphors more than anything
  else. This is so important, we should hear directly from the
  poet. Frost said," Poetry begins in trivial metaphors, pretty
  metaphors, 'grace metaphors,' and goes on to the profoundest
  thinking that we have. Poetry provides the one permissible way
  of saying one thing and meaning another. People say, 'Why don't
  you say what you mean?' We never do that, do we, being all of
  us too much poets. We like to talk in parables and in hints and
  in indirections - whether from diffidence or from some other
  instinct". ... Excerpt from an essay entitled "Education
  by Poetry" by Robert Frost.

  an object, person, situation or action) which stands for something
  else more abstract. For example our flag is the symbol of our
  country. The use of symbols in Frost's poetry is less obvious.
  Frost was not known as a Symbolist. Actually, the Symbolists
  were a late 19th century movement reacting against realism. Frost
  rebelled against this movement and preferred to use metaphors.
  There are certain signature images that become symbols when we
  look at Frost's complete work. Flowers, stars, dark woods and
  spring (the water kind) are consistent symbols in Frost's poetry
  and should be noted here. As with many other poetic devices,
  Frost had his own way of keeping the rule and breaking the rule.

  presentation of a thing with underemphasis in order to achieve
  a greater effect. Frost uses this device extensively, often as
  a means of irony. His love poems are especially understated.
  He cautions, "Never larrup an emotion."

  when a situation occurs which is quite the reverse of what one
  might have expected. Often, Frost's use of irony convey's one
  meaning by word and syntax, and another by the tone of voice
  it indicates. The tone contradicts the words. Frost's irony is
  usually tricky because it is so subtle.

  and good use of the place. Wild raspberries now grow where fruit
  used to be stored. This poem is full of irony.
