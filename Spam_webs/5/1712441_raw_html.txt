   The Importance of Angle of Attack
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Angle of attack is a very important and useful concept.
Most of the airplanes critical performance numbers are more
closely related to angle of attack than to anything else. Lets
explore what this means.
  </p>
  <p>
   Youve probably heard that it is good to fly
   <a id="hevea_default121">
   </a>
   the airplane by the numbers. The
question is,
   <em>
    what
   </em>
   numbers?
  </p>
  <p>
   Suppose we wish to achieve the best rate of climb:
  </p>
  <dl class="description">
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    <span style="font-weight:bold">
     A)
    </span>
    You could try to control the airplane by reference
to the rate of climb number shown on the vertical
speed indicator. This is not recommended!
   </dd>
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    <span style="font-weight:bold">
     B)
    </span>
    It would be better to maintain
    <span style="font-style:italic">
     V
    </span>
    <sub>
     Y
    </sub>
    ,
the nominal best-rate-of-climb speed, as shown on the airspeed
indicator, and accept whatever rate of climb results. This is
almost exactly the right idea.
   </dd>
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    <span style="font-weight:bold">
     C)
    </span>
    It would be even better to realize that the best
rate of climb is achieved at a particular angle of attack. In
particular, if the airplane is lightly loaded compared to what
was anticipated in the handbook, the best rate of climb will be
achieved at a lower speed than is reflected in the handbooks
    <span style="font-style:italic">
     V
    </span>
    <sub>
     Y
    </sub>
    value.
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
   This is not an isolated example. Many of the airplanes
critical performance numbers are really angle of attack numbers:
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The stall occurs at a particular angle of attack.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The smallest power-off descent rate occurs at
a particular angle of attack.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The best power-off glide ratio occurs at a particular
angle of attack.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The recommended approach speed is
really an angle of attack recommendation.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The best rate of climb occurs at a particular
angle of attack.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The best angle of climb occurs at a particular

to stall the airplane unless you pull back on the yoke and/or
apply lots of nose-up trim. This idea could save your
neck.

   <li class="li-itemize">
    Outside visual references also provide information
about angle of attack, if you know what to look for.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">

information about angle of attack, when the
airspeed is not too low. Correction factors must be
applied to correct for nonstandard weight and/or load

   I will now explain what angle of attack is, why it
is important, and how it is related to things a pilot can actually
observe and control.
  </p>
  <p>
   The basic idea is simple: the angle of attack
   <a id="hevea_default128">
   </a>
   is the angle at which the air hits the wing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Wright brothers had an angle of attack indicator on their first
airplane. It consisted of a stick attached to the wing, with a piece
of yarn dangling from the front end, as indicated in
   <a href="#fig-aoa-def2">
    figure 2.1
   </a>
   . The yarn aligns itself with the relative
wind.
   <sup>
    <a href="#note23" id="text23">
     4
    </a>
   </sup>
   The stick serves as a reference line, and also serves to
locate the yarn in a region of air that has not been too badly
disturbed by the wing.

   <a href="#fig-aoa-def2">
    Figure 2.1
   </a>
   : Simple Angle of Attack Instrument
  </div>
  <p>
   The angle between the stick and the yarn indicates
angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   The exact alignment of the indicator stick relative to the airplane is
not critical. The most elegant scheme is to orient the stick in the
   <a id="hevea_default130">
    <em>
     zero-lift direction
    </em>
   </a>
   so that zero angle of attack corresponds to
zero
   <a id="hevea_default131">
    coefficient of lift
   </a>
   . That choice will be used throughout this
book; see
   <a href="#sec-raoa-aaoa">
    section 2.15
   </a>
   for a discussion of other
possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most aircraft do not have any instruments that give
the you a direct indication of angle of attack. Surprisingly,
many airliners and other aircraft that
   <em>
    do
   </em>
   have fancy angle-of-attack
sensors dont make the information available to the flight crew
 only to the autopilot. The bottom line is that most
pilots have to use a few tricks in order to perceive angle of
attack. We now discuss how this is done.
  </p>
  <p>
   It turns out to be easier to maintain
   <em>
    some
   </em>
   constant
angle of attack than to know precisely what angle of attack youve
got.
The strategy is summarized in the following outline.

   Trim for Angle of Attack!
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The simplest and best way to get the airplane to
fly at a constant angle of attack
   <a id="hevea_default132">
   </a>
   is to
   <em>
    leave it alone!
   </em>
   An airplane, by its very structure,
is trimmed for a definite angle of attack. The reason for this
is discussed in
   <a href="aoastab.html#sec-aoa-stability">
    chapter 6
   </a>
   . Even a dime-store
balsa-wood glider wants to fly at a definite angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   This concept is so important that it is the focal point of the first
lesson I give student pilots, who sometimes arrive with the
misconception that pilots must use great skill and continual
intervention to keep the airplane under control. I trim the airplane
for straight and level flight and then take my hands off the controls,
demonstrating that the airplane will fly just fine for quite a while
with no intervention at all. I emphasize a professional pilot does
not grab the controls firmly and move them quickly; a real pro grabs
them lightly and moves them smoothly.
   <a id="hevea_default133">
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   The second lesson is this: I trim the airplane for
a speed near
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    Y
   </sub>
   , straight and level. I then
roll the
   <a id="hevea_default134">
    trim
   </a>
   wheel back a little, which results
in a decrease in the trim speed. It does not result in a steady
climb. I explain that the trim wheel controls angle of attack,
and that airspeed is related to angle of attack. Trim for angle
of attack!
  </p>
  <p>
   To make changes in the angle of attack, you should
adjust the pitch attitude using pressure on the yoke, then trim to
remove the pressure, as discussed in
   <a href="#sec-change-aoa">
    section 2.6
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Configuration changes can affect the airplanes preferred angle of
attack. In a Cessna 152, 172, or 182, if you extend the
   <a id="hevea_default135">
    flaps
   </a>
   <em>
    while the engine is at a high power setting
   </em>
   or if you increase
the power
   <a id="hevea_default136">
   </a>
   <em>
    while the flaps are extended
   </em>
   it will cause
a nasty decrease in the trim speed. This is highly undesirable and
dangerous behavior. This means that when you perform a go-around, the
airplane tends to pitch up drastically and lose airspeed; to maintain
control you need to push on the yoke while you retract the flaps and
retrim. This pitch-up behavior is particularly treacherous because it
is not familiar. The
   <a id="hevea_default137">
    trim speed
   </a>
   changes very little if you
extend the flaps at low power settings, and/or change the power with
the flaps retracted, so if you havent recently performed many
go-arounds or similar maneuvers you might be in for a nasty surprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a typical Cherokee, extending two notches of flaps lowers the trim
speed ten or fifteen knots. This is discussed further in
   <a href="vdamp.html#sec-effect-of-flaps">
    section 5.5
   </a>
   and
   <a href="landing.html#sec-nasty-go-around">
    section 12.10
   </a>
   . Increasing
or decreasing engine power
   <a id="hevea_default138">
   </a>
   affects the trimmed angle
of attack only slightly. As discussed in
   <a href="energy.html#sec-change-throttle">
    section 1.3.2
   </a>
   ,
if you just reduce power the airplane should just descend. It should
not slow down appreciably; in fact it will probably speed up a little.
  </p>
  <p>
   An advanced lesson serves to demonstrate that constant
angle of attack is not quite the same as constant airspeed. When
the airplane is subjected to a high
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    G
   </span>
   -loading, as in a
steep turn, the trim mechanism causes it to speed up, so that
it can support the increased load at the same angle of attack.
This is important, since (as discussed in
   <a href="aoastab.html#sec-spiral-dive">
    section 6.2
   </a>
   )
it helps explain graveyard spirals,
   <a id="hevea_default139">
   </a>
   and why it
is a bit tricky to recover from them safely.

   Three Contributions to Angle of Attack
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to directly
perceive angle of attack. Fortunately, there are three other
quantities that can be perceived, and together they determine
the angle of attack. They are:
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">
    Pitch attitude, which is
defined
    <sup>
     <a href="#note24" id="text24">
      5
     </a>
    </sup>
    to be the
angle that the fuselage makes relative to the horizontal.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    Angle of climb
    <a id="hevea_default142">
    </a>
    , which
is just the angle between the flight path and the horizontal.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    Angle of incidence
    <a id="hevea_default143">
    </a>
    , which is the angle at which
the wings are attached to the fuselage.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   These quantities are related to the angle of attack
by a very simple formula:

Perhaps the simplest case is straight and level flight at
   <a id="hevea_default144">
    cruise
   </a>
   airspeed. In this case, the pitch attitude is zero, the angle of
climb is zero, and the angle of attack is equal to the angle of
incidence. Some more examples, with specific numbers for a typical
airplane, are included in

   Perceiving Pitch Angle
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   In straight and level flight you can control angle of attack by
controlling pitch attitude. You wont be able to pick a particular
angle of attack such as 6.37 degrees, but whatever angle of attack
youve got can be maintained.
   <sup>
    <a href="#note26" id="text26">
     7
    </a>
   </sup>
  </p>
  <p>
   There are at least four ways of perceiving pitch attitude. Perhaps
the best way is to use a mark on the
   <a id="hevea_default149">
    windshield
   </a>
   , as shown in
   <a href="#fig-perceive-pitch-front">
    figure 2.3
   </a>
   . The line of sight from your eye
through the mark makes a good pointer. (Try not to move your head up
and down too much.) If you cant find a scratch or bug-corpse in
exactly the right place, you can
   <em>
    make
   </em>
   a mark, or a pair of
marks, as discussed in
   <a href="snaps.html#sec-coordination-front">
    section 11.7.2
   </a>
   . It is even
simpler to rest your hand atop the instrument panel, holding the tip
of your finger in the right place, as shown in
   <a href="snaps.html#fig-hud-finger">
    figure 11.6
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Suppose you identify (or make) the mark when the
airplane is flying at the angle of attack that corresponds to
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    Y
   </sub>
   . Then if you re-trim for a higher angle
of attack
   <sup>
    <a href="#note27" id="text27">
     8
    </a>
   </sup>
   the sight line through that mark will point two
or three degrees above the horizon. Similarly, if you re-trim for
high-speed cruise, the sight mark will appear three or four degrees
below the horizon.

  <div class="center">
   <a id="fig-perceive-pitch-front">

   <a href="#fig-perceive-pitch-front">
    Figure 2.3
   </a>
   : Perceiving Pitch
Using The Forward Horizon
  </div>
  <p>
   The second way of perceiving pitch attitude also involves looking out
the front, but uses a sight line through a point on the
cowling
   <a id="hevea_default150">
   </a>
   . This is also
indicated in
   <a href="#fig-perceive-pitch-front">
    figure 2.3
   </a>
   . Be sure you chose a
point on the cowling directly ahead of your
dominant
   <sup>
    <a href="#note28" id="text28">
     9
    </a>
   </sup>
   eye; if your seat
is way over on one side of the airplane and you choose a sight mark on
the middle of the cowling, your sight line will be angled sideways,
which will mess up your pitch attitude perception as soon as you try
to bank the airplane. A Cessna 152 or 172 has a bolt on the cowling,
directly ahead of the pilot, that makes a good sight mark.
  </p>
  <p>
   A sight mark on the cowling
   <a id="hevea_default151">
   </a>
   has the advantage that it is farther away from your eye,
so it is easier to keep both it and the horizon in focus at the same
time. The disadvantage is that the sight line constructed this way
sometimes points quite a ways below the horizon. This means the angle
you are trying to perceive  the angle between this reference line
and the relative wind  is larger. Given some definite amount of
change, it will manifest itself as a small-percentage change in
something that was large, or as a large-percentage change in something
that was small to begin with. The latter is usually easier to
perceive.
  </p>
  <p>
   One advantage of using the cowling as a reference is
   <em>
    permanence
   </em>
   .
That is, the cowling is in the same place on all airplanes of that
make and model, whereas marks on the windshield will not. A second
advantage is that it is
   <em>
    less awkward
   </em>
   than using your finger.
The big disavantage of using the cowling crops up during turns, as
discussed in
   <a href="snaps.html#sec-coordination-front">
    section 11.7.2
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The third way to perceive pitch attitude is to observe
the angle between the wing and the lateral horizon, as shown in
   <a href="#fig-perceive-pitch-lateral">
    figure 2.4
   </a>
   . On a high-wing airplane,
the bottom surface of the wing makes a good reference. In
particular, on a Cessna
152 / 172 / 182, the bottom surface has a rather large flat section,
which makes an ideal reference  and this reference is
very nearly aligned with the horizon at cruise angle of attack
(in level flight).
  </p>

   <a id="fig-perceive-pitch-lateral">
   </a>
   <a name="fig_perceive_pitch_lateral">

   <a href="#fig-perceive-pitch-lateral">
    Figure 2.4
   </a>
   : Perceiving Pitch Using The
Lateral Horizon
  </div>
  <p>
   On a low-wing airplane, you typically have to use
a little more imagination to use the wing as a reference pointer
 but it is definitely possible and definitely worth the
effort. Sometimes it helps to envision the chord line with your
minds eye. If you control the angle between the chord line and
the lateral horizon, you are controlling pitch attitude.
  </p>
  <p>
   The idea that you can control pitch attitude while looking out the
side
   <a id="hevea_default152">
   </a>
   window is very
important. Aerobatics pilots often attach
crosshair-like pointers to their wings, just so they can be sure to
have an easy-to-use pitch attitude reference when theyre looking out
the side. Conversely, it is common to find students who (although
they can fly OK while looking out the front) lose control of pitch as
soon as they try to look out the side; this makes it tough to check
landmarks or scan for traffic. Also note that the view out the front
depends on various factors, such as whether your seat is adjusted high
or adjusted low ... whereas the view out the side gives a less
variable, more reliable perception of pitch angle.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">
   <blockquote class="quote">
    This is worth practicing. Since you will be emphasizing the side
view, take along an instructor or at least a trusted safety pilot
who can check for traffic etc. by looking out the other side and
looking out the front. Trim the airplane for level flight, and
practice maintaining straight and level flight solely (or at least
mostly) by reference to the side view. Once every minute or so,
peek at the altimeter and the heading indicator to see how
you are doing.
    <p>
     Once you get the hang of straight and level flight, practice
some vertical-S maneuvers. That is, transition from level
flight to a 500 fpm climb. Climb for one minute, then level
off ... all by reference to the side view. Similarly practice
making 30 degree turns, left and right, all by reference to
the side view.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   <a id="hevea_default153">
   </a>
   The fourth way of perceiving pitch attitude is to use the attitude
indicator instrument  the
   <a id="hevea_default154">
    artificial horizon
   </a>
   . This has the
drawback that it is much too close to your eye; you cant look at the
attitude indicator and look for traffic at the same time. You should
use outside pitch references whenever possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: Most of the time, you are primarily concerned with
   <em>
    changes
   </em>
   in the pitch angle. That is, you dont usually need to know that the
pitch angle is 1.234 degrees, or any other specific value. If you
wanted to really quantify the pitch angle, you would have to decide
whether to measure it relative to the wing, relative to the cowling,
or relative to a mark on the windshield, et cetera ... but for
practical piloting purposes you dont need to quantify it. Usually
the more important thing is to perceive
   <em>
    changes
   </em>
   , and any or all
of the aforementioned references will work fine for that.

   Making Changes in Angle of Attack
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The push/pull motion of the yoke and the
trim wheel are part of the same system, jointly controlling the angle
of attack. They also jointly control airspeed, as discussed in
   <a href="#sec-ias-aoa">
    section 2.13
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want to make a temporary increase in angle of
attack, just raise the
nose by applying a little back pressure on the yoke. When you reach
the new pitch attitude, you can release most of the pressure, and for
the first few moments the airplane will maintain the new pitch
attitude. Then, as it
   <a id="hevea_default155">
   </a>
   slows down, you will need to maintain progressively more
back pressure in order to maintain the new pitch attitude (and new
angle of attack). After a few seconds things will stabilize at a new
pitch attitude, a new angle of attack, and a new airspeed. At this
point, if you release the back pressure, the airplane will want to
drop its nose so it can return to its trimmed angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you push or pull the airplane off its trim speed
and then suddenly let go of the yoke, the airplane will not return
smoothly and immediately to its trim speed; there will be some
phugoid oscillation (as discussed in
   <a href="aoastab.html#sec-phugoid">
    section 6.1.14
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   To
undo a temporary change in angle of attack, the proper technique
requires observing and controlling the pitch attitude. Let the
nose drop to the correct pitch attitude, then apply enough back
pressure to keep it from dropping farther. Then, as the airplane
gradually returns to its trim speed, you will need progressively
less pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Similar logic applies to making long-term changes in angle of attack.
Decide what pitch attitude you want. Use the yoke to obtain and
maintain that pitch attitude. At first, very little pressure will be
required to maintain the new pitch attitude. Then, as the airspeed
changes, use pressure on the yoke to keep the attitude where you want
it. Make the change permanent by using the trim wheel to trim off the
applied pressure. Dont lead with the trim.

   Lets see how these ideas apply to a typical maneuver: levelling
off
   <a id="hevea_default156">
   </a>
   from a climb. Initially lets suppose you
start out nicely trimmed, climbing at 475 feet per minute at 90 knots
true airspeed.
   <sup>
    <a href="#note29" id="text29">

   </sup>
   As discussed in
   <a href="#sec-perceive-wind">
    section 2.12
   </a>
   , that means
your direction of flight is 3 degrees above the horizon. As shown in
   <a href="#fig-level-off">
    figure 2.5
   </a>
   , the first step in the level-off is to change
your direction of flight so it becomes horizontal. During the brief
time that the direction of flight is changing, the aircraft will be
out of equilibrium; lift will be less than weight. The load on the
aircraft and its occupants will be slightly less than one
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    G

   .

   As the direction of flight changes, you will need to lower the nose
the same amount (three degrees). At this point, since the direction
of flight and the pitch attitude have changed together, the angle of
attack is (for the moment) the same as it was during the climb. This
can be seen by comparing the top two parts of
   <a href="#fig-aoa-change">
    figure 2.6
   </a>
   .
The airspeed is still 90 knots, which is the trim speed, so no yoke
force
   <a id="hevea_default157">
   </a>
   will be needed to maintain the new
attitude (for the moment). So far so good.

   Since the airplane is no longer
climbing, the engine power
   <a id="hevea_default158">
   </a>
   that had previously been
devoted to increasing the altitude is now being devoted to increasing
the airspeed. (See
   <a href="energy.html#sec-powered-power-curve">
    section 1.3.1
   </a>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   As the airplane gradually accelerates from climb speed to
   <a id="hevea_default159">
    cruise
   </a>
   speed, the direction of flight remains horizontal, so the pitch
attitude gradually decreases as the angle of attack decreases. This
is shown in the bottom part of
   <a href="#fig-aoa-change">
    figure 2.6
   </a>
   . You need to
apply progressively more forward pressure. In a trainer you might
trim off this pressure all at once, but in a high-powered airplane you
need to re-trim repeatedly, in stages, as the airplane keeps
accelerating and accelerating.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eventually, the airplane will reach cruise speed. At this point, the
airplane has all the altitude (potential energy) and airspeed (kinetic
energy) that it needs, so you should throttle back to cruise
power. Now
   <sup>
    <a href="#note30" id="text30">
     11
    </a>
   </sup>
   you make your final trim adjustment and the level-off maneuver is
complete.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is a useful trick: make a note of how much
   <a id="hevea_default160">
    trim
   </a>
   change is
required in your favorite airplane to make the transition from climb
to cruise. It is some definite amount, and remembering this amount
obviates a lot of guessing and fiddling.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="quote">
   I remember the amounts in
terms of sectors and bumps. That is, on most airplanes only
a certain sector of the trim wheel is exposed, and this defines how
much trim change can be achieved with a single hand motion; I call
this one sector. Similarly, the trim wheel typically features a
series of bumps, to make it easier to grasp. Each bump represents
1/4th or 1/5th of a sector.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Suppose after cruising in level flight for a while, you decide to
climb to a higher altitude. If you roll in three sectors of nose-up
trim as you start the climb, you can bet that you will need roll those
three sectors back out to return to cruise airspeed afterwards. Maybe
the right answer wont be
   <em>
    exactly
   </em>
   three sectors, because your
indicated airspeed at the new cruise altitude may be slightly
different. However, having some idea is better than having no idea! Apply
the expected amount of trim, see how it works, and then trim off any
slight yoke force that remains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Similarly, suppose you are cruising along and encounter
an
   <a id="hevea_default161">
    updraft
   </a>
   . If you roll in half a bump of nose-down trim to help
you maintain altitude, you can bet that you will need to roll
that half-bump back out when you exit the updraft and return to
normal airspeed. Keep track of the amount! Say to yourself,
Im carrying a half-bump of nose-down trim which Ill have
to get rid of sooner or later.

   Fly with a Light Touch
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Heres some really important advice: You should at all times be aware
of how much force you are putting on the yoke. You dont want to
accidentally pull the airplane off its trim speed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Usually this is summarized by saying keep it trimmed, and fly with a
light touch, but light touch is a relative concept, and
somewhat hard to quantify:

    <tr>
     <td align="left" valign="top" width="42%">
      Some airplanes have such heavy control forces that its difficult
to imagine anyone accidentally pulling the airplane off its trim speed.
You need to trim it properly lest you wear yourself out trying to hold
the yoke.

     <td align="center" nowrap="" valign="top" width="6%">
     </td>
     <td align="left" valign="top" width="42%">
      Many planes have such light control forces that if
you keep a tight grip on the yoke, you could easily pull the
airplane ten knots away from its trim speed without feeling it.

  </div>
  <p>
   In all cases, the important thing is to be
   <em>
    aware
   </em>
   of how much
force youre putting on the yoke.
  </p>
  <p>
   I once flew with a pilot who held the yoke so tightly that his
knuckles turned white, literally. Every time he looked to the right,
the airplane pitched down 10 or 15 degrees. Every time he looked to
the left, the airplane pitched up 10 or 15 degrees. Its a good thing
he didnt look to the left very long; otherwise we might have stalled.

      For almost any plane, from C-152 to Airbus, if you trim it
properly you will be able to fly most maneuvers using just your thumb

      <p>
       There are some exceptions; for instance the B-24 was notorious for its
heavy control forces. However, that just makes trimming even more
important.

   The yoke is not just a control carrying commands
from you to the airplane  it is also a valuable sensor
carrying information from the airplane to you. This is discussed
in more detail in
   <a href="landing.html#sec-light-touch">
    section 12.12
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   You should make sure the airplane is at all times trimmed for the
right airspeed (or, rather, angle of attack). You should be aware of
(and wary of) any force you apply to the yoke, forcing the airplane
off its trim speed.

   Trim Wont Solve All The Worlds Problems
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the airplanes tendency to return to its trimmed angle of
attack is very powerful, very important, and usually very helpful,
there is more to the story.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the airplane is disturbed from its trimmed angle of attack, it will
not just return; it will overshoot. It will oscillate a few times
before settling down. These phugoid
   <a id="hevea_default164">
   </a>
   oscillations are
slow enough that you can easily extinguish them by timely pressure on
the yoke, as discussed in
   <a href="aoastab.html#sec-phugoid">
    section 6.1.14
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In smooth air, you can trim the airplane and let it fly itself.
However, turbulent air will frequently provoke new phugoid
oscillations so you will frequently need to apply small nudges to the
yoke.
  </p>
  <p>
   For similar reasons, it is not normal procedure to
use the trim wheel to
   <em>
    initiate
   </em>
   a change in pitch attitude,
airspeed, or angle of attack. That would just provoke an oscillation.
Initiate the change with the yoke as described above. Put the pitch
attitude where it belongs, keep it there with the yoke, and then trim
off the pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, in some airplanes the trim speed is perturbed when you add
power, when you extend flaps, and especially when you have power and
flaps at the same time. See
   <a href="vdamp.html#sec-effect-of-flaps">
    section 5.5

   Pitch Attitude versus Angle of Attack
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The previous sections pointed out
that while pitch attitude and angle of attack are related, they
are not quite the same. Pitch attitude is measured relative to
the horizon, but angle of attack involves the direction of the
relative wind. In any situation where the relative wind is not
horizontal, we have to be careful.
  </p>
  <p>
   I forgot the distinction once; let me tell you the
story. One summer I spent several weeks at the Aspen Center for
Physics. This was my first opportunity to do any mountain
flying
   <a id="hevea_default165">
   </a>
   , so I arranged for a lesson from the
flight school at Aspen. The
lesson included flying over the continental divide and landing
at Leadville. Leadville is famous for being
the highest airport in the United States  9900 feet above
sea level. On the day in question, it was about 90
   <sup>
    
   </sup>
   F in the shade,
so the density altitude at Leadville was around 13,000 feet, and
I knew
   <a id="hevea_default166">
    takeoff
   </a>
   performance would be critical.
  </p>
  <p>
   I used my best short-field procedure, even though
the runway was 5000 feet long. I accelerated on the runway to
the proper climb-out speed (75 knots indicated, 90 knots true)
and then rotated to what I assumed was the correct climb-out attitude.
Based on my experience at lowland airports, I knew that 11 degrees
of nose-up attitude was usually just right for climb out. Following
my usual habit, I scanned the airspeed indicator after we had
climbed a few feet. To my horror, I observed that the airspeed
was decreasing rapidly. I immediately lowered the nose, and flew
the airplane in
   <a id="hevea_default167">
    ground effect
   </a>
   while it regained speed. (What
had been intended as a short-field procedure ended with a peculiar
imitation of soft-field
procedure.) I used up almost the entire
runway getting back to 75 knots. At 75 knots I rotated again,
choosing a much lower pitch attitude this time. We climbed out
at 75 K
   <sub>
    <span style="font-size:small">
     IAS

   </sub>
   and the rest of the lesson was relatively uneventful.

   <a href="#fig-takeoff-wrong">

using the normal pitch attitude does not produce the normal angle

is an indispensable part of the equation.

   Understanding what went wrong in this scenario is very
instructive. The main difference between a sea-level takeoff and a
mountain takeoff is that the airplane does not climb nearly so
steeply. The direction of flight is much more nearly horizontal. As
can be seen by comparing
   <a href="#fig-takeoff-wrong">
    figure 2.8
   </a>
   with
   <a href="#fig-takeoff-right">
    figure 2.9
   </a>
   , this means a much lower pitch attitude is
needed to achieve the same angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a id="hevea_default168">
   </a>
   The really embarrassing part of my story is that
I had actually calculated the climb gradient as part of my preflight
preparation, to make sure I could clear obstructions. I just didnt
make the connection between the climb gradient (which I calculated)
the best-climb angle of attack (which I knew) and the pitch attitude
(which I used for controlling the airplane). Fortunately I did know
the connection between airspeed and angle of attack, and I scanned the
airspeed indicator

   Power plus Attitude does not equal Performance
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   You may have heard the assertion that Power
plus Attitude equals Performance. Well, that assertion
is not quite right, and has caused all sorts of unnecessary
confusion.
   <a id="hevea_default170">
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Consider the following scenario: You are cruising along in a typical
180 horsepower, one-ton aircraft. You have constant power and
constant attitude
   <a id="hevea_default171">
   </a>
   , so you expect constant
performance. You do indeed get constant performance, and everything
seems just fine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, just raise the nose to a 15 degree nose-up attitude,
and hold that attitude as accurately as you can. You will once
again have constant power and constant attitude, so you might
expect constant performance  but that is definitely not
what you will get. Instead, you will get decreasing airspeed and
increasing angle of attack. The initial climb that looked so
promising will peter out and you will wind up on the edge of a
stall.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you think about this situation in terms of
   <em>
    energy
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    angle of attack
   </em>
   , the airplanes behavior is completely
predictable.
  </p>
  <p>
   First of all, we need to remember that not all climbs are steady
climbs. As portrayed in
   <a href="#fig-aoa-roller">
    figure 2.10
   </a>
   , it is possible for a
roller-coaster
   <a id="hevea_default172">
   </a>
   with no engine at all to
zoom
   <a id="hevea_default173">
   </a>
   up a little ways by cashing in its initial kinetic
energy. Just because it starts out on a certain climb trajectory
doesnt mean it can continue.

  </div>
  <p>
   Airplanes, too, can be placed on
   <a id="hevea_default174">
    climb
   </a>
   trajectories that cannot
be sustained by the available
engine power. The initial climb succeeds only because airspeed
is being cashed in to purchase altitude.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike a roller-coaster, the airplane will not stay
on its initial trajectory until it runs out of speed altogether.
As the airspeed decays, the airplane will have to fly at a higher
angle of attack in order to support its weight. Since, as discussed
above, the angle of attack depends on the angle between the pitch
attitude
   <a id="hevea_default175">
   </a>
   and the direction of flight, a
constant attitude implies a non-constant direction of flight,
as indicated in
   <a href="#fig-chandelle">

   : Constant Power &amp; Attitude
but Changing Performance
  </div>
  <p>
   If you are lucky, the changing flight path will result
in a trajectory where the rate of climb and the drag budget can
be sustained by engine power, with no further decrease of airspeed;
otherwise the maneuver will end in a stall.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the maneuvers you have to perform in order to get a commercial
pilot certificate is called a
   <em>
    chandelle
   </em>
   <a id="hevea_default176">
   </a>
   . As
discussed in
   <a href="maneuver.html#sec-chandelle">
    section 16.15
   </a>
   , it involves turning as well as
climbing, but if you disregard the turning part, the maneuver is
exactly what is portrayed in
   <a href="#fig-chandelle">
    figure 2.11
   </a>
   . This maneuver is
an important part of the syllabus because it forces people to learn
that constant power and constant attitude do not imply constant
performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   As discussed in
   <a href="#sec-change-aoa">
    section 2.6
   </a>
   , a pitch
attitude excursion is not necessarily the same as an angle of
attack excursion. Suppose due to turbulence or whatever, the
pitch attitude and direction of flight both increase by 15 degrees.
If you correct the situation promptly, the airspeed and altitude
will not have time to change much. If on the other hand you allow
the pitch excursion to persist, the airplane will begin to follow
the chandelle trajectory shown in
   <a href="#fig-chandelle">
    figure 2.11
   </a>
   . The
altitude will increase (at least at first), the airspeed will
decrease, and the angle of attack will increase. It is good pilot
technique to correct pitch attitude excursions before they turn
into altitude / airspeed / angle of attack excursions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To summarize: the Leadville scenario and the chandelle
scenario prove that angle of attack is far more important than
pitch attitude in determining performance. However, this does not
mean you disregard pitch attitude  far from it. I recommend
that you use pitch attitude
   <a id="hevea_default177">
   </a>
   as a
   <em>
    means
   </em>
   of controlling angle of attack
 just dont use pitch attitude as a
   <em>
    substitute
   </em>
   for controlling
angle of attack.

   More About the Power Curve
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   As mentioned in
   <a href="energy.html#sec-power-curve-intro">
    section 1.2.5
   </a>
   , the power curve is so
important that there is no good way to explain the details all at
once. Now that we know about angle of attack, we can use that to
better understand the power curve:
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The front side of the power curve corresponds to medium-low
angles of attack.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The mushing regime corresponds to medium-high angles of attack.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    The stalled regime corresponds to very high angles of attack.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   In particular, it is best to think of the power curve as two
functions: airspeed as a function of angle of attack, and rate of
climb as a function of angle of attack.
  </p>
  <div class="center">
   <a id="fig-power-curve-regimes:c">
   </a>
   <a name="fig_power_curve_regimes:c">

   <a href="#fig-power-curve-regimes%3Ac">
    Figure 2.12
   </a>
   : Power Curve  Three Regimes
  </div>
  <p>
   To say the same thing the other way: Looking at the axes of the
conventional power-curve diagram (as in
   <a href="#fig-power-curve-regimes%3Ac">
    figure 2.12
   </a>
   ) may tempt you to think of the rate of
climb as a function of airspeed, but this is not the smart way to
think about things. In particular, you cannot tell the difference
between the mushing regime and the stalled regime based on airspeed.
Instead, the smart approach is to tell the difference based on angle
of attack, as shown by the blue numbers in
   <a href="#fig-power-curve-alpha">
    figure 2.13
   </a>
   . Remember that airspeed can be used as an
approximate indication of angle of attack,
   <em>
    provided
   </em>
   the angle of
attack is not near or above the critical angle of attack. For more
about this approximation, see
   <a href="#sec-ias-aoa">
    section 2.13
   </a>
   .

   </a>
   : Power Curve  Angle of Attack
  </div>
  <p>
   Lets be clear: In normal flight, on the front side of the power
curve, it is OK to think of the rate of climb as a function of
airspeed. Indeed in most of the mushing regime (not too close to the
stall) you can think of the rate of climb as a function of airspeed.
However, if you want to understand the power curve as a whole,
including the stalled regime, you need to understand the whole
thing as a function of angle of attack. Both the airspeed and
the rate of climb are determined by the angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   The point at the boundary between the mushing regime and the stalled
regime has a number of special properties. The corresponding angle of
attack is called the
   <em>
    critical angle of attack
   </em>
   . The
corresponding airspeed is called the
   <em>
    stall speed
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   For a discussion of why the stalled regime of the power curve lies
below and to the right of this special point, see
   <a href="4forces.html#sec-coeff-force-power">
    section 4.5
   </a>
   and especially
   <a href="4forces.html#sec-lift-drag-model">
    section 4.5
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Warning about terminology: When pilots talk about the stall,
sometimes they are talking about this one point (i.e. the critical
angle of attack) ... but sometimes they are talking about the stalled
regime as a whole (i.e. any angle of attack greater than or equal to
critical). For a more-detailed explanation of what a stall is, see
   <a href="vdamp.html#sec-stall-intro">
    section 5.3
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not possible to maintain flight at an airspeed below the
stalling airspeed, but it is possible to maintain flight at an angle
of attack greater than the critical angle of attack.
This is discussed in

   Estimating the Relative Wind
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   As discussed above, to control the angle of attack
you need to know both the pitch attitude and the direction of
flight
   <a id="hevea_default178">
   </a>
   .
   <sup>
    <a href="#note31" id="text31">
     12
    </a>
   </sup>
   I have given several methods for estimating the
pitch attitude. Now it is time to explain how to estimate the
direction of the relative wind. This is almost the same thing
as estimating direction of flight.
  </p>
  <p>
   In level flight, the task is easy: The relative wind
is coming at you horizontally. (Again, I am assuming there are
no major updrafts or downdrafts.)
  </p>
  <p>
   If the airplane is climbing or descending, the origin
of the relative wind
   <a id="hevea_default179">
   </a>
   will be above or below the
horizon, respectively.
The amount above or below depends on the ratio of your vertical
speed to your airspeed. I have committed some of the numbers
to memory; for instance, I know that flying a standard 3 degree
glideslope at 90 knots involves a 480 fpm descent. Using the
same little fact in reverse tells me that if I am climbing out
at 90 knots and the
   <a id="hevea_default180">
    vertical speed indicator
   </a>
   (VSI) is reporting
480 fpm, I must be flying toward a point 3 degrees above the horizon;
to say it the other way, the relative wind must be coming toward
me from that point, three degrees above the horizon. That means
that I can relabel the VSI as a direction of flight
indicator, as shown in
   <a href="#fig-perceive-direction-vsi">
    figure 2.14
   </a>
   . Any
particular relabeling is only valid for one airspeed.

   If you maintain 90 knots and transition from level flight to a 480 fpm
climb, you will have to raise the pitch attitude 3 degrees in order to
maintain the same angle of attack.

   The VSI is not the only way of determining the direction of flight.
If you are established on an ILS
   <a id="hevea_default183">
    approach
   </a>
   , as long as the glideslope
needle stays centered you are descending at a known angle (usually
three degrees). Similarly, there might be a VASI or other approach
slope indicator that you could follow. As always, it is better
to use outside references instead of instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps the best way to judge the angle of descent is to use the
rule of
   <a id="hevea_default184">
    thumb
   </a>
    as discussed
in
   <a href="landing.html#sec-thumb">
    section 12.3
   </a>
   . That frees you from relying on any fancy
equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you control the direction of flight using any of these techniques,
and control the pitch attitude using the techniques discussed
elsewhere in this chapter, then you are also controlling the angle
of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   Actually, there is one more ingredient in this recipe: the wind.
Three of the methods just mentioned (VASI,
   <a id="hevea_default185">
   </a>
   electronic glideslope,
   <a id="hevea_default186">
   </a>
   and
rule of thumb) give you information about your direction of flight
relative to the ground, but the angle of attack depends on your
direction of flight
   <em>
    through the air
   </em>
   . In the presence of wind,
the two are not quite the same. This is discussed in
   <a href="landing.html#sec-aoa-wind">
    section 12.4.3
   </a>
   .
The scheme of estimating the direction of flight using the VSI
gives the correct answer even when natures wind is blowing (provided,
again, there are no major updrafts or downdrafts).
   <a id="hevea_default187">
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside references should be your primary means of controlling
angle of attack. Every so often you should look at the airspeed
indicator to make sure you have got the
   <em>
    right
   </em>
   angle of
attack (as discussed in
   <a href="#sec-ias-aoa">
    section 2.13
   </a>
   ), but you should
maintain that angle of attack by outside references.

    Airspeed versus Coefficient of Lift
   </font>
  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   So far in this chapter I have mentioned that the critical performance
numbers usually specified by airspeeds such as
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    Y
   </sub>
   are really angle
of attack recommendations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">
    I have mentioned that the trim wheel really controls
angle of attack but to a good approximation controls airspeed.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    I have mentioned that the airspeed indicator saved my bacon
when I had an angle of attack problem at Leadville.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Therefore you are probably beginning to suspect that
there might be a relationship between angle of attack and
   <a id="hevea_default191">
    airspeed
   </a>
   . Thats right! The purpose of this section
is to tell you why you can use the airspeed indicator to control
angle of attack, when you have to compensate for its imperfections,
and when you cant trust it at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   The basic line of reasoning is this: the amount of
lift produced by the wing depends on angle of attack and calibrated
airspeed. We can turn this around to get a simple relationship
between airspeed and angle of attack (assuming lift is known,
as it usually is). The key formula is

   You
dont need to calculate 
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sup>

   </sup>
   because your airspeed
indicator does it for you.
You may have thought that an airspeed
indicator would ideally measure the
   <a id="hevea_default204">
    <em>
     true airspeed
    </em>
   </a>
   (TAS), which is
simply the genuine speed of the air relative to the aircraft, denoted
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   in all the formulas. However, the airspeed indicator doesnt
even try to measure
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   (i.e. the square root of
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   ); instead
it tries to measure something called
   <a id="hevea_default205">
    <em>
     calibrated airspeed
    </em>
   </a>
   (CAS),
which is proportional to the square root of 
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   . Note
the factor of  in the CAS formula. Numerical
values for the TAS/CAS conversion factor, as a function of altitude,
can be found in
   <a href="power.html#tab-cas-tas">
    table 7.1

   .

   (IAS) refers to whatever is indicated on
your airspeed indicator. It is the same as calibrated airspeed, plus
whatever errors there are in the mechanism. This discussion assumes
that your instrument is not too wildly inaccurate, so that formulas
that apply to CAS exactly also apply to IAS accurately enough for
present purposes.

  <p>
   Now we bring in a new fact: The
   <a id="hevea_default208">
    coefficient
of lift
   </a>
   is a simple function of the
angle of attack. This dependence is shown in
   <a href="#fig-cl-aoa">
    figure 2.16
   </a>
   .
Note that for small angles of attack, the coefficient
of lift is essentially proportional to the angle of attack. The
angle of attack that gives the maximum coefficient of lift is
called the critical angle of attack and is marked
in the figure.

  <p>
   By combining this fact with what we already know, we can establish the
relationship between angle of attack and indicated airspeed. We
combine
   <a href="#fig-ias-cl">
    figure 2.15
   </a>
   with
   <a href="#fig-cl-aoa">
    figure 2.16
   </a>
   , as is done in
   <a href="#fig-ias-cl-aoa">
    figure 2.17
   </a>
   . We see that a particular
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   -number, such as
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    NE
   </sub>
   , corresponds to a particular coefficient of lift, which in turn
corresponds to a certain angle of attack. The same goes for most of
the other
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   -numbers, such as
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    Y
   </sub>
   . The argument works in reverse,
too: any particular angle of attack corresponds to a particular
airspeed (assuming we know how much lift is being produced).
  </p>
  <p>
   We conclude that the airspeed indicator is really a pretty good angle
of attack indicator  with one major exception: Near the stall,
there is a largish range of angles of attack that all produce nearly
the same coefficient of lift. (Thats because the coefficient of lift
versus angle of attack curve is quite flat on top, as shown in
   <a href="#fig-ias-cl-aoa">
    figure 2.17
   </a>
   .) This narrow range of coefficient-of-lift
values corresponds to a narrow range of airspeeds, all near
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    S
   </sub>
   , the
stalling airspeed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The stall is a very critical flight regime. This is a regime where
you would very much like to have an accurate instrument to indicate
angle of attack, but alas it is the one regime where the airspeed
indicator doesnt tell you what you need to know. A given airspeed
near the stall could correspond to one degree below the critical angle
of attack, or one degree above the critical angle of attack, and
looking at the airspeed indicator wont tell you which is which.
  </p>
  <p>
   You want to land the airplane at a very high angle
of attack. You will have to perceive the angle of attack using
outside visual cues, as discussed in the previous sections. During
the flare, the airspeed indicator doesnt tell you anything you
need to know. I once asked an airline captain to tell me at what
airspeed his airliner touched down. He said I dont know;
I never looked. Ive always had more important things to look
at. That was a good pilots honest answer.

    Correcting for Reduced Density

  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   In all non-stalling regimes of flight, including
(especially) final approach, the airspeed indicator provides your
most quantitative information about angle of attack. We now discuss
some corrections that may be needed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The airspeed indicator is basically a pressure gauge; the pressure
that moves the airspeed needle is the same dynamic pressure that holds
up the wings in accordance with the lift formula
(
   <a href="#eq-lift-key">
    equation 2.1
   </a>
   ). Knowing the pressure that holds up the wing
is more important than knowing your true airspeed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The airspeed indicator is doing you a favor by not measuring speed
   <em>
    per se
   </em>
   . It is telling you what you most need to know. Remember
that calibrated airspeed is what holds up your wings. In principle,
the calibrated airspeed depends on true airspeed and on density, and
the density depends on altitude, temperature, and humidity
... but the wing doesnt care about any of those details; it only
cares about the calibrated airspeed in accordance with
   <a href="#eq-lift-key">
    equation 2.1
   </a>
   . For instance, on final approach you should fly
the proper indicated airspeed. At high
   <a id="hevea_default210">
    density
   </a>
   altitudes this
will be a higher-than-normal true airspeed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words: do not correct
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V

   <sub>

   ,
   <span style="font-style:italic">

   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>

   </sub>
   ) for altitude or temperature. Trust the calibrated
airspeed. These speeds need to be corrected for weight
(
   <a href="#sec-weight-speed">
    section 2.13.4
   </a>
   ) but not for density altitude.
  </p>
  <p>
   The true airspeed that corresponds to any given calibrated airspeed
will be higher, by about 2% per thousand feet of density altitude.
Your
   <a id="hevea_default211">
    groundspeed
   </a>
   will also be greater.
  </p>
  <p>
   When landing at a high-altitude airport, the greater groundspeed means
you will need more
   <a id="hevea_default212">
    runway
   </a>
   length, by about 4% per thousand feet of
density altitude. Check the charts in your POH.
  </p>
  <p>
   A high-altitude takeoff is even worse than the landing, because the
engine (unless turbocharged) will be producing less power. Check the
charts in your POH. Apply a generous safety factor, since many of the
handbooks are disgracefully overoptimistic. Do the takeoff planning
(not just the landing planning) before you land, lest you go into an
airport you cant get out of.

  <p>
   So far we have been assuming the weight was equal to some standard
value. Lets relax that assumption and see what happens.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is easy to imagine flying a Cherokee Six at half of its maximum
legal weight. (See
   <a href="power.html#sec-weight-effects">
    section 7.5.8
   </a>
   for more on this.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The problem is that the Pilots Operating Handbook for the airplane
specifies all the critical angle of attack information in terms of
speeds  speeds that only apply at max weight. We know that the
airplane stalls at a definite angle of attack, not at a definite
airspeed or anything else.
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, if you keep the angle of attack constant and lower the
weight of the airplane by 10%, the airspeed needed to support that
weight goes down by 5%. This is because the lift depends on the
   <em>
    square
   </em>
   of the airspeed in
   <a href="#eq-lift-key">
    equation 2.1
   </a>
   ; the square
root of 0.90 is 0.95 and the square root of 1.10 is 1.05. For really
large changes in weight, the speed change is even somewhat greater;
the square root of 0.50 is not 0.75 but rather 0.707.
  </p>
  <p>
   At reduced weights approach speed and best-glide speed must be reduced
below their standard-weight handbook values, according to the square
root of the weight. The
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>

   </sub>
   and
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>

   values should be reduced by
approximately the same factor. The maneuvering speed must also be
reduced, although for different reasons, as discussed in

   Since the cruise speed depends mainly on power and parasite drag, it
hardly depends on angle of attack. That means it does
   <em>

    Correcting for Increased Lift Requirements

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   There is one fairly common situation where maintaining a given angle
of attack requires flying at airspeeds
   <em>
    above
   </em>
   the
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   -numbers
given in the Pilots Operating Handbook.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a steep turn, the wings are required to produce enough lift not
only to support the airplanes laboratory-frame weight, but also to
shove it around the corner. In a 60 degree bank, the lift requirement
is doubled. We say there is a
   <a id="hevea_default214">
    load factor
   </a>
   of 2.0. The airspeed
necessary to produce this lift at a given angle of attack is increased
by a factor of 2,
which is 1.41.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are going to use the airspeed indicator as a source of angle of
attack information, you have to take this into account. If you fly at
a speed near the bottom of the green arc in a steep turn, the airplane
will stall. For example, if the airplane stalls at 60 knots in
unaccelerated flight, it will stall at 85 knots in a 60 degree banked
turn (since 60 
1.41 = 85).
  </p>
  <p>
   Also remember that the airplane is trimmed for a definite angle of
attack, and it really wants to maintain that angle of attack. If you
are cruising along, trimmed for 120 knots in straight and level
flight, and the airplane gets into a 60 degree bank, it will
accelerate to 169 knots (120 times the square root of 2) in order to
meet the increased lift requirement at the same angle of attack. This
situation is described in more detail in
   <a href="aoastab.html#sec-spiral-dive">
    section 6.2

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   In a wide range of airplanes, it turns out that a good airspeed for
final approach is 1.3 times the stalling speed.
   <sup>
    <a href="#note36" id="text36">
     17
    </a>
   </sup>
  </p>
  <p>
   When applying this rule, a little sophistication is necessary, or you
might get into trouble. In particular, you must not just look at the
indicated stalling speed on the airspeed indicator, multiply by 1.3,
and then try to use the result as your indicated airspeed on final.
  </p>
  <p>
   The only safe way to calculate the approach speed is to multiply the
   <em>
    calibrated
   </em>
   stalling speed by 1.3, and then convert the result to
an indicated airspeed. That is, if you know the indicated stalling
speed, the correct procedure is:
  </p>
  <dl class="description">
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    <span style="font-weight:bold">

    <span style="font-weight:bold">
     c)

    convert this calibrated approach speed back to an
indicated airspeed you can use in the cockpit.
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
   <a href="#tab-calculate-with-cas">
    Table 2.5
   </a>
   shows an example which contrasts the
right and wrong calculations. The wrong calculation is typeset in
red, as a warning.
  </p>
  <p>
   The origin of the problem is this: It is possible to position the
   <a id="hevea_default219">
    Pitot tube
   </a>
   and static port
   <a id="hevea_default220">
   </a>
   so that the IAS
is a few knots higher than the CAS in cruise conditions, yet a few
knots lower
   <a id="hevea_default221">
   </a>
   than the CAS near the stall. Manufacturers
commonly do this, presumably in hopes of making pilots think the
airplane performs better than it really does. (In contrast, you will
probably never see an instrument that underestimates the top speed or
overestimates the stalling speed.)
  </p>
  <p>
   These errors would not be much of a problem if the the IAS were simply
proportional to the CAS. The constant of proportionality would drop
out of the calculation, and you could skip steps (a) and (c). Alas, in many airplanes the errors are highly nonlinear.
The indicated airspeeds are much too low at the low end of the scale.
If you multiply such a low number by 1.3, you get a number that is
still much too low, but falls at a place where the gauge is more
accurate, so you wind up with a real airspeed that is dangerously low.

   You may be wondering about other calculations, such as the corrections
for nonstandard weight. Should calculations also be done using
calibrated airspeed? The answer, alas, is not 100% obvious. It
depends on whether you think the errors in the system depend on
airspeed itself, or depend on angle of attack.
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">
    In the rather unlikely case that the error is in the gauge
itself, it would be better to convert to CAS, multiply, and convert
back to IAS.
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    More often, the airspeed instrument itself is a very accurate
pressure gauge, but the Pitot and static ports are positioned so that
they pick up bogus pressures at high angles of attack. In such a case
you should calculate the weight-correction using indicated airspeed
directly. That is, if you are at 64% of standard weight, your
indicated airspeed should be 80% of the standard indicated airspeed.
The point is that you want to fly the maneuver at the correct angle of
attack. If the errors depend only on angle of attack, they drop out
of this calculation.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   You might want to measure your airplane, as follows: Fly it at its
maximum weight, at a safe altitude, and observe the indicated airspeed
at which the stall warning horn comes on. Do this in the clean
configuration
   <sup>
    <a href="#note37" id="text37">
     18
    </a>
   </sup>
   and
in the landing configuration. Then repeat the measurements at the
lowest convenient weight. Then you will know for sure how the
indicated airspeed varies with weight, at particular angles of attack.

    Correcting for Slip
   </font>
  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   It is easy to get into situations where the indicated airspeed is
wildly inaccurate. In some airplanes the opening that is supposed to
measure the
   <a id="hevea_default223">
    static pressure
   </a>
   is located on one side of the fuselage.
During a slip, if that side is facing into the relative wind, it is
subject to some dynamic
pressure in addition to the static pressure.
   <sup>
    <a href="#note38" id="text38">
     19
    </a>
   </sup>
   This is not a small effect; I have seen the indicated
airspeed go to zero during intentional slips.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a slip (or any other maneuver) where the airspeed indicator cannot
be trusted, you must remember that it is angle of attack that really
matters. You can use the airspeed indicator if you wish
   <em>
    before
   </em>
   the maneuver to help figure out what angle of attack you want, but
   <em>
    during
   </em>
   the maneuver you must maintain that angle of attack by
looking at the angles themselves (pitch angle and direction of
flight). See
   <a href="snaps.html#sec-intentional-slip">

    Drag and Lift-to-Drag Ratio
   </font>
  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Lets return to the scenario of the airplane flying at half of its
standard weight
   <a id="hevea_default224">
   </a>
   , and ask (a) what
is the best glide speed, and (b) how well will it glide at that speed.
  </p>
  <p>
   To answer these questions we need to think about
drag as well as lift. (
   <a href="#sec-weight-speed">
    Section 2.13.4
   </a>
   concentrated
on topics like
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V

   and
   <span style="font-style:italic">

   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   which
depend on total lift, not lift-to-drag ratio
   <a id="hevea_default225">
   </a>
   .) Fortunately, the answer comes out the same. This is
because the formula for drag,

     )
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   has the same form as the famous formula for lift:

   <a id="eq-lift-famous">

   <a name="eq_lift_famous">

     )
    </td>

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The key idea is that the
   <a id="hevea_default226">
    coefficient of drag
   </a>
   depends
on angle of attack; at any particular angle of attack the coefficient does
not perceptibly depend on weight or airspeed. The same is true
of the coefficient of lift and the lift-to-drag ratio.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want to
   <a id="hevea_default227">
    glide
   </a>
   from point
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    A
   </span>
   to point
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    B
   </span>
   in no-wind
conditions,
   <sup>
    <a href="#note39" id="text39">
     20
    </a>
   </sup>
   the main thing you care about is
lift-to-drag ratio. For example, if your airplane is capable
of a 10-to-1 lift-to-drag ratio, then you can glide to a point
that is 1/10th of a radian (i.e. six degrees) below the horizon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The optimal lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at a definite
angle of attack. To support the weight of the airplane at that
angle of attack, you will need to fly at a speed proportional
to the square root of the weight, for the reasons given in
   <a href="#sec-weight-speed">
    section 2.13.4
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The lightly-loaded gliding airplane will have the
same angle of descent, the same direction of flight, and the same
total gliding distance, as indicated in
   <a href="#fig-weighted-glider">
    figure 2.18
   </a>
   .
The only difference is that it will have a slower descent rate
and a slower forward speed; this is indicated in the figure by
stopwatches that show how long it takes the plane to reach a particular
point.

  <p>
   The moral of the story is if you are flying a lightly-loaded airplane,
you should fly it by the
   <a id="hevea_default228">
   </a>
   numbers,
namely the angle of attack numbers. The critical airspeed numbers
(climb speed, approach speed, stalling speed, etc.) are all reduced
according to half the weight-change percentage. That is, if you are
10% light, reduce the handbook speeds by 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is one well-known exception to the rule of
thumb that says important performance speeds decrease as the weight
decreases. That is, the cruising speed actually increases at
reduced weights. This is not an exception to the real rule that
speeds should vary with weight
   <em>
    at a given angle of attack,
   </em>
   because cruising speed is not tied to a particular angle of
attack. If the airplane is lightly loaded, you can cruise at
a lower angle of attack and a higher airspeed, since the wings
need to do less work to support the weight of airplane.

   Some of the airplanes critical performance numbers depend directly on
angle of attack, while others dont. Its somewhat useful to know
which are which, so you can know which ones change with the weight of
the airplane and which ones dont.

    Explicit Airspeed Limits

  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a
   <em>
    normal-operations
   </em>
   airspeed,
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    NO
   </sub>
   . This is
indicated by the top of the green arc on the airspeed indicator. You
should not exceed this speed except in smooth air, and then only with
caution. The idea here is that you dont want to break the wing.
There is a maximum coefficient of lift, and the lift force depends on
this coefficient times calibrated airspeed squared. By limiting the
airspeed, you limit the maximum force that the wing can produce. This
is typically what determines
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    NO
   </sub>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   There is also a

   <span style="font-style:italic">

   </span>
   <sub>
    NE
   </sub>
   . This is indicated by the
top of the yellow arc, and by a red radial line on the airspeed
indicator. As the name suggests, you should never exceed this speed
under any circumstances. This limit depends on many things, including
drag force on the primary structure (wings, tail, landing gear etc.);
drag force on secondary items (antennas, fairings, etc.); instability
of the structure and control systems due to
   <a id="hevea_default231">

nasty complications.

  <p>
   If you are flying in moderate or severe turbulence, you should keep
your airspeed below the

    maneuvering speed
   </em>
   ,
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V

   is that
you want the wing to

may think that a stall is bad, but remember that you can recover from

  <p>
   We say it is
   <em>
    supposed
   </em>
   to stall, not guaranteed to stall, because
the formal definition of
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   takes into account only certain types
of rough control usage, and only certain types of turbulence (namely
purely vertical updrafts and downdrafts). In real life, other
possibilities must be considered. For instance, if you start out at
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   and fly through an arbitrarily intense wind shear, arbitrarily large
forces can be developed. For this and several other reasons, the
exact value of
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   should not be taken too literally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, the general idea of
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   makes sense: If you observe or
anticipate a situation that imposes large
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    G
   </span>
   loads on the airplane,
you should slow down and/or confine yourself to gentler maneuvers.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a id="hevea_default236">
   </a>
   Unlike
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    NO
   </sub>
   , the maneuvering speed varies in proportion to the
square root of the mass of the airplane. The reason for this is a bit
tricky. The trick is that
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   is not a force limit but rather an
   <em>
    acceleration
   </em>
   limit. When the manufacturers determine a value for
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   , they are not worried about breaking the wing, but are worried
about breaking
   <em>
    other
   </em>
   important parts of the airplane, such as
the engine mounts. These items dont directly care how much force the
wing is producing; they just care about the acceleration they are
undergoing.
  </p>
  <p>
   By increasing the mass of the airplane, you decrease the overall
acceleration that results from any overall force. (Of course, if you
increase the mass of cargo, it increases the stress on the
cargo-compartment floor  but it decreases the stress on unrelated
components such as engine mounts, because the acceleration is less.)
  </p>
  <p>
   This means you should put
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   along with
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    S
   </sub>
   and
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    Y
   </sub>
   etc. on
your list of critical airspeeds that vary in proportion to the square
root of the mass of the airplane. However,
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    V
   </span>
   <sub>
    A
   </sub>
   depends on real
   <em>
    mass
   </em>
   not on weight, so unlike the others it does
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   increase with load factor.
  </p>
  <p>
   To illustrate this point, consider what happens when the airplane is
in a steep turn. Compared to unaccelerated flight:
  </p>
  <dl class="description">
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    The stalling speed increases (because the stalling angle
of attack stays the same), and
   </dd>
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    the airspeed for best rate of climb increases (because the
optimum angle of attack stays the same), but
   </dd>
   <dt class="dt-description">
   </dt>
   <dd class="dd-description">
    the maneuvering speed remains the same (since it doesnt
directly depend on angle of attack).
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
   Finally, we should note that there are two different concepts that,
loosely speaking, are called maneuvering speeds.
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">

    The low-speed limits and most of the optimum numbers
(including the stall, best rate of climb, best lift/drag ratio, best

an excellent approximation, definite angles of attack. The
corresponding airspeeds vary in proportion to the square root of
weight
    <sub>
     lab

    times load factor. (To a second approximation each of
these angles of attack will change slightly because of propwash over
the wings, propeller efficiency, and other factors that depend on
speed and power.)

   Absolute versus Geometric Angle of Attack
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   You can skip this section unless you are trying to compare this book
with another book that uses a different definition of the angle of
attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   As mentioned in connection with
   <a href="#fig-aoa-def2">
    figure 2.1
   </a>
   , we are free to
choose how the angle-of-attack reference stick is aligned relative to
the rest of the wing. Throughout this book, we choose to align the
reference with the
   <a id="hevea_default240">
    zero-lift direction
   </a>
   . That means that zero
angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient of lift. According to
the standard terminology, the angle measured in this way is called the
   <em>
    absolute
   </em>
   angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some other books try to align the reference with the chord
line
   <sup>
    <a href="#note40" id="text40">
     21
    </a>
   </sup>
   of the wing. The angle measured in this way
is called the
   <em>
    geometric
   </em>
   angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you try to compare books, there is potential for confusion, because
this book uses angle of attack as shorthand for absolute angle of
attack, while some other books use the same words as shorthand for
other things, commonly geometric angle of attack. To make sense when
comparing books, you must avoid shorthand and use the fully explicit
terms. The relationship between the two ideas is shown in
   <a href="#fig-cl-abs-geo">

   -intercept of the graph of the coefficient of

  </p>
  <p>
   In this book, we always use the absolute scheme, so the
   <span style="font-style:italic">
    X
   </span>
   -intercept
is always zero.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also note that are many possibilities, not just absolute versus
geometric; the choice of reference is really quite arbitrary. It is
perfectly valid to measure angles relative any reference you choose,
provided you are consistent about it. (Aligning the reference stick
with the
   <em>
    fuselage
   </em>
   is useful in some situations; see
   <a href="vdamp.html#sec-flaps-washout">
    section 5.5.3
   </a>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the chord as a reference works OK if you are only talking about
one
   <em>
    section
   </em>
   of a
   <em>
    plain
   </em>
   wing. On the other hand:
  </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
   <li class="li-itemize">
    On typical airplanes, the chord of the wing tip is oriented
differently from the chord of the wing root. Which one should be
considered the reference?
   </li>
   <li class="li-itemize">
    When you extend the flaps, the chord line changes.
(See
    <a href="vdamp.html#sec-more-rdamp">
     section 5.4.3
    </a>
    and
    <a href="vdamp.html#sec-effect-of-flaps">
     section 5.5
    </a>
    for more on
this.) Most books that choose to measure angle of attack relative to
the chord line violate their own rules when the flaps are extended,
and continue to measure angles relative to where the chord of the
unflapped wing would have been. That is illogical and creates
confusion about how you should use the flaps. This is one of the
reasons why it is advantageous to think in terms of absolute rather
than geometric angle of attack.

  </p>
  <p>
   Thinking about geometric angle of attack would be advantageous if you
were
   <em>
    building
   </em>
   an airplane, or conducting wind-tunnel research on
wing sections. Engineers can look at a wing section and determine the
geometric angle of attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast, if you are
   <em>
    piloting
   </em>
   the airplane, geometric angle
of attack has no advantages and several big disadvantages: its hard
to define, its hard to perceive, and it doesnt tell you what you
need to know anyway! We care about coefficient of lift, which is
proportional to absolute angle of attack over a wide range (i.e. not
too close to the stall). Each degree of angle of attack is worth
about 0.1 units of coefficient of lift.
  </p>
  <p>
   The simple rule pitch plus incidence equals angle of climb plus
angle of attack (
   <a href="#fig-incidence">
    figure 2.2
   </a>
   ) is always mathematically
valid, no matter what reference youre using to measure angle of
attack. (Thats because the arbitrariness in the angle of incidence
cancels the arbitrariness in the angle of attack.) However, if you want
the rule to be
   <em>
    useful
   </em>
   in the cockpit, especially in situations
where flap settings are changing (as discussed in
   <a href="vdamp.html#sec-effect-of-flaps">
    section 5.5
   </a>
   ), you need to focus on absolute angle of
attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a point of terminology: In the aeronautical engineering literature,
the angle of attack is almost universally represented by 
(Greek letter alpha). We mention this so that if you ever hear people
talking about alpha this and alpha that you will know they are
talking about angle of attack.

glossing over the distinction between horizontal
speed and total speed. The tables tabulate the tangent and arctangent,
based on true horizontal and vertical motion. In a really steep
dive, the airspeed indicator would indicate the total motion,
which is the resultant of the horizontal and vertical components.
If you really wanted to calibrate the angles against the VSI
and the (total) airspeed, you should use the sine and arcsine.
However, at any halfway reasonable angle, the difference is less
than a percent or two. Dont worry about it.
