         </strong>
         A bad breakup
        </strong>
        can be one of the most traumatic things youll ever go through.
       </p>
       <p>
        Its often been compared to a life-threatening illness or a terrible car accident that can leave you and your life completely devastated.
       </p>
       <p>
        You might even find yourself wondering if youll ever recover, and there will be days when it seems pretty hopeless . . .
       </p>
       <p>
        And thats because a bad breakup doesnt just mean you have a broken heart. It often means youve had to break up your family, your home, and everything youd hoped for in the future that you and your former partner planned together.
       </p>
       <p>
        A breakup can turn your whole life inside out.
       </p>
       <p>
        And even if you have a sense that someday youll get past it and be okay . . . as the months (or maybe even years) go by, worry starts to creep in and you begin having thoughts like:
        <em>
         Am I just meant to be alone? Could someone else really fall in love with me? Will I ever feel whole and fulfilled and happy again?
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        So, the real question is . . .
       </p>
       <h2 style="text-align: center;">
        How Can You Find The Light At The End Of The Tunnel
        <br/>
        When YoureTrapped In Grief From A Breakup?
       </h2>
       <p>
        <img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-227 alignleft" height="375" src="http://evolvingwisdom.com/consciousuncoupling/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stock-beach.jpg" style="margin-right: 30px;" width="250"/>
        Whether youre in a breakup right now or have suffered one in the past . . . you may still be stuck in a frustrating limbobetween the familiar life you had before your breakup, and the life you now face that is filled with unknowns,that you might not know how to fully step into.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes this limbo is only a minor and temporary discomfort, but it could be a sign of something more deeply-rooted: a repetitive, unconscious pattern that continues to sabotage everything you do to try to find love and joy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, for some, getting stuck in this kind of breakup grief can be like that terrible car crash they suspect they will never recover from. Theyfeel broken, and scarred for life.
       </p>
       <p>
        And whether your grief ranks as something closer to a mild fender bender, or is the kind of crash no one walks away from undamaged . . . all heartbreaks require some treatment  and the greatest tragedy in all of this is that most have gone untreated, and for far too long.
       </p>
       <p>
        None of us want that experience for ourselves or for our children, or for any other members of our family who might be impacted.I also believe that none of us truly want that for our partner either, no matter how bad things have been between you.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The problem is that weve all been taught to end our relationships in ways that often guarantee just these kinds of painful results.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        If youre like any of the thousands of people Ive taught or coached, youre probably no stranger to what Im talking about. And if you consider the way youve handled breakup pain in the past or how youre handling it right now, you may . . .
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Feel confused as to why life has brought you this kind of pain and disappointment.
        </li>
        <li>
         Spend days just going through the motions, feeling numb or lost.
        </li>
        <li>
         Find that the pain keeps resurfacing and a deep loneliness is beginning to set in, even though you might still have great friends and a life that used to make you happy.
        </li>
        <li>
         Be afraid that your breakup has scarred your children.
        </li>
        <li>
         Feel angry, betrayed or confused as you try to release your old vision for the future  your home, lifestyle, and family  in spite of your best efforts to move on with your life.
        </li>
        <li>
         Find that your friends dont understand why youre still hurting . . . so on top of losing your partner, you may now feel under-supported by them, too.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        If youre having any of these challenges or residual experiences, I want you to know
        <strong>
         youre not alone . . . and its not your fault
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        If youre like most people suffering breakup grief, you may feel as though you were pushed blindly into an extremely painful situation. You were probably given no tools or skills for how to navigate it, and more often than not you were encouraged to make devastating mistakes in the way you handled and processed the breakup, leaving you feeling broken and helpless.
       </p>
       <p>
        So rather than transitioning out of the old and into the new . . . you got stuck somewhere in-between
        <em>
         .
        </em>
        And that broken or wrecked feeling might have stayed with you because you never had the chance to heal your heart properly.
       </p>
       <p>
        And . . .
       </p>
       <h2 style="text-align: center;">
        Theres Only One Way To Truly Free Yourself
        <br/>
        From The Vicious Cycle Of Painful Breakups
       </h2>
       <p>
        <img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-228" height="166" src="http://evolvingwisdom.com/consciousuncoupling/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stock-seed.jpg" title="" width="250"/>
       </p>
       <p>
        You must break the pattern that is the source of the suffering in your life . . . instead of allowing that pattern to break your heart (which it often does . . . over and over again).
       </p>
       <p>
        And the first step to breaking that pattern forever is to properly complete your relationships of the past, and to
        <strong>
         treat your broken heart with the same care and attention
        </strong>
        you would give anything else that was broken in your body.
       </p>
       <p>
        And just like a broken leg, if a broken heart isnt set properly it will never fully heal, and youll go through life with a heart that doesnt work quite right, is defensive, closed-off, and easily bruised. The hearts equivalent of walking with a limp for the rest of your life, and feeling pain every time it rains.
       </p>
       <p>
        And though its not always comfortable for me to talk about it, I know all too well what that feels like. Ive suffered that kind of heartbreak, and it wasnt until I discovered the
        <em>
         Conscious Uncoupling
        </em>
        process that I fully healed my limping heart and broke my pattern of one painful breakup after another.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before then, it was a different story:
       </p>
       <h2 style="text-align: center;">
        At One Point, For Me, Breaking Up Meant
        <br/>
        I Gained 50 Pounds And Cried For 3 Years
       </h2>
       <p>
        As most women can attest . . . when we grieve, we tend to grieve with our whole body.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I broke up with my first boyfriend in high school, I was so traumatized that I actually gained 50 pounds. And then I cried over him for 3 years and dreamed about him for another 20.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I broke up with another boyfriend years after that, I started smoking again. Then I practically stopped eating or sleeping for an entire year,and felt so much despair that nearly half my hair fell out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Humiliated and ashamed to be single again, I isolated myself and stopped socializing for months.
       </p>
       <p>
        And with each new breakup,
        <strong>
         I found myself
        </strong>
        <strong>
         stacking the pain
        </strong>
        . In other words, I began creating all these ugly meanings about how each breakup proved that I wasnt worthy of being loved, or that men would always disappoint me.
       </p>
       <p>
        You might have chosen ugly meanings from your breakups, too . . . telling yourself things like:
       </p>
       <div class="meanings">
        <ul>
         <li>
          <em>
           Love is something other people get to have but not me.
          </em>
         </li>
         <li>
          <em>
           Im just not meant to be happy in love.
          </em>
         </li>
         <li>
          <em>
           Im not successful/skinny/good/fun enough to deserve love.
          </em>
         </li>
         <li>
          <em>
           All the good ones are taken; the rest are a waste of time and will just let me down . . . again.
          </em>
         </li>
        </ul>
       </div>
       <p>
        I told myself some of the same things.
       </p>
       <p>
        But eventually I realized something that changed everything for me. I
        <br/>
        realized that the reason the pain was so significant and so overwhelming,
        <br/>
        was because . . .
       </p>
       <h2 style="text-align: center;">
        What I Thought Was A Broken Heart
        <br/>
        Was Actually A Re-Wounding Of Something
        <br/>
        That Had Broken In Me A Long Time Ago
       </h2>
       <p>
        <img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-229" height="166" src="http://evolvingwisdom.com/consciousuncoupling/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stock-butterflies.jpg" title="" width="250"/>
       </p>
       <p>
        I had to admit that these breakups were bringing me face-to-face with a core wounding  an
        <em>
         original source fracture
        </em>
        inside me. I had to accept the fact that on an unconscious level, Id entered into these relationships to heal a deep secret pain within me that had been there a very long time.
       </p>
       <p>
        And that made me
        <em>
         so angry
        </em>
        to have that core wound ripped open once again. In fact, I felt betrayed by my former partner, because the one person who was supposed to fix this core wounding forever (him), had instead re-wounded me. And now here I was, suffering that horrible pain all over again.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         It wouldnt be until decades later that Id heal all that pain  and in a way that truly surprised me: through
         <em>
          another breakup
         </em>
         . . . a breakup unlike any other before it.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        If youre at all familiar with me and who I am, it is likely because of my bestselling book and companion online course,
        <em>
         Calling in The One: 7 Weeks to Attract Your Soulmate.
        </em>
        I used that process myself to call in a wonderful man named Mark, and our relationship was beautiful, kind, and sacred.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I discovered during my time with Mark, and what many of us discover in our relationships, is that sometimes a beautiful, perfect relationship is for a purpose and for a time . . . and not always forever  even though that might have been the hope or aim when the relationship began.
       </p>
       <p>
        And so, after 10 years of a largely fulfilling married life, and much consideration, we both decided that the arc of our relationship was complete.
       </p>
       <p>
        At first, it was all hard for me to admit, and accept . . .
       </p>
       <p>
        I was terrified that it meant I would have to suffer the disappointing, somewhat embarrassing and even humiliating experience of ending my marriage to the man who had made
        <em>
         Calling in The One
        </em>
        possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         What would people say?
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        But there were other fears, too.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had no idea how to recreate my life as a single mom . . . how to tell our friends and all my students and clients. And at the age of 53, I wondered if Id be able to find love again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strange as it sounds, although Id helped thousands and thousands of people find love, I wasnt completely positive that Id be able to do it again . . . and I think we all feel that way to some extent when our relationship is ending.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         But then something amazing happened . . .
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Though I was grieving the loss of our relationship, I noticed that I wasnt feeling shattered. I didnt start beating myself up or sinking into self-loathing . . . nor did I want to do anything destructive to myself or to Mark. There was no out-of-control rage or obsessing over what I should or shouldnt have done, and no desire for revenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead
        <strong>
         ours was an incredibly loving, caring and contained experience
        </strong>
        . We were mindful of each other and what we were doing, and we created a loving space of understanding for our daughter, which was so important to us.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were awakening to a new way of separating, and the special way we completed our relationship amazingly allowed both of us to also heal our heartbreak from past relationships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Best of all, we both quite quickly felt ready to love and be loved by someone new . . . and we were able to welcome the new loves we called into our lives fairly quickly, as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        In these ways, we have continued to be able to experience our family not as broken, but rather as evolved and expanded.
       </p>
       <p>
        And now I have this beautiful life-long friendship with Mark, who writes me notes of gratitude for being such a gift in his life. I also have a new bright, good-hearted man in my life who my family has embraced and welcomed . . . and our daughter is doing well and has a great relationship with both of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mark and I have both continued to excel along our individual paths towards our greatest contributions to the world, which is deeply important to both of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        And within this entire experience, I discovered how a breakup could actually be a healthy and beautiful process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I share all of this with you, because I want you to know that I recognize the deep, shattering and all-encompassing pain breakups can cause. But I also know that we can complete our relationships in a very different way, with quite beautiful results.
       </p>
       <p>
        The end of your relationship doesnt need to be a painful breakup. It can simply be a completion, and it can also be a wonderful transition into the next stage of your life . . . and your next relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the
        <em>
         Conscious Uncoupling

        process . . .

       </h2>
       <p>
        I want you to know that I didnt set out to become a breakup teacher, and the whole idea of becoming one didnt appeal to me at first. I wanted to just keep teaching people how find true love.
       </p>
       <p>
        But then something else happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of my
        <em>
         Calling in The One
        </em>
        students wrote to me, wanting to understand how my wonderful marriage could have ended after 10 years . . . and once I told them the story, some of them began asking me for advice to help them engage in necessary endings with love, care and healing. And in the process of trying to do that, I realized I owed it to them to create this course and make it available to everyone who was suffering (or had suffered) through a painful breakup.
       </p>
       <p>
        And as I started sharing the
        <em>
         Conscious Uncoupling
        </em>
        process with friends, clients and students, and began to see their immediate success in using the process, I realized clearly that
        <strong>
         none of them had to bear that kind of trauma in their lives . . . and neither do you.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        And thats why I want to share this process with you now. If youre suffering breakup grief or the lasting scars of a past breakup that might be sabotaging your efforts to find and enjoy love, I want to help you make a smooth and painless transition into your new, magnificent life over the next 5 weeks . . . and then into the new, best-yet love that is waiting for you in the not-so-distant future.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the course, Ill give you the precise steps to take, teach you the skills you can develop, and introduce you to the powerful rituals you can engage to transform this time of heartache and disappointment into a healing, liberating, and eventually even joyful experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        And once your grief is properly healed . . .

        Youll Immediately Feel More Joyful And At

       <p>
        Youll find that the obstacles youve encountered around every cornerat work, in your creative endeavors, in your relationships with your children, family and friendswill simply fade away and allow you to move forward without so much resistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        And youll not only feel these benefits right away, youll also be ready and able to truly attract the right person into your life for your next love relationship. The person who will be a match to the very best, healed version of you.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want you to realize that your new love doesnt begin when you meet your next partner . . .
       </p>
       <p>
        It begins right now, today, with how you say goodbye to the person youre with (or were with months or years ago).
       </p>
       <p>
        And you can only truly begin to change your life, in this very moment, by understanding that relationships role in your development, and learning the lessons from itabout what you want and what you need, and about who you are and how you can be the best partner you can be in your next relationship while inspiring your former partner to do the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if it doesnt feel like it right now (and Im sure it doesnt), the shattering breakups youve endured can actually bring wisdom and light into your heart and into your world if you just follow that shattering down to the place of your deepest wounding and heal your source fracture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your original source fracture is the place where you created those mistaken beliefs when you were young: the beliefs about who you are, who others are, and what is possible for you in life and in love.
       </p>
       <p>
        And when you choose to face those mistaken beliefs, you can then make different choices and commit to living your life in alignment with your deeper wisdom and inner guidance . . . and you can heal.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can finally, correctly, and permanently re-set that original break, and heal your heart so that its actually stronger than its ever been!
       </p>
       <p>
        There is truly no reason for you to have to continue to suffer and be unfulfilled because you see your life as so broken.

        The 5-week course left me feeling hopeful, emotionally adventurous, peaceful, optimistic and centered. It lifted the heavy black shroud of fear of the future that I had been wearing for a very, very long time. It helped me to take responsibility for my contribution to his discontent. This was huge!

        I thought I had given that relationship the best of meall the love I had inside to give, all the communication skills Id learned. I had put my truest vision of love fulfilled with all of my heart on the line, and it had failed. I worried that I would deaden and fade inside. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Instead, I found a joy and aliveness that I didnt even know existed in me. I felt more awake than I had ever felt, and I learned to love myself in a way no one else ever had!

        I cant imagine how my life would be if I hadnt done this course. The shifts in my way of thinking and relating to my ex were so instant, theres no way I could have worked through my inner turmoil so quickly on my own. It got to the bottom of exactly what was going on for me and gave me the tools to dig myself out of the gutter and create the life I know I deserve!

        Attending the

        5-week Course left me feeling that I was not wrong to care for my ex and the welfare of our children, and helped me to see that choosing to set a caring partnership as the end state of the divorce was indeed a Conscious Uncoupling!

        The

        Course has helped me to know I am responsible for my own life and the people I let into it. That is incredibly freeing! I cant imagine what things would be like now if I hadnt taken the course and learned what I did. I will never self abandon or over give every again. I have spent a lot of money on courses and books in the last few years and this course was by far the most effective and the most positively life changing!

        Because I have been able to consciously uncouple with honor and respect, remaining at my highest self, I have no regrets and nothing that is holding me back. My children are starting to blossom, we live in the house of our dreams, and I found work after being a stay-at-home mom for 18 years. My life has been filled with miracles!

        Before the course, I believed that my only chance for love and happiness had just died at my own hand and that the scar of failure would stay with me for life. I saw no other way to look at the situation, and felt that healing for me would be, at the most, a distraction from the pain. The actual experience was like watching colour TV for the first time. What was really true was simply out of my own perceptual field. This course taught me how to see and understand the truth and the truth set me free!

        Completing the course and listening to the seminar helped to give a structure to my life that was missing. I felt very misunderstood by others who would constantly tell me to just get over it and move on, which I found really difficult to bear. The

        process helped me to just be with myself and the process of grieving. I finally felt understood without being judged or shamed!

        I have begun to find a new relationship with my ex husband who I will continue working with in a 50/50 business partnership, as well as to co-parent our daughter. Now, rather than holding back as we were in our marriage, we are giving, listening, striving for understanding, and recognizing that when an emotion comes up, it is simply something we need to look at!

            Every parent cringes when hearing the scary statistics on how poorly many children do in the aftermath of divorce and separation. Fears of potentially subjecting our children to poor school performance, nightmares, bed wetting, psychological problems and/or behavioral problems are often enough to keep us in relationships that we might otherwise have long ago left behind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, is it divorce itself that is so disturbing to children? Or is it the no-win double binds that children often find themselves in during these complex and confusing transitions? Is it that we parents are often so filled with our own pain, so blinded by our own righteous anger, and so fearful of losing the love we counted on, that we unconsciously pull on our children in immature, toxic and unfair ways, failing to help them navigate their loss in a way that would bring cohesion and wellbeing to their lives?
           </p>
           <p>
            All of us want to do right by our kids, and find a way to give them everything theyll need to be strong, healthy, resilient and resourceful in the face of lifes challenges. Join us, as internationally respected parenting expert and family therapist Susan Stiffelman gives us the tips we need to keep it simple, safe and sane for our children during divorce  typically a time when life is anything but simple, safe or sane!

        While there are many great teachers of wisdom doing good work in the world, Katherine brings a particular brilliance that few can duplicate. Her ability to move deeply into the center of suffering and use it to catalyze a genuine shift is nothing short of miraculous. Having had the privilege of working with her these past seven years, I can only say that I know of no one more qualified than she to lead you through this dark night of the soul and help you find your way back to happiness, health and love.

        Few teachers can inspire us to use heartbreak as a catalyst for awakening in quite the same way that Katherine is able to do. With deep wisdom and heart, Katherine lovingly takes us by the hand and guides us through the evolutionary work of consciously completing a relationship with dignity, grace and honor so that we might, once again, find our way home to love.

        The process of mindfully and consciously uncoupling is radically evolutionary work! Katherine has created a way for us to change the form of our relationships while keeping the love intact. This process preserves and protects the wellbeing of our children and ensures that we are empowered to move.
