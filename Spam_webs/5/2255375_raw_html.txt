         "I have worked with Vitae for the past 2.5 years. The support that Vitae has offered when working on a particular project has been excellent, delivering a small choice (my request!) of 'good' candidates, no time wasters. Vitae has been able to 'get under the skin' of our brand, and deliver each time we work with them. Also, I appreciate that they do not constantly pester me, as they know and understand how I work, which suits me completely!"

         "I have worked with Vitae since around 2008 and have found their approach to be both refreshing and consultative. Many agencies I have worked with try to 'sell in' candidates who are not right either technically or culturally which results in a waste of time for all parties. Vitae's approach and in depth understanding of my team, and the calibre of individual that will fit within it means that they deliver the right people consistently. If they haven't got someone they feel is right, they won't send them. In my experience this is what stands them apart from the rest."
