         <em>
          For a long time, Canadians have felt safer than Australians, who have maintained a more hard-nosed sense of the risk of danger. This attack in Ottawa will generate a profound shock to Canada's sense of identity, writes John Blaxland.
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia and Canada are the two countries that in many ways most resemble each other. Both are similarly sized, new-world, federal, bicameral, and multicultural Westminster parliamentary democracies.
       </p>
       <p>
        They're both open societies that have taken pride in their civil liberties and freedoms - characteristics that have made them extraordinarily attractive for migrants from around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both are also currently governed by conservative prime ministers outspoken in their support of US efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. One could say they are virtually
        <a href="http://www.mqup.ca/strategic-cousins-products-9780773530355.php" target="_blank" title="">
         strategic cousins
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        But for a long time, Canadians have felt safer than Australians. Sitting next to the United States, Canadians have tended to maintain their defence force as a defence against help from an overbearing neighbouring 'uncle' Sam.
       </p>
       <p>
        In contrast, Australians have tended to work hard to pay alliance dues, fearful that the 'uncle' would otherwise lose interest in the country's security concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        America's aid in the war in the Pacific from 1942 onwards has long resonated in Australia. Similarly, the threat from extremist jihadist groups has given Australians a greater sense of wariness, notably since the bombings in Bali and Jakarta which targeted Australians. As a consequence, Australians have tended to be tolerant of more intrusive security measures from the state and federal security authorities than their Canadian counterparts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Symptomatic of their sense of optimism and being immune to such targeting, Canadian backpackers have for generations sewn maple leaf flags to their bags, not only to distinguish themselves from Americans but because of their sense that nobody really has wanted to harm them. So Wednesday's shooting at Parliament House in Ottawa can be expected to generate a profound shock to Canadians' sense of identity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, in contrast, has maintained a more hard-nosed sense of the risk of danger. Security measures at Parliament House in Canberra, for instance, are considerably more robust than in its namesake in Ottawa. In part, that is because Ottawa's majestic but far-older Parliament House was not built with such security measures in mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it also reflects the fact that Canada's counterpart to ASIO, known as CSIS, has always struggled to get the same level of acceptance of its security concerns than has its Australian equivalent.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia, the recent raising in alert levels on the advice of outgoing ASIO Director-General David Irvine generated relatively little controversy and now appears vindicated, given that this is exactly the kind of incident the raised alert levels appear to have been aimed at preventing.
       </p>
       <p>
        So should we be more concerned now than ever? Of course. But just as we are careful to look both ways when we cross a road, and put our seat belts on when driving in a car, we should keep these additional security concerns in perspective.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's security authorities at state and federal level are competent professionals. They have already been put on heightened levels of alert. We should appreciate the work that they do and get on with our lives, mindful that in Australia many more people die in road and other accidents than from terrorist incidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond that, we should reflect on how we foster and nurture our open, multicultural society. We should seek to understand what it is that motivates so-called 'lone-wolf' extremists to take the steps they take and work at mitigating strategies in the community. We should reflect further on what it is that we value and how we not only preserve it but prevent the toxic spill-over from hatreds in other parts of the world from taking root in our open societies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, we should also be careful to avoid responding with fear and loathing. It is easy, for instance, to caricaturise Muslim migrants in a Norman Lindsay-esque portrayal of latent evil (his picture of the bloodthirsty Hun of 1914 springs to mind). This would be extremely counterproductive, generating the opposite effect to the one we should be seeking.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a danger of a knee-jerk reaction of anger, fear and hatred. John Dickson, from the Centre for Public Christianity, put it best when he talked about

           When we went to Iraq we signed up for at least half a century.

           The middle east had already emerged in the west.
           <br/>
           Canada is yet another country that will be forced to play a part.
           <br/>
           At some stage we either have good sense prevailing or a catastrophe.
           <br/>
           We and Canada want the former but must prepare for the latter.

                 People die all the time. Police are killed on regular intervals. It is nasty but that danger goes with the job.

                 That figure is nonsense Yank. And, incidentally, in the real world men are as commonly victims of domestic violence as women. But men are much less likely to report it.

                 Actually it was reported today that the figures is over 200,000. doesn't matter if it is women, children or men. What matters is how many resources the government is willing to put towards a very real problem.

                 A poor argument on your part, yank. The number of domestic violence victims requires greater resources to fighting domestic violence, not less to fighting terrorism. You do not ignore one threat just because another threat is bigger.

                 Yeah good point yank.  I've been saying this for ages.  Domestic violence, rape, murder, child abuse it's mind numbing the extent to which those crimes go on.  Terrorism on the home front pales in comparison (though vigilance is still a good idea).  Why aren't there resources being ploughed into DV and other nasty crimes...they're acts of terror also.

                 An Australia woman is killed every week by her partner. Yet do we see 800 police knocking down doors to save them?

                 Tell the families of the 2 police wounded in Victoria it is a supposed threat. Tell the family of the guy doing his job at a Canadian War Memorial it is a supposed threat. I have family members in the police force and your comments are disgusting, you have no idea of the huge amount of time every copper puts into domestic violence cases. We could put ten thousand more coppers on the beat and domestic violence will continue, it and Ice are the real scourges of our society right now. Take a deep breath Yank, this was very ignorant and very insulting to many.

                 I agree the police are expending large amounts of time and effort investigating and attending DV incidents.   Resources which could be deployed elsewhere.  The problem is DV legislation keeps being amended and each time the bar is lowered to the point where almost any domestic dispute can be labeled DV.  Only an estimated 30% involve physical violence.  The rest in many cases are what are low level disputes. Which could be handled better by other means.

                 Yes yank, governments win votes, or hope they do, with lots of chest thumping about the evil people who wish ALL Australians harm.

                 <br/>
                 There aren't any votes in domestic violence prevention. Politicians for the most part just go 'tut-tut' because spending money on it isn't considered to be vote-worthy.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Imagine if the government reduced the purchase of the Joint Strike Fighters from 58 down to 50? That would save more than 1.6 billion. Then imagine the uproar from the vested interests!

                 I disagree.  States governments coming up for election make capital out of DV and they and the Federal government are throwing buckets of money at DV prevention.

                 Indeed, DannyS.    The sellers of the Joint Struck Failure are interested in only one thing - how much loot they can extract from the dumb-bunny Australian decision-makers and other losers.

                 <br/>
                 These carpet-baggers don't give two hoots that the opportunity-cost of the JSF is measured in such things as effective domestic violence reduction programs .... wider anti-terrorism training .... and, for that matter, dirt-cheap dread-provoking massively-destructive ground attack aircraft.    They don't care - and they don't have to care.   Unless there are truckloads of money in it for them - they are not obliged to show the slightest interest.

                 Come on, Yank.  Your argument is illogical. Violent spouse's are not supported and inspired by a dangerous radical global network that have murdered many thousands, and will continue to do so if left unchecked.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I can assure you, if police had intelligence indicating the imminent murder of a spouse they would be 'knocking down doors to save them'.

                 That could create quite a fuss.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 12% of all murders (and 15% of all murderers) are indigenous, while females represent 70% of all murdered indigenous people (compared to less than 50% of other women).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So a very large number of those door-knockings by police would be in indigenous doors.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I can just hear the howls of outrage at such police racial profiling.

                 I'm absolutely on your side, Yank, regarding our freedoms versus security. Even if we had several 9/11 magnitude incidents in Australia, as terrible as that would be, that would still be less than ten thousand victims ... no good if your loved ones or yourself are among the victims, I grant, but a risk I for one am very willing to live with. I can't see that sacrificing ones freedoms to try to ensure safety is in any way worth it. The freedoms we've enjoyed in Australia were fought for at a considerable price for many over the centuries during which they evolved and, once they are given up, they will not be returned in a hurry, or perhaps in our lifetimes. Besides, I have a very strong suspicion that we are being deluged with propaganda from most of the Western governments, the U.S. government principally, and absolutely including the Abbott government. One can't help but feel that so much scare-mongering over recent times is designed precisely to persuade us to relinquish our freedoms for the benefit of corporations and governments, which have become subservient to those interests. As Benjamin Franklin put it: "They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."

                 Bring back the White Australia Policy.  Lets get back to a simpler time when we didn't have to worry about all these Muslims.         Buuuuut, those Irish Catholics were a bit of a worry back then, and they looked more like us.  Oh Dear.  And aaaand  and  they had real Stalinist Communists then, not these mamby pamby lefties.   What can we do??????

                 This is not a case of quivering in our boots! It is about looking at the risk factors and evaluating reasonably.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 When you get in a car do you put on a seatbelt? Do you indicate when turning? Do you give way? Do you stop at red lights? If yes (and I hope so) Then you are taking known precautionary steps to try and (to the best of your ability, as you never know) limit your chance of causing or being the result of a fatality.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It is not whether its going to kill you, its about being prepared and informed in a way that limits the chance. Just as is happening here!
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 We should not all hide under our beds as you seem to think people are (btw, they aren't) But we should remain informed about the situtation and all the risk factors, ALL of them. Its not about whether you care, yank, its about informing the community.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Just as we are so aware of domestic violence figures (which btw, look up the additional funding at federal/state level just this year, as well as the LNP policy in place before you say nothing has happened) and workplace death figures, and shark attacks, and car accidents, we should be aware of the risk here. It is not different. You deciding this one doesnt affect you does not mean the information should not be out there for people to consume.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Your assumption most people are blind fools that run and hide whenever people say 'boogeyman' is not in touch with reality.

                 It's interesting that the Left get so worked up seeking out and inventing petty infractions for attitudes allegedly against the 'progressive' program like Winkgate and Woolies T-shirtgate and he/shegate, and in doing so this hateful mob demonises good people over nothing, yet when it comes to a world religion/culture that militantly and crudely challenges everything they believe in they are nowhere to be seen, except to say that criticism is racist, and tolerance and concessions will make the problem go away. The Left must discard the dumb harmful visions and start again with ideas grounded in reality.

                <p>
                 Let me put this into perspective for you - I have been keenly watching news constantly over the last couple of months and here is what I have gathered:
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 - 800 police raid all over australia due to a communication 'chatter' that we still don't know anything about, but from the word 'chatter' I wouldn't think it was too serious.
                 <br/>
                 - one person charged from that with giving some money (i think it was $15k or something) to his brother
                 <br/>
                 - all others that this operation were released. PM 2 days later passes new security laws saying there are massive threats.
                 <br/>
                 - a man meanwhile gets killed while being taken to a melbourne police station. PM uses this to say he was an extremist while in Hawaii, I don't know but seems a bit premature to say that- shouldn't he wait for some kind of investigation or something?
                 <br/>
                 - PM says he knows of 100 people here that went to fight overseas. Not sure why he doesn't do anything about them but instead puts through these security laws?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Here is by the way a measure of our governments competence:
                 <br/>
                 - PM also says security threat so great we need to drop boxes of weapons throughout iraq.
                 <br/>
                 - our defence minister just today said our weapons may have fallen into the hands of ISIS, hooray big surprise.
                 <br/>
                 - PM says absolutely no boots on the ground
                 <br/>
                 - Bishop says 200 boots will be on the ground. Whoops.
                 <br/>
                 - Meanwhile PM sends our super hornets over to iraq to bomb them, we help kill 533 people so far, including women and children according to our own intelligence. What? Who are we bombing and why are we bombing civilians?
                 <br/>
                 - And get this: we used to hate Assad, Syria's PM, only 3 months ago. Now we support his actions against isis. Who are we fighting again and why?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I'm looking at this and nothing adds up and we are making a dog's breakfast of it all. Enlighten me with more clear facts, but this situation is messy messy messy. What's more, it is clear this Liberal government is incompetent.

                 I stand up to them by preaching tolerance and respecting people of all races and religions and most of all by not being kowtowed or made scared by them why because I know terrorists lose all power when you refuse to be terrorized .

                 <br/>
                 When Governments get terrorized and introduce laws to curtail our freedoms because that's what the terrorists want to curtail our freedoms the terrorists have won .

                 These nut jobs care not if you are scared of them or not muzz, they will still kill you mate simply because you are not like them and won't sign up to drink their Kool, Aid. They see us all as Unbelievers, Apostates, Infidels and corrupt.

                 You are free to tolerate it but I for one, will not and will stand up to these cowards and bullies and call out the Leftists currently running a protection racket for them.

                 Funny, no-one was that scared when Roxon floated some of these measures in 2012. Told her to get stuffed. But now big, bad, scary IS pops their heads up and it's illegal to report on intelligence operations. And the government wants 2 years of your metadata history on record.

                 Every day somewhere in Australia,  someone dies, is terrorised,  is harmed  by users of drugs, abusers of alcohol.Where is the same level of outrage,of alarm?Where is the pressure on the alcohol industry to contribute to the cost to the nation.
                 <br/>
                 Watch this weeks 4 Corners  to get a sense of some of the harm that is being done.
                 <br/>
                 The fact is in Australia Catholics have caused more harm to Australians than Muslims.We must keep some proper perspective in all this.

                 Ho hum, another terrorist attack out of the blue. Another failure of intelligence. Or not.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The negotiator between the US and Iraq in 2001 knew for months that there was going to be an attack in New York by terrorists. She says so herself.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So it makes you wonder what goes on with these intelligence people. And WMDs, that caused us to go to war in Iraq, was what ? They know stuff they don't tell us, they make stuff up? Pardon my growing cynicism about the whole thing.

                 I kinda feel the same - let them all go to Syria and Iraq. Maybe put a GPS locator on their luggage and then put a smart bomb on it once they arrive. But the truth is, these people are our problem - it isn't fair to dump them on the Iraqis and Syrians. They have enough problems.

                 The real threat of ISIL is that it has in effect given every psychopath any where in the world a cause they can adopt. And there are a lot of psychopaths - they make up a few percent of the population. Al Qaeda kinda had "higher standards". ISIL represents a more accessible Jihad, less discriminating in those who can jump on the bandwagon. Jihad for dummies. That is the secret of their success and is the reason why this snowball will keep rolling for a while.

                 Yeah. And remember when the West couldn't get enough of those guys? They were taking on the Soviets. We gave them money and guns and looked the other way when they murdered and tortured. The M/E, the Americas, Africa - we didn't care when the faces they did it to were black or brown, or they didn't speak English. Now, the same loons are gunning for us and it is 'save us, save us! How could these terrible people exist?'

                 Another case of someone having their passport taken off them.  Look how well that works out.  It's no coincidence that the "War on Terror" ramps up only during the years of conservative governments.

             I find what people are saying about cars being more dangerous than terrorists amusing. Of course cars are more dangerous, because most Australians interact with them every day. They are a necessity of life, and every year billions are invested in making them safer.

               Careful Cmac1 - you might actually be introducing logic into your argument! As is implied by your posting, cars (or course) do not kill people - and in most cases, I would suggest, their drivers who do, do not do so intentionally - though interesting to note the recent incident in Canada with the alleged radicalised Islamist mowing down a soldier (I think). On the other hand, Jihadists (and of course others) who threaten in the fashion under discussion, do represent a threat - they are not some object without will (like a car) which may end up causing a death, but some ONE (not the difference, Yank)  who has the potential to inflict that harm.

                 By the way, stop being disingenuous, nobody at all denies climate change.  What a lot of us do deny is man-made climate change.  recently, a Swdish climate scientist has successfully replicated Murry Salby's finding that it is the rise in tempratures that drive the increases of CO2 in the atmosphere. That destroys the 'consensus view.'

             Watch the rhetoric - the LNP taking advantage of a tragedy (yet again) for political gain.  Great to take the attention off domestic matters and hey, might score a few votes.  Win win...

           Perhaps this incident will silence the critics of our present governments increased security measures, unfortunately not I expect, I suspect that they (the critics) would rather have a major terrorist incident than admit that they are wrong.

             If the Abbott Government didn't increase security measures these people would be complainnig about that too. At the end of the day it wouldn't matter what this Govt did they would insist on the opposite view regardless. This is why their views have no credibility.

               Sadly I think you are right, Luke. If Abbott mentioned that it was bad to eat babies then this lot would soon have a range of recipe books out. Opposing just for the sake of opposing an individual is a good way to lose credibility with the very people that you are trying to talk to.

             No security system in the world can guard against a lone assailant.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Nor is the Canadian incident 'major' in any sense other than public spectacle. One death in an insecure area, and the assailant was stopped as soon as they entered a secure facility.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             This incident, 20,000km away, is neither a justification for Australia's present security level, nor an excuse to raise levels further.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It is a sad event, and a tragic one, but put it in context of all other deaths and attacks (such as domestic violence) in Canada today, its significance is driven by the media attention, not the act itself.

                 John, your belief of expert appears to be someone agreeing with you.
                 <br/>
                 At no stage Craig claimed to have security experience.  Whilst I agree with the perspective it dosnt mean Craig has any expert knowledge at all.  Nor does it mean I do.

               @Craig - I agree this is not a major incident in terms of the number of deaths. It is a sobering thought, however, that some Canadians can be so disenchanted with western society that they will drift towards extremist outfits like ISIS.   And it is doubly unfortunate that the symbol of Canadian democracy and rights, Parliament itself, should come under threat from some yahoo with a grudge against the world.

                 Frangipani, some people are just evil. I have had a little exposure to forensic psychiatry, and what I learned changed my world view. A few percent of people will always be inclined this way - especially young men. You cannot produce a society free of these people, although you can produce societies that produce relatively fewer or more. But it is degrees. All you can do is ensure that the community has sufficient mechanisms to protect itself from these people. These people are the greatest threat to us as a species, you only have to look at the history books to see that. And as technology advances ,the threat they represent increases.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Two things worry me. Firstly, these kinds of personalities are strongly on the rise, particularly in certain parts of the community. But what worries me more is that in the Western world over the last few decades is that we have effectively handed over all responsibility for protection from these people over to the State, and ultimately, this will fail. The community needs to be more involved again, and also needs to be less tolerant of these personalities. There is an attitude that these people are the purely a problem for our police and internal security forces to solve - and to be honest, this is an attitude our security forces and politicians like to promote, because it empowers them. But they can't solve all the problems these people present, and never will. Not without creating a police state. And even police states fail at managing these people. In fact, police states produce these people at higher rates and these people have a habit of rising to the top in these systems.

                 While I agree that a small percentage of people in any society wiill exhibit sociopathic tendencies, I've got no idea why you state 'these personalities are strongly on the rise (sic)'. While I can't stand requests in comment sections state that people on another side of an argument 'publish their research', I'm going to ask it anyway as it's such a broad statement, and if true has significant implications. Is there any data to support your statement? What is unarguably on the rise is the number of young, male, middle class local-born Islamic extremists. Research into this is desperately needed. I'm guessing it's a combination of disenfranchisement and arrested emotional development in some young Muslim men, along with often low intellect. I believe  the reasons for the phenomena will be found in an examination of the psychological development of these people within their families, subcultures and Australian society. Personally, I feel that these men become extremists as a defence mechanism to deal with their deep seated, often subsconcious dissatisfaction with their lives - a dissatisfaction that finds its expression in doing things like fighting for ISIS. Growing up in a family environment of patriarchy, patrongage-based or tribally- driven notions of what it takes to be successful are antithetical to Australian cultural norms, a near guaranteed way to achieve not much in life and a cause of  the exrremist's inner conflicts.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Islam I believe is a side-issue in all of this, and while it readily lends itself to an interpration that supports the extremist's worldviews and behaviours, it's not 'the cause' but rather something like a catalyst, one that is instituionally and structurally unable to deal with such misguided interprations.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If we were to understand and critique Arab/middle-esastern cultlure, and in particular the role and significance of family and tribal units, we'd be more likely to come up with solutions to the problem of Islamic extremism. I won't hold my breath: debate in this country is sunk to the level of trivia - like the wearing of the burqas and ugly and primitive racism (whose exponents, perversley seem to be emotionaly and intellectually arrested in a similar way to extremists. We absorb ourselves in these comparative non-issues becase a more complex, deeper analysis would be highly challenging.

               The Canadians have admitted that, had the intruder correct information, he could have killed about half of the sitting parliamentarians.  He walked past the rooms in which these people were meeting.  Whether you believe that life would be improved by killing the majority of the Liberal parliamentarians, the possibility that it might occur is not just a media issue.

               I agree. This was one lone individual with a mental illness. Hardly the evidence of some enormous terrorist "plot". The people who are calling it so have now become the conspiracy theorists.

                 And I don't agree.  There doesn't have to be a huge organized plot for something to be an act of terrorism.  A lone wolf or two is still a terrorist if his actions are driven by a particular ideology and his intention is to threaten the security and stability of the state.  Shooting up Parliament certainly fits the second half of he equation;  his motives for doing so will determine the first half.

                 The word "terrorist" is a political word used to create negative change in our societies, promote the reduction of individual freedom and underwrite massive war exercises against innocent people abroad. Smart people know that the odd mentally ill person occasionally goes off the deep end for one reason or another. We don't traditionally call them terrorists because NORMALLY we don't attach this evil political agenda to them. Or are we just going to label Martin Bryant a "terrorist" now and put him in a field so we can drop a bomb on him with a drone?

                 @Aussie Sutra - I must say, this discussion about the usage of the word, "terrorist" is getting rather tedious.  Where I come from, the word has been used at different times to describe, quite accurately, Sons of Freedom Doukhoubors, Sikh Free Kalistan activiists, the violent fringe of the Quebec separatist movement, Tamil Tigers and those bankrolling them, extreme environmentalists, and Islamofascist groups.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The word is an accurate description of these groups, their aims and their methods - all using violence against the community and/or the state to pursue their political objectives, however loosely defined.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Terrorism has been an accepted tool of extremists since at least the 19th c, with Nechaev and his ilk.  It exists.  Get over it.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 What matters is determining how to deal with individual terrorists effectively without endangering the civil liberties of all of us.  Pretending they don't exist at all is the easy way out.  Answering hard questions about the level of risk we have to be prepared to accept in order to live in a free society is the hard one.

             Unlikely. In fact, I'd almost guarantee that we'll soon hear a chorus of left-wingers who will claim that:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             1. The attack was real and an inevitable product of our foreign policy;
             <br/>
             2. The attack was a false-flag by the CIA/Mossed/NWO; or
             <br/>
             3. The police knew the attack was coming and allowed it to occur for reasons sinister.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Some might even claim all three at the same time. What they won't say is the truth - namely, that they value their personal liberty over the lives of others.

               Zing : 1. Even a 'lefty' like myself cannot see a connection between our foreign policy and the attack on the Canadian Parliament. Maybe, it is their foreign policy that contributed to this idiots reasons for the attack but alas like you I doubt I am in a position to make that or any other claim of what happens in Canada.

               As far as 2 and 3 are concerned, well, I would suggest those points are just a product of some nutter's imaginings. Just who again is your source.

                 I agree with you.

                 The article says that the gunman had been in prison on drug matters. It indicates that he was converted there.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The consequences of that could be to imprison fewer on drug matters and/or do NOT put them together with people who'd convert them. Thirdly, in this world people who have been in prison have practically no chance for employment and become loose cannons, lone wolves, or bikies. They need a 'home' and some find it in religion.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 That's the analysis, whether we can put fewer people in prison, segregate them, or find employment and a 'home' for them after they get out is another matter.

                 @Blax - I'm not sure the info about the man's background is entirely correct.  His father is, I believe, an Algerian Canadian, and Bibeau spent some time in Libya, so his interest in Islam may go back further than that.  Also, although he's got a record, he only spent 60 days in jail on one drug offence, and a day in jail for uttering threats, which seems a little short for a conversion.  He does seem to have had long-term drug issues, and perhaps some mental health issues as well.  I don't know what you do with these guys, though:  our systems simply aren't designed to cope with someone who  might or might not someday present a threat.

                 @Aussie Sutra - no, the state won't cope with the random acts of a lone mental case. It should, however, be able to cope with hate crimes, and I'd say this was one.

                 Sorry. Mental illness calls trumps. When a mentally ill person kills ONE person with a gun, that is a tragic act. It is not a "terrorist attack".

                 I know of no rule or definition that says a terrorist must be someone with no mental health issues, that he must operate as part of an organized group and not independently, and that he must kill more than one person.  A terrorist is someone who uses violence to attack the community or the state.  I would certainly put a deliberate attack on the Canadian Houses of Parliament in that category.  I find it mind boggling that there is any debate on the matter.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It is simply weasel wording to argue that an act of terrorism is not terrorism if the person is mentally ill.  An act of murder by a mentally ill person is still an act of murder, even though the mental illness may mean he is not legally responsible.  The same standard would apply to a terrorist who was mentally incompetent.  But the murder is still a murder.

                 If we suffer a terrorist attack, the odds that you will be the unlucky victim is a million to one. The odds that someone else will die is a virtual certainty.

                 It's easy to make a wager when you're playing with someone else's stake. If you're going to gamble my safety for the sake of your liberties, it's only reasonable that I gamble your liberties for the sake of my safety.

                 Yes I appreciate that. It's Pascal's wager.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It's not the costs that concern me; despite the fact that every dollar spent is a dollar not spent on kids with cancer in hospitals, supporting disenfranchised and easily radicalised youths, building sovereign wealth etc.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But when the sanctity of protecting innocents runs up against the sanctity of the tenets of our civilisation and liberal democracy, we need to be very careful.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 No-one voted for these measures. No-one has demonstrated that they're fit for purpose. It's easy to see how they're fit for abuse. It's foolish to remove oversight and transparency for our employees in government; you wouldn't do such a thing in private enterprise that's for sure.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Safety is important, but would you be prepared to sacrifice ALL our civil rights to achieve a greater measure of it? You'll never be completely safe. But you can always be made a slave of the state.

                 Your civil liberties. Because if you don't have any, neither do I. I am not scared of terrorists. A greater threat, much closer to home, is a political class (both red and blue) who seem intent on controlling more and more facets of our lives. Not just mine; all our lives.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 As for the second question; the more I think about it, it is a profound question. I can't help but feel however that whatever answer I give I will be painted as either a completely inhumane and no better than the terrorists (for choosing my liberties over another's life) or as a hypocrite (for giving up my liberties in the first place). Seems I can't win. That said. Civil liberties. I will not live as a slave.

                 I think that a large number of young Australian men went to war and died so that you can live the life that you do.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You dishonour their sacrifice to give away the freedoms that they gave their lives for.

                 <br/>
                 They DID choose your civil liberties over their lives.

                 <br/>
                 Where's the critical understanding of how things really work these days? Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
                 <br/>
                 You CAN NOT trust ANYONE to tell you the truth when it is not in their interest, financially or politically to do so.
                 <br/>
                 We all know the need for intelligence. We also know that intelligence is used for nefarious and political purposes by those that wield the power. If we are to have the intelligence gathering, we MUST have a TRULY INDEPENDENT oversight. This is not the case at the moment.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 It's madness and I am afraid not for myself, not really for most people today, but for the future of Australia.

                 <br/>
                 Our soldiers died to uphold the territorial boundaries of Europe and South East Asia. It had little to do with the civil liberties of the average Australian in the street, especially since most of the liberties we have now didn't exist at that time.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The sacrifice of our soldiers was brave and worthy. But Australian lives were sacrificed for the sake of other nation's liberties, not for our own. That is what made the sacrifice so selfless.

                 Nicholas Higgins: as the grandson of a WW1 digger, I resent your assertion that all men who went to war would be opposed to the  security measures proposed - it is quite likely that many who died would support these measures. Simplistic assertions like yours add nothing to this discussion.

                 Patrick Henry
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But I don't think it's as clear an either or question as people want it to be it's not a choice of liberty and safety but community and observation
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Liberty isn't infinite freedom it's constrained by social norms always has been you are not at liberty to do a lot of things even our thoughts are pretty constructed by education and language ...I do not have fifty words for snow but I can probably use a lot of imprecise adjectives, there are foods, particularly meats I would have trouble eating because of cultural taboos but my conscious mind knows that this is training. My liberty has been set by early training and value sets that are as much given or inherited as by conscious choice.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 now that we love in big faceless communities the red flags of inappropriate behaviour are no longer dealt with by friends and family but by the state
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Then we get the whole who watches the watchmen argument.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If liberty was the issue then most of us would have been very comfortable with Brandis comment that people have the right too be bigots and the big issue over Prof Spurrlock would be why someone read his correspondence not what it contained.

                 They flouted social norms that we as a society are trying to change.

                <p>
                 In order to live in society we all give up our much of our personal liberty.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 You see personal liberty includes the right to do anything without any consideration of anyone else.  However, it is recognised that certain defined personal liberties should not be given up lightly. Freedom of speech, privacy, due process and freedom of association are the most important of these.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 However, the thing is that often speech or asscoaition occurs in connection with something else.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Defamation is a good example.  Defamation relates not just to the speech but to the intent to inflict reputational harm on another.  That is a deed.The same is true in relation to the old adage about falsely yelling 'fire' in a crowded cinema. The intention there is not to speak and impart information or opinion, but to cause harm. That is a deed.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So, I would suggest that none of the liberties we hold dear is being taken from you under the new terror laws.  These laws are aimed at deeds not at the specific liberties which you seem to be talknig about.
                 <br/>
                 But the ALP's proposed reforms to the anti-discrimnation laws would have been impingement on personal liberty, as is section 18C of the RDA. The reason for that is by making the offence subjective rather than objective, the ALP has attacked speech and not deeds.

               You seem to offer a lot of predictions based on your 'expert' knowledge Zing.  One incident in Canada justifies the recent legislation passed in our parliament.  This sort of piffle is something you are becoming renowned for and all from your apparent belief of sanctimonious righteousness.  I could just as validly argue that I expected this sort of comment from you but it means absolutely nothing.  But hey, you must feel comfortable spewing this nonsense because you keep putting it online. At some point in time someone will perpetrate a horror in Australia and the new laws will be shown to be powerless. But Abbott and company must be seen to be 'strong' when in fact it is nothing more than window dressing.  Sleep well tonight in your belief that Tony has made your world safer.

                 It's an interesting concept to suggest that no such things as false flags exist, or to try to marginalise those who point them out. Do you have a personal belief that all governments or groups are entirely truthful about their every action? Sounds gullible to me.

                 It's barely even an "incident". It's a shooting. And only one person killed other than the shooter. Those things happen with some regularity even in Canada.

                 @Aussie Sutra - actually, these things do no occur "with some regularity" in Canada.  And an active gunman inside Parliament?  That would be, I suspect, the first time that's happened in those buildings in 140 years.

               2 - All conspiracy theories have the US government in common.  In Australian politics it is always Abbott.  A lack of self responsibility or control is very ill fitting for anyone.

             "I suspect that they (the critics) would rather have a major terrorist incident than admit that they are wrong." Yes, at best their preferred method seems to be to shut the gate only after the horse has well and truly bolted. Though I really don't think any magnitude of terrorist attack would concern them unduly - other than a worry about a potential "backlash" to Islam. Their motives require a full article to analyse and expose.

             Yep, I was cynical but call me converted! When faced (like the Canadians) with the threat of a lone assailant with a firearm and a car, new laws cracking down on internet usage, travelling to Syria and journalists reporting on security agency blunders is the obvious solution. Well done Abbott government.

               Well, actually, both the shooter and the fellow who killed another Canadian soldier with his car two days ago had in fact had their passports pulled.  I expect they both could have committed a lot more carnage if they'd made it to Syria or Iraq.

                 I was aware that the first terrorist had his passport pulled but not the shooter. In any case though, that's nothing to do with the new laws. Australia was suspending passports well before the new laws came in, such as that of the clown who stabbed the AFP officers, the new laws only crack down on those who travel to Syria/Iraq once they get home and have to explain themselves.

                 @Dave - okay, slightly crossed wires on that.  I'm pretty unhappy with Abbott's proposals (certainly the journalist one) and I'm uneasy with a Canadian proposal to yank the citizenship of dual nationals who end up in the hot zone.  I don't regard pulling passports before people travel as being unreasonable.

                 I support the Australian government's pulling of passports off extremists, and I'm pretty concerned by criticism of the Canadian government for doing the same actually. There is a growing view within Canada that they should have let these guys go to Syria to do their killing. While being sympathetic to victims of terrorism, no it's not better that we allow our own citizens to blow up mosques full of Shiites in Bagdhad rather than stab an AFP officer here. I didn't and won't vote for Abbott but I'm pleased he hasn't tried to resort to the "let's just let them go".

                 The difference to many is that killing Iraqi's and Syrians is fine as they are not Australian/Canadian/(whatever your country is).

             Traveller, I would prefer to suffer a major terrorist incident than give up all of the freedoms I've previously enjoyed in this country ... not rather than admit that I'm wrong. To me, the foisting of heavy "security" laws on us is a greater act of terrorism than anythig the IS might threaten. Has it occurred to you that, as sad as events like the recent one in Canada (or even 9/11 for that matter) is, maybe our government with the assistance of many elements of the media are more than happy to take advantage of them to terrify us into giving up our liberties and our privacy? Who wants to live in a police state? It strips the value from one's life. I'm amazed how some people can put such trust in the government, especially in one that has lied to us as consistently as the present one.

             Silly comment. No one wants anyone to die. It is a matter of Australian priorities.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             What are the real risks of death by a terrorist.  How many people die in a car accident, or crossing the street, or are killed by people they know?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Then how many resources are you ready to put up to deal with those risks?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Our involvement in Iraq is because of two things, first our allegiance to the USA and the poll boost it offers.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Labor has tried to tie itself to the war so it doesn't lose too much on either count. So the 'lefties', if that is what Labor is now a days has joined the chorus.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             From my point of view our resources are best spent making Australia a better place to live.

             Something happens in Canada and paranoia grips this mob, and dear traveller you can crawl under your bed and hide.  Besides that, a far worse incident happened in Victoria over night where 3 members of a family were shot over a minor dispute with a neighbour.  Let's keep things in perspective.

             It was TA who first brought down the security measures around parliament.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Security of parliament is one thing, necessary of course but you do remember there was a guy from Queensland who had no connection to Islam that had plans to bomb the middle of Sydney.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             He was stopped with the current level of security.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             800 police raided numerous houses made one arrest of a minor nature. While at the same time there are over 100,000 cases of family abuse. Over one woman a year is killed by her spouse. Children are being abused throughout the public child care system. Where is our minister for women when these facts are written?
             <br/>

             Abbott has the country running into a corner to suck its thumb over threats from children holding weapons and you are proud of this?

               Are you arguing that we should devote more resources to stopping domestic abuse? If so, how?

                 Trust me Dean, the political/economic is a dead duck. Give it another century and it will seem like a bad dream. It is plainly obvious that the system is unsustainable and corrupt. Why do you support unsustainable corruption?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Oh, and nice misrepresentation and oversimplification of "the left".

                 <br/>
                 Give it a generational cycle and your buddies in government will all be dead. Maybe then some people educated in the ways of the 21st century will steer us from disaster?

                 I think there is a missing word in your first sentence. You seem to be saying that 2 adjectives are dead. Saying "the political/economic is dead' is like saying the classical/botanic is dead."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 So, the political/economic what is dead?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And what is all this corruption?  Probably just normal commerce which so many people have difficulty understanding, and so assume is evil.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And what are these ways of the 21st century that are so special? All the hippy claptrap so beloved by many on the left has been around since the 1930s.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The biggest lesson of the 20th century was that fundamentalist statism is a evil failure. What gurantee do we have that these 21st centeury ways of yours are not just more of the same old statist evil?

                 How does one stop domestic violence? Well maybe by giving that area enough resources to deal with the problem.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 More not fewer safe house for women to go to when in danger. More not fewer case workers to look into domestic violence.
                 <br/>
                 More not fewer outreach programs to help people deal with their anger.
                 <br/>
                 More powers for the police to deal with the problem.

                 yank, if you are so concerned about domestic violence, maybe you might type a few words about ISIS murdering babies, beheading fathers and selling Kurdish girls into sexual slavery, so that they can be repeatedly raped by the "soldiers of peace".

                 I guess you say zero because it hasn't happened in Australia? I imagine those who have been killed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria may beg to differ, if they could speak - whether it be at the hands of Daesh, the Taliban (or the 'allies').

             Well TA telling us that terrorism risks were increasing and raising the terror alert had no practical impact on anything. There is no reason to believe that a clown driving into soldiers or another clown acting apparently alone opening fire could be prevented by public information. There are no charges which have arisen from the police raids which suggest they prevented anything like this occurring. And the new laws would have no impact on the sorts of events which occurred in Canada because they are covered perfectly well under existing laws. There is no reason to believe that laws threatening journalists exposing security agency blunders could have had any impact at all on what happened in Canada.

             So not at all sure how you've exposed any failing of the left in any tangible way. And SHRIEKING IN AN POST ABOUT THE DRUM doesn't really make the right look like a sensible option.

               The term is Moral Panic. Yes there is a threat out there but it is inflated, beyond any reasonable measure. The classic example is shark attack. When ever a shark attack happens there are columns in the newspaper dedicated to the unfortunate victim and people are afraid to go the beach. But the chance of any one person being taken by a shark is almost zero.

               Was a person killed in Canada by a Terrorist in Canada, yes. But lets get some perspective. You are at much more risk driving your car than you are from some terrorist. I was in England when the IRA was blowing up London and there was not the level of panic that I see in Australia.

                 the threat maybe inflated Sydney Bob but of course that is assuming you don't become "the random victim" I'm sure the relatives and close family will take comfort in the fact that more people get killed by motor vehicles.

                 @Reality Bites, what a strange comment.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If you ask the grieving widow of a terrorist victim whether we need tougher terrorism laws then 99.9% of the time they'll say yes. By the same token, if you ask the grieving widow of a cyclist crushed by a truck whether we need better heavy transport practices, 99.9% will agree. Ask the widow of a drug overdoser whether we need law reform and once again they'll agree.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Sydney Bob's call for perspective is important because these matters have always been best addressed by calm and sensible assessment. Agreeing, as you seem to, that the threat is being inflated but suggesting this somehow benefits the families of victims is counterproductive, I can assure you.

                 Dave i said the threat maybe inflated i don't know whether it is or not , the victims would almost certainly say it is not you can't compare the self inflicted drug overdose to the chap who has gone to work one day and become a random victim of some deranged religious nut and then say oh well more people get killed by motor vehicles .

                 Dear reality bites, as a person that has lost 3 family members to a drugged up truckie I can assure you that my pain is exactly the same amount of pain that someone that loses a love one through SIDS, or cancer, or a terrorist attack. A life lost is a life lost, the value of that life doesn't change based on the cause of their death. But the point being made is how much are you willing to sacrifice based on the probability of an event happening?? I have had my life turned upside down by a bad truckie, but I don't expect the police to take all truckies off the road. The current laws work, they just need to be enforced. Equally, if my family had been taken by a terrorist i wouldn't ask the police or ASIO to lock up all muslim men because the current laws work, they just need to be enforced.

                 <br/>
                 The real risk of dying from terrorism is minute. The actual threat is inflated no matter what definition you use. Even in Canada more people have died from smoking in the past few days than terrorism, forget the stats regarding weeks or even months.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If dying is the problem (and it is) then governments are doing the WRONG thing if they exaggerate some causes of death while diminishing others. The Canadian deaths are awful for those involved and certainly unnecessary, but so is every workplace death, every motor vehicle death, many cancer deaths, many obesity deaths etc.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If we're investing literally millions in avoiding possibly no deaths, we're doing it wrong.

             I would be interested to know what your definition of a 'leftie' may be. It's presumably not the ALP as they were supportive of the legislative changes. Perhaps it is libertarians, such as Senator Leyonhjelm, as he was far from convinced. Perhaps it is the Institute of Public Affairs, as Chris Berg was opposed to the legislative changes. Can you enlighten us?

             The problem is that when we raise our level of security we do not have to shout it from the roof tops. This action stinks of political opportunism and almost certainly makes the job of our security forces more difficult than it already is. Do notice that I did not mention Tony Abbott by name as I believe the other mob would have done much the same. This is all a game to the pollies to milk as much political advantage out of a situation as possible.

               Currently they can't wait to rush to the media, spruiking their latest terror alert/activity.  It seems megaphone diplomacy is the order of the day now - a far cry from the secrecy of "on water matters" regarding "unauthorized arrivals".

             Tony Abbott and our internal security forces and police cannot protect you from attacks like this. I'd argue Mr Abbott's Party has taken us in completely the wrong direction. These guys already had their passports seized and were under surveillance, and Canada had similarly raised their level of alert with respect to the potential for a terrorist attack.

             Gd, the current situation in Canada has come about in SPITE of increased security measures.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I don't have any particular confidence in anything "Your (he's certainly not mine) Tony Abbott" might do or say, which will prevent "a similar event".  As I recall, only recently we had a young man shot dead in Melbourne, as a failure to assess the situation.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             "Our Parliament" was forced to make changes after one of the government's own smuggled the makings of a 'pipe bomb' into Parliament with complete ease.  Since then, "Our Parliament" - via Bronwyn Bishop and Stephen Parry - in a moment of complete over-reach - banned the burqa from the gallery.  Following a public outcry, they were forced to remove the ridiculous ban.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             "Our police forces" carried out raids which achieved very little - other than scaring the neighbourhoods in the vicinity and ensuring it was all captured on camera.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The terror alert was raised as a final act by the retiring ASIO Chief - a gift to Tony Abbott, who had been faring badly as a result of his broken promises and unfair Budget.  It proved to be a very convenient distraction for him.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             None of these measures has caused me to be "glad"...

           Yesterday I read about a political party accused of appropriating a still-warm dead body to use for their own unsavoury purposes.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I have a sneaking suspicion I've just read an individual pulling the same stunt today.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In his rush to start pushing his barrow John Blaxland seems to have missed a bit, so I'll add it for him;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Our deepest condolences go out to all impacted by this tragedy".

             It's not just Blaxland mindlessly misappropriating this tragedy, just a short while ago ABC News 24 broadcast a report on the breathless local reaction that was accompanied by dramatic, moody, tense music. No, seriously. Our ABC, the public broadcaster charged with the responsibility of delivering sedate, sober and unbiased news is making movies. Manipulating viewers' emotions. Turning the news into an entertainment.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As an Australian citizen, I apologise to everyone touched by the Canadian tragedy for the Australian national broadcaster's appalling lapse. It was a distasteful transgression and journalistically immature which unfortunately is also indicative of this culture's steady decline.

               As a former journalist I'd hate to see the ABC bite the dust because without it the media would be out of balance, but I sometimes wonder what gets coverage and what not. The neverending Pistorious reports went very much up my nose, because THAT relevant he and his case were not. And he is not even Australian and has absolutely no connection to Australia. I have been shocked in recent days to read how things happen in the German media and if our media follow that same influence (described by former participant Dr. Udo Ulfkotte), ... well, it would be at least an explanation.

                 Hey blax, the level of journalism in this country hit an all time low the other morning when the headline story was about some unfortunate chap in Kings Cross had his nose broken in a fight with a group of men, the twist being that one of his assailants MAY have been a Rugby League player. This rubbish eclipsed all other news that morning.

           Personally, I think the premise of this article is wrong.  I think Canadians are every bit as aware of the dangers of the modern world as Australians are.  We've had our own terrorist plots, including several Islamist ones recently;  we saw the provincial legislature in Quebec shot up some years ago (not by a terrorist, but people died all the same);  we had Sikh extremists blowing up Air India; and of course back in the 60s and 70s we had the FLQ tossing bombs and murdering a politician.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The difference is that, in the latter instance, the Canadian government of the day dealt with the October Crisis of 1970 by imposing swingeing restrictions on normal Canadian rights under the War Measures Act.  The measures were temporary, but their impact on the Canadian psyche still resonates after over 40 years.  For a short period, we lost rights we took for granted.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As a result,  Canadians seem to be far more aware than Australians of the danger of placing security concerns above the fundamental rights of an open democracy.  Very few Canadians who can remember those days want to see the War Measures Act, or anything resembling it, ever imposed again.  Canadians are far more wary of security agencies and of the RCMP than Australians are of their counterparts, and far less inclined to trust authority without asking some hard questions.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           From reading the comments on the Canadian websites, for every Canadian demanding tougher measures against terrorists, there are two or three warning about the loss of those freedoms.  The current PM may possibly have the votes to impose new and more intensive security measures after this, but he will not do it without having a major firefight on his hands.

             Another thoughtful contribution thanks Frang.  But after having real bullets flying around in the vicinity of the parliament I imagine a metaphorical firefight would be the preferred option.  Is this the second apparent terrorist victim this week in Canada or the third?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sad for the victim.  Presume a reservist guarding a war memorial would not be issued bullets.

             Very good response, Frangipani. I tend to agree with most of the other articles Mr Blaxland has written, but I think this one is nonsense. I am not Canadian, and have no particular insights into the country, but it would have been my understanding Canada has much, much greater first hand experience of terrorism than we have. I also can't see any great difference between the response here and in Canada. Both countries had already raised their security levels, and clearly the security response in Ottawa was very strong. There was no shortage of heavily armed men there very rapidly. Both these guys had already had their passports seized and were under surveillance. And the reason Canadians once wore the Canadian flag on their bags was to differentiate them from Americans because of the similar accent - which is quite a different thing to imagining nobody wants to hurt you. It is just a recognition yanks are a preferred target. The Canadians also have more of an American-influenced libertarian attitude to security and government - most market on the Conservative side of politics. Australia by comparison has more a British "big brother" attitude to security issues.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As a few above have said, if these two attacks demonstrate anything it is that you can't stop these kinds of attacks with any level of security. As far as I am aware, this attack occurred on an armed, well trained soldier, and that just demonstrates how difficult something like this is to stop. Although these kinds of attacks are also normally fairly easily brought to an end - these guys are typically not well trained or particularly capable. This has been demonstrated repeatedly. More of these kinds of attacks will occur. Eventually, we will have one here, and I don't think the security measures we are putting in place here will significantly alter this fact.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Personally, should attacks like this continue - and I think they will - I think they may require a completely reappraising our approach to security. I don't think the big brother approach is going to work. You need to empower those who are going to be the "Johnny on the spot" when these attacks occur. Much of the chatter coming out of Canada is already along those lines.

               hnw, the soldier who was murdered was armed with an empty rifle and was standing a ceremonial guard, in other words he stood no chance. It may have been different had the soldier been fully armed with live ammunition and had the freedom to manouvre but under those circumstances it is highly doubtful this cretin would have chosen to target him.

                 Im far more concerned that with the ABC accept the burqa stance that the majority of the stories they placed on the Drum and majority they showed on the news did not call or display an actual burqa.  It was far more common to have the title with the word burqa associated with a picture of a hajib.  Even niqabs where far more present than the burqa.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 If the ABC cant maintain a consistent definition of a word it is campaigning should be accepted, it is hard to believe their view is well informed.  Much less when it was suddenly suitable to prevent a t-shirt which mentioned no races or cultures.  I can only predict the ABC fit if anyone started to boycott companies that made or sold burqa related attire.

           Don't worry I'm sure his recent conversion to Islam had nothing to do with the shooting. In face he wasn't really a muslim because Islam is a religion of peace. I mean who is he to decide what religion he follows anyway? Just as ISIS have no right to decide that they are followers of Islam. Everyone knows that western leaders and journalists get to decide if you are indeed muslim or not, then they can either pop you in the 'peaceful religion' box and hold you on display, or disregard you as a violent extremest with no Islamic correlation.
           <br/>
           One thing is for sure, if Mohammed was alive today - I don't think he'd be put in the peaceful box and praised as a peace loving man.

               What about Western Budhists, Sikhs, Tamals, Hindus etc.  However the largest group that are killed every year are Christians, simply because the rst of the world hates them because they have the free gift of slavation bestowed upon them.  People from EVERY other religion have to earn it.

             They also get to decide not to ever have a Muslim that believes in what they deem anti Islamic views such as banning the burqa or attacking the Islamic council for suggesting a separate legal system.

             Fortunately Muslims in Australia are far more reasonable and diverse than the ABC will ever try to demonstrate.

           Interesting article.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In my opinion we are over the top in our  "knee-jerk reaction of anger, fear and hatred".
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When a 17 year old kid strikes fear in the leaders of the country we have a problem. It is as if we are now so afraid we now can't look into the darker corners of our fear's.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Australians have become like children hearing about the big bad wolf. we are now letting that fear overwhelm our desire to live in a free country. The baddies have in a sense won. What Australia stood for has been thrown away by pics of kids with guns.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Our forefathers would have wondered what they fought and died for. Is this country ever going to find a backbone?

             Talk about ridiculous hyperbole! There is no evidence that any 17 year old has struck fear into our country's leaders. Some said they were shocked and disgusted but that's not the same thing.

             A 17yr old is just as dangerous as a 27yr old. This persons age has no impact on his threat or lack thereof. It is immaterial. You are sounding a wee bit like he's 7. The issue is people leaving Australia to fight over there and here is proof that another one has slipped out. That makes the tally bugger all. That makes another one dedicated to overthrowing middle eastern regimes. That doesn't necessarily follow that he or the others are planning to come back and if they do, to kill Australians. But whilst it doesn't hurt to be careful we should be ever cautious that we're not all getting a bit hysterical.

                 It dosnt take anything special to use a car to kill soldiers, it takes minimal effort to get a gun and it is very easy to learn how to make a bomb especially if you are surrounded by fanatics that wish to help you.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The age of the maker of a bomb does not impact the damage of the explosion.  What impacts the explosion can quite easily be found or created with basic university chemistry knowledge or a cheat sheet from the jihad media.

                 The fear of course is that the extremists are like cockroaches for every one you see there are a hundred others.

                 I don't know if that is the case or not is this an iceberg with nine tenths hidden or exactly what it looks like a few religious zealots following what they believe to be their mandated calling.

                 <br/>
                 I can hold both ideas in my head but cannot resolve them and there is evidence both ways depending on who you read or watch.

                 The sad truth is that it did happen the threat in Canada was identified and an Australian child has chosen his version of religion over his nation and those ethics.

             Actually, Yank, I find 'pics of kids with guns' quite disturbing. Particularly, Australian 'kids' who are backed and inspired by a murderous global network.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             We need extraordinary measures to counter the insidious forces that are brainwashing these Australian 'kids' on our soil.

             <br/>
             I know, the probability of you or I becoming an ISIL victim is miniscule, but do you want this influence spreading in your community?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Remember. About two-thirds of people who returned from Afghanistan went on to be involved in ?home-grown terrorist plotting.

             What's really interesting is how leftie self-loathers are going to work out the current situation. For the past weeks they've been self-flagellating - how we've cause these people to be terrorists. But alas, Canada doesn't fit into that model. Canada is in fact way more progressive than Australia and far less involved in the Middle East.

           Maybe it is simply our distance from our US allies that explains the difference. The US would have a greater desire to come to Canada's defence (no criticism of the US intended in stating this) simpyl because they are next door. After all a major problem in Canada could spill over into the US.

           I can only presume ASIO had picked up some intel which suggested a similar attack may occur on our parliament and the government acted on that. I suspect the opposition has been breifed on that hence the lockstep on this. fair enough too - kudos for the opposition not making an issue out of the situation.

           It goes with out saying countries lining up against the IS in Syria is causing a ramp in domestic terrorism but could it be these loonies would act anyway over time.

               Look I didn't say Australia or anyone else for that matter should be involved. I personally don't see the point if these people want to kill each other it's nothing to do with me but that all changes if they start their nonsense here.

           Not good that's for sure.  Not sure why he's called a terrorist - could be because he's of middle eastern origin.
           <br/>
           The cops that shot a guy 5 times in Brisbane because he drove his car at them haven't been called terrorists, nor was the angry guy who was driving the car
           <br/>
           Hmmm there's definitely a pattern here with the media........anyone is muslim religion or middle eastern origin is called a terrorist if he commits a crime or is alleged to have committed a crime.
           <br/>
           So there's a real good job being done to keep bigotry and fear alive

             Canada has had two soldiers killed in three days in Canada by people who had each had their passports pulled by the Canadian government because they were believed to be jihadists.  I doubt that either was part of any organized extremist group, but it's not unreasonable to believe they share the general aims of those extremists.

               I take issue with the fact that  perpertrators of crime, or alleged crime, who follow Islam are categorized as extremists and therefore terrorists.
               <br/>
               What about the christian guys who have gone postal and killed a bunch of kids and adults over the USA and here in Australia....they have not been referred to as extremists nor terrorists.  And they most certainly are/were extremists and terrorists.  So the attitude of law enforcement and media is prejudicial and is looking a whole lot like persecution of people who follow Islam.

                 LfP, possibly the answer lies in the motives.  Islamic terrorists always claim that their acts are in the name of Islam.  I suspect the Christians you are talking about have not committed atrocities in the name of Christianity, just that they are general nutters with other random grudges (putting aside the Irish issue).  Eg the young kid who was killed in the US not long ago after wanting to shoot women because they didn't like him.  It doesn't look like persecution at all really.

                 You raise a good point.  However if a guy is made very angry because he's had his passport taken  and his life disrupted and if he has a volatile personality his reaction could be extreme.  But so could the guy with the volatile personality who goes nuts in a drunken rage and kills someone.

                 And I take issue with the notion that the government just randomly denies passports to persons of Islamic persuasion.  There are well over a million Muslims living in Canada - a handful have had their passports pulled.  This man, and the fellow that ran down two soldiers two days ago, happened to be among them.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 I don't suppose either of them belonged to ISIS - but I do suppose both had intentions of travelling to the region to join them.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And as I recall quite a few Christian extremists tagged with the term "terrorist" in the US - McVee and Eric Rudolph.  Rightly so.  Someone who kills women and children is a murderer;  someone who kills  women and children, or unarmed soldiers, as a means of attacking the institutions of the state, is a terrorist.  I don't actually care whether he's a Christian attacking abortion clinics, a Sikh putting bombs on Air India planes, or a Muslim blowing up nightclubs in Bali or shooting up the Canadian parliament.

                 @whohasthefish:  That is not my intention.  My intention is to say that terrorism exists and we need to be aware of it.  And when we see it, we need to act on it, not pretend it isn't there.  But the mechanisms in place in Canada and Australia right now are adequate to deal with these kind of isolated incidents.  We don't need to demonize Muslims or give up valued civil rights to add one more layer of protection.

                 Terrorist incidents increased a hundred fold after two events: the casting out of the Muslim brotherhood by Nasser, and the huge windfall to OPEC after they formed the cartel (including our so-called mates in Saudi Arabia).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 With the brotherhood now deposed by a coup, without a word of objection from us democracy-lovers no less, I worry to think what the outcomes of them being evicted from civil governance will lead to.

                 Incidentally, our involvement in Afghanistan in now our longest engagement in Australian history? I still don't even know how we ended up there. Does anyone?

             Agree with the sentiment here.  Categorising and reporting these incidents in a discriminatory fashion unduly raises alarm over organised activity.

             Apart from the title the article doesn't explicity refer to this event as terrorism, but relating it back to safety concerns or any likeness to Australia seems alarmist.

           My sympathy to all those directly and indirectly affected by the events in Canada.  Gone are the days when rebellious teenagers smoked cigarettes behind the school toilets and took a swig of the old man's liquor behind his back.  Now it seems they get hold of a firearm and fire it at people going about their daily lives. Perhaps after gaining a bit of Dutch courage from illicit drugs but not always.
           <br/>
           The argument about whether these events are directly related to any political decisions made by our government is a useless debate by those who wish to reinforce their own political beliefs.  For every action there is likely to be a reaction but the misguided among us will be attracted by what can be seen as the most recent effective way to intimidate.

           When is the terror alarm going to be raised in our nations nightclub precincts and taxi ranks where innocent people are being terrorised by drunks/druggies.   If we're going to address terrorists lets not be hypocritical and select one group from the community.....we have to address the behaviour which terrorizes.    Or do we really excuse our drunken assaulters because someone is making a profit from the booze they purchase

           A shot is fired in a country on the other side of the world where it is going into winter while we go into summer, and get this John, like a shot our Government and the media reject New Zealand as our closest and most dearest neighbour. Talk about propaganda. Are there sheep in Canada John? There is a lot of Maple syrup in Canada. Australia and New Zealand share the Union Jack on both flags.

             Not sure what your point is.  Australia and Canada have a lot in common in terms of language, democratic heritage, and legal systems.  That Canada doesn't have a Union Jack on its national flag any more is perhaps less important than that, like Australia, it does have a Sergeant at Arms in its Parliament.  Today, that particular bit of heritage mattered more than a flag.

           I have a suggestion which I feel would, if not stop any home grown terrorism in its tracks, greatly diminish its likelihood.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It is extremely simple and would have positive effects on both inter-religious tensions and the budget.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We immediately withdraw all our military forces from the Middle East and send John Howard and a few members of the cabinet of 2003 to the Hague to be prosecuted for war crimes.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It's so simple I wonder why nobody else has thought of it.

           The danger of governments that take a conflict based approach to problem solving is that they alienate the segments of society that support moderation and stir up individuals who are for some reason disaffected with their world.  This creates a situation where standard security and intelligence process are less effective.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The current strategy in the middle east, far from leading to improvements seems to be leading to greater alienation, greater activity by the emotionally unstable and, from the military reports, with very limited if any impacts on ISIL.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There is a need to deal with the deplorable tactics of ISIL, but the current strategy is short sighted and ill conceived.

           The tin foil hat brigade has quietened down given the apparent genuine nature of this terrorist threat from ISIS.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           No-one is claiming this attack in Canada was 'theatre' by the Australian government.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The preventative measures taken by our security forces are justified and necessary.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Is it correct to charactierize someone as a 'lone wolf' if they are motivated by an ancient and global philosophy in concert with a war of conquest in the middle east?    I wouldn't have thought so.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But then, we are supposed to be politically correct and continue to maintain that all of this is nothing to do with religion.     Of course not.     Lone wolf martrydom.   Tikber.

           A person with possibly a mental health issue walks into parliament and shoots someone(which is very sad) we have to call them a terrorist, to make our government look strong. If hes a terrorist how about Simon Bryant,Julian Knight even chopper reid. Its beaten up in relation to terrorism to justify our presence protecting the iraqi oil fields.

           The world may jump up and down on this occasion.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           However, this is not a new thing and terrorists have practiced and refined their acts many years ago. The victim on that occasion was India and very serious attack by multi-person group was made.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Has the world done enough to address that attack? Unless all cases of terrorist acts are treated with same degree of sincerity we shall not be eliminating these horrors.

           Let's be clear that Australia's terror threat is entirely 'optional'.  It is a function of our immigration policy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Articles like this try to make it seem like the threat flows only from our decisions regarding joining wars...  But joining wars creates only 'motive'.  What creates 'opportunity' is immigration policies.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Everything should be able to be discussed.

           This sentence is pure fiction when it invades, kills, occupies  and disperses millions of innocent citizens from the illegal and immoral false flag wars of the American Neo-Cons who have infiltrated the White House for the benefit of the military industrial complex trans-corporations and to try and fulfil the  American hegemony.  Craving up the Middle East  for the benefit of Zionist Israel has not made anyone safer it has created chaos and massive catastrophe! The highest percentage in these invasions is the civilians.  Where is the respect of their civil liberties and freedoms for them?  Respect must come for other countries not just your own myopic view.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There has been huge multiple  military blunders in both invasions and huge corruption for the racket of war.  What do these countries expect when you falsely invade, kill and occupy their respective countries who were no threat to the US or Australia.  The opium  has developed 4 times the amount since the invasion by the Americans.  It is always about god.  Gas Oil Drugs. We follow down this insane road of draconian laws and legislation every time there is an 'incident' compared to the thousands of $billions spent on war.  We have been thrust into this insane war that was a complete fabrication as was Vietnam.   We have heighten levels of threats that we never had before.  We have division among ourselves with the Muslims in this country. Australia does not have the courageous men and women to defy the US in their false flag wars.  As an ally we can say no but we are merely 'yes men' to the Neo-Cons which proves over and over again we are a docile and submissive 'client state'.

             Apparently this guy wanted to leave Canada to join the IS and was stopped. Not a very clever thing to do, he became frustrated and held his own Jihad. Let them go and don't let the back problem solved.

           I don't know if what happened in Canada was a terrorist attack, but I think it suits the political agenda to name it as such.  It's likely that anyone in the future who carries out a violent crime will be named as a terrorist.  The first reporting of the Bali bombings said it was as a result of a "feud" between rival business owners, however I think they changed it to a terrorist act to get more assistance .

           There was a triple murder in our own backyard in Logan Vic just the day before.  In my understanding murder is murder, but this local story will disappear from all but the memories of locals while we continue to give air to our issues with the external enemy within..
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The truth is in Australia one is more likely to be murdered by a disgruntled neighbour than by a mixed up sociopath running from demons and claiming Jihad.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The ISIS phenomenon is sadly giving disenfranchised and depressed people another outlet for their murderous rage, the basest of human instincts.
           <br/>
           We also note that most of the ISIS fighters killed by US strikes were foreign nationals, many from wealthy nations.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Maybe we could take a step back from this and reflect on the causes.

           A lot of comments here, but until you read the Quran for yourself you don?t know the real issues involved.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There are over 100 verses in the Quran that encourage violence against non-Muslims.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The Quran opens with a warning that its contents cannot be doubted.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Don?t take my word for it, read it yourselves.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Islamic fascism will probably win this war because they take the text to heart and are willing to train hard and ruthlessly kill.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The average Australian, American and European cannot even be bothered to make a minimal effort and at least read Islam?s most sacred book in order to understand why.

           If we have now reached the stage where our servicemen and women are advised to consider NOT wearing uniforms in Australia then the Muslim extremists have won and we have surrendered to them in spectacular fashion, that is the ultimate capitulation. If we surround our parliament with automatic weapons on perceived threats they have won. At some stage we have to declare as Churchill did for England in WWII " we will never surrender!" and refuse to let the hype and baseless fears destroy our way of life. End of rant. Vale Australia!

           This fight has been brewing for 2000 years ever since the Romans pushed the Jews out Judea, then the Franc's pushed the Muslims out, the Muslims pushed back and eventually the West provided the means for the Jews to return. Islam has been itching for an all out conflict for 70 years. Maybe it's time to give it to them. If the western world seriously committed like they did in Europe in 1944 this could be over within a year.

           Now that the hand of friendship has been bitten do we simply turn the other cheek?  Our open democratic society is being openly abused but we can't discuss it unless we offend someone.

           I believe what is necessary is to show photos of these terrorists after they have been blown up or shot, showing all the blood and guts, they insides hanging out, arms shot off, brains and blood all over the sidewalk as a clear illustration to others who think it all comes to a glorious ending.

           I find it childish when people mention the Left or Right. As Yank did at the top of this page.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Aside from Yank, we are all Australians.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As a sceptic I do not believe the arguments of either without proof. These days Right usually means Christian fundamentalists. Left means latte sippers. Whatever that means???
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As far as I can tell, education is key. That there is any kind of religious war taking place in 2014 is shocking. As Pinker said, "science flies you to the moon. Religion flies you into buildings.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We need to educate our children in modern ethics and science. Get chaplains out of public schools and try to move adults away from believing in fables and demons and magic.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Perhaps then we can face our problems rationally.

           Terrorism? I guess.  The apparent motive had at least something to do with Islamic political hate, as may also have been the case with the previous hit-and-run incident - which didn't seem to raise the threat level, at least not to the Canadians - but we'll never know, both perpetrators are dead, and nobody credible, so far, is taking responsibility, a hallmark of every other actual terrorist incident you can name.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Perhaps you're all too young to remember the days when there seemed to be an airliner highjacking regularly, but most of those weren't terrorism, just criminals and crazy people, even when they claimed to espouse some cause.  It took a long time to get airport security to the point where it was prior to 2001, and now look where we are, all from one set of incidents, some underwear and an attempt to blow up a pair of sneakers.  Now that there are shootings in Ottawa, are we intending to turn our Parliament into an armed fortress? Abandon the liberties our society fought to create and protect from every previous threat, foreign and domestic?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We give more power to the actual terrorists by doing so.  And we encourage the crazies.  Instead of stooping to their level - and reacting to insanity as if it was something more than it is, and turning our society into a model of what the real enemy both accuses us of being and embodies, that's what we're doing - let's stand up to them by strengthening our resolve to be, as the US Constitution puts it, "more perfect" in our unity.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We don't have to be cowards or bullies or afraid of those who are.  We can always do better, so let's.

           Many fallacies in this article regarding Canadian war history.
           <br/>
           "But for a long time, Canadians have felt safer than Australians."
           <br/>
           "Canadians have tended to maintain their defence force as a defence against help from an overbearing neighbouring 'uncle' Sam."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Both of these statements bear no truth. Our military history is as long as Australia's and bloodier. 640,00 fought in WW1, half again as many as Australia.
           <br/>
           We entered WW2 in 1939, a full three years before Australia.
           <br/>
           We did not participate in Iraq, where your countries brave military(not being sarcastic) suffered 2 KIAs. But we did fight in Afghanistan where we suffered 158 KIAs as compared to Australia's 41.
           <br/>
           Don't think for one minute that we are sheep cowering in the shadow of the US.
           <br/>
           We do not have a large population and therefore, we do not have a large military.
           <br/>
           But we do have teeth...

           My wife and I are living in Canada at the moment and we were thinking the other day of how things could have changed so dramatically.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           If you changed a few variables we could have lost significant numbers of both sides of the federal parliament (a case not encountered in all of human history - I think).
           <br/>
           <br/>
           So then we would go to election. The country would be in a state of fear and in all likeliness the most right winged individual you could muster would get elected in.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           From that point on Canada would be a very different place.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Gives you a sense of how things can change so quickly in a place you would normally think as being secure.

             Dave, yes fear is a powerful thing. Barry Cassidy writes today about the fear politics and media that has infested the Australian parliament and society for many years and its negative effects on us all.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Michael Moore (like him or not) in his documentary 'Bowling for Columbine' delved into the difference between Canadian society to that of the US. He explored the fact that in Windsor, Canada, pop 216,000 they had one gun related murder in a particular year whilst 1 mile away across the river in Detroit, USA, pop 660,000 there were 353 gun related murders in the same corresponding period. On further investigation he concluded the difference between the two cities, and for that matter the two countries was the never ending 'fear' politics and media in the USA compared the relevant absence of such politics and media in Canada.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Fear is a powerful thing and it can infect societies and governments alike. Hopefully Canada does not go down the same path as the Yanks in reference to these events. It takes more courage to stand up to fear than to succumb to it.

           Well put John.  A lot better job than that put by Barry Cassidy.  My only question would be that when you say 'Australia, in contrast.......' is whether you mean Australia as in public or Australia as in Government.  The public generally does not understand risk and its management.

           The Canadian and Australian governments seem affronted that anyone could commit violence against them in their own countries. This is the blind arrogance that comes with using military force on the assumption the people being attacked have no way of fighting back. I heard Julie Bishop saying how terrible the Canadian incident was and "how would we like it happening here?". I wonder if she's ever tried applying the same kind of empathy to the millions of people for whom bombs falling from the sky are a regular occurrence, courtesy of the USA and countries like ours. How would she like that happening here? And how can she pretend there will never be blowback? Of course the people we have been invading, killing and maiming will try to fight back in any way they can, just as we would if the situation were reversed.
