         Let me state at the outset that this lecture
         <em>
          is
         </em>
         about
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         , though at times it will be so only north by northwest  because this lecture will be speaking of
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         in the context of a death in the family, and that familys attempts to make meaning of life in the face of that death.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its the same struggle Gilgamesh experiences in the worlds oldest religious story.

         Death, Consolation, and the Problem of Evil
        </h2>
        <p>
         My wife lost her mother two weeks ago. Her mother was a good woman, and passionately Christian. Yet her life was ended at a young 64 by a stroke followed closely by a terminal cancer. My wife, on the one hand, cannot understand how the god her mother loved so much would end her life so early; and on the other hand, my wife now feels pulled to explore her mothers religion in order to understand and, she hopes, experience the happiness this religion gave her mother.
        </p>
        <p>
         The question my wife keeps asking is Why? Its an old and bedeviling question in Christianity, one that theologians have a term for:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil">
          theodicy
         </a>
         , the problem of evil, in a universe purportedly controlled by a god said to be both all-powerful and all-good. If he
         <em>
          is
         </em>
         these things, then how could he stand by and watch this devout woman die such a slow and tragically early death?
        </p>
        <p>
         Had this death occurred before I began this series on
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         , I probably would have offered insights about our reaction to death and loss from Buddhism and Taoism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Im not a Buddhist because I find reincarnation as improbable  and as devoid of compelling evidence  as I find notions of heaven and hell (though Buddhisms lack of a permanent hell makes it a more humane metaphysics than Christianity or Islam, in my view). But the Buddhas teachings on how we create our own suffering by letting our fear and desire master us strike me simply as psychological, not religious, wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fearing death is unwise like fearing old age is: its part of the natural order  and theres the Tao  so fearing it is unprofitable. Add to that that death is an unknown, and as far as evidence goes, most probably is nothing more than oblivion on the order of an eternal and peaceful sleep without dreams, and there seems little cause for fear. Sadness, yes, but not fear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Desiring immortality or, more to the point, to see our deceased loved ones again in an afterlife, is equally painful. In our most honest, quiet, interior moments, I cant help but suspect that we all harbor extreme doubts that theres an eternal reunion of friends and family in any heaven. But our desire that this be the case, despite our secret honesty, sets the stage for inner conflict, for anguish, as hope battles skepticism and desire battles realism in our breasts. Resolution favors doubt on this question, and thus, so long as we side with our desired fantasy over the evidence of our senses, we dont find peace.
        </p>
        <p>
         It really boils down to a conflict between
         <strong>
          naturalism
         </strong>
          what we guess or reason by observing nature  and
         <strong>
          supernaturalism
         </strong>
         : the teachings about unobservable things from ancient tribal books and their interpreters in todays various priestly classes.
        </p>
        <p>
         But to repeat: I would have offered the above perspectives
         <em>
          had this death occurred before my studies of
         </em>
         Gilgamesh. Thats not the case. And I am as surprised as the next person that I find myself now believing that
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         offers a wisdom about death and how it is best dealt with that is superior to that of Buddhism.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I mentioned in my
         <a href="http://beyond-school.org/2008/09/19/another-foreigner-story-the-westerner-at-the-korean-funeral/">
          last post
         </a>
         , the three days mourning and funeral for my Korean mother-in-law here in Seoul was dominated by one book: the Bible. There was one other book present during those rites, and it was my copy of
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         . As the Korean mourners and I sat on the floor with the Christian preacher leading her flock in readings, songs, and prayers  none of which I could understand, of course  I found it entirely appropriate to read this other ancient meditation on mortality and the meaning of life, since it was, after all, from a religion and a book that lived in peoples hearts for four thousand years at least  twice as long as Christianity has lived so far  and which informed and influenced the
         <em>
          Bible
         </em>
         as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I was told that it looked disrespectful to be reading this book as the Koreans looked to their own ancient book for guidance, I put the book away. When in Rome and all of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I got the chance, later, to explain to my wife why that book was
         <em>
          profoundly
         </em>
         relevant to the occasion. Call it a rehearsal for this post. Here goes.

         concluded with Shamhat  the temple prostitute who played a holy Eve by sexually elevating the animal Adam Enkidu into civilization  leading Enkidu to the city to experience its glories and to meet Gilgamesh, its king. We noted the contradiction of Enkidus feelings about meeting the king. On the one hand, he looked forward to Gilgamesh satisfying his new yearning for a true friend; but on the other hand, he declared he would challenge Gilgamesh to a fight for two reasons: first, to stop the kings unjust practice of taking each new brides virginity before her husband on her wedding day; and second, simply to show he was physically mightier than the king.
        </p>
        <p>
         I find the story from this point to the end of the fight scene only marginally interesting. Gilgamesh has a few dreams portending Enkidus arrival that disturb him, and we see the unsurprising evidence that this ancient culture, like so many others, saw dreams as possible messages from the divine. Beyond that, we see hints that male friendship in this culture might be homosexual  which wont surprise anybody familiar with similar hints about Achilles and Patroclus in the
         <em>
          Iliad
         </em>
         , practically

         Then comes the big fight scene: Gilgamesh shows up to taste his latest bride, but Enkidu blocks his way. Their fight is predictably over-the-top, half saloon-brawl in a cliche cowboy movie, half the Incredible Hulk, and finally Gilgamesh pins Enkidu. Enkidus a good sport: he acknowledges that Gilgamesh is his superior, that he has the right to rule, and declares his loyalty. They kiss, hold hands, and walk back to the palace.

         Another WTF Plot Twist: The Quest to Kill Natures Evil Guardian
        </h2>
        <p>
         Im intimidated at this point, because the plot turn that happens here, just a third of the way into the story, connects to everything that happens from this point forward. Its a huge and intricate tapestry of meaning from this point on, and I honestly dont know if Im equal to the task of holding all the threads together. Ill do my best, though.
        </p>
        <p>
         The plot turn I speak of is this: After an unspecified period of time during which Gilgamesh and Enkidu cement their friendship in the city, Gilgamesh gets a wild hair up his behind and announces to Enkidu that he has a new mission: He and Enkidu are going to travel to the Cedar Forest, a sacred place which men are forbidden to enter, in order to kill its evil guardian, the monster Humbaba, and chop down the tallest cedar tree in the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Enkidu, remember, was originally a semi-animal in the wild, running with the gazelles and fighting off the lions that preyed upon them. He knew the Cedar Forest, knew it was sacred to the god of the wind, Enlil, and knew that Humbaba, being appointed by Enlil to protect the forest, was thus not a creature so easy to label as evil. So Enkidu begs the hot-blooded young king to drop this idea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gilgamesh and Enkidu argue about this, and the interesting thing about the argument is this: Enkidu frames his argument in terms of the sacred. The forest is holy, Humbaba is its divinely-appointed guardian, and so to kill Humbaba would be a sacrilege. Gilgamesh, though, frames the argument not in terms of the sacred, but in terms of
         <em>
          the heroic
         </em>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me assure you that, as an English teacher, Ive always inwardly groaned at how often other English teachers trot out the unit on the Heros Journey. Its not a bad thing, this theory. Anybody whos read books like Joseph Campbells
         <em>
          The Hero with a Thousand Faces
         </em>
         knows how fascinating the subject is. What makes me groan is its popularity. Its the Hotel California or Stairway to Heaven (or, god help us, the Free Bird) of English units, trotted out so many times that even the wormiest of us booky types must get tired of it after the thousandth listening. The other thing that makes me groan is that, in the wrong hands, it becomes as formulaic as the dreaded, crappy five-paragraph essay. Theres something dangerous about prescribing to students that they take every story under the sun and shoehorn it into the Heros Journey formula. By reducing stories to that framework, we can ignore whats unique or surprising that
         <em>
          doesnt
         </em>
         fit so nicely into that shoe.
        </p>
        <p>
         So trust me, I offer the following as one of the few times I
         <em>
          want
         </em>
         to talk about a story in these terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whats interesting about
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         to me, more than anything, is really the mind of the poets who polished and revised this story from its early Sumerian version around the 23rd century BCE to its later Babylonian version in the 12th century BCE. Unlike other ancient books that were edited and revised by countless hands over many centuries  the Bible comes to mind more than any other book I know 
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         seems to have
         <em>
          gained
         </em>
         in coherence and consistency of vision over time, rather than becoming, like the Bible, more contradictory and less coherent.
        </p>
        <p>
         And the vision all these
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         poets so sharply refined is one that, contrary to appearances, is deeply
         <em>
          anti-heroic
         </em>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         You dont realize it in the current scene. Gilgamesh answers Enkidus religious argument with an argument based on heroism. His motives boil down to these two: first, he wants to achieve something no other mortal has achieved, and so  since none of us can escape death, he says  gain immortality for his name,
         <em>
          in stories
         </em>
         of his exploits; and second, he wants to rid the world of evil. He doesnt respond to Enkidus arguments at all. Instead, he chides Enkidu for being cowardly, and finally wins Enkidu over by this shaming tactic.
        </p>
        <p>
         So the Hero argument wins the day. Well see, by the end, that it was a fools argument as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before closing this installment, a couple more observations:
        </p>
        <h2>
         The Double That Balances Motif, and Another Genesis, Backwards Trope
        </h2>
        <p>
         To step back from the canvas for a second to take a larger view, we should review the original wtf plot twist so far: the god Anus solution to Gilgameshs oppressive behavior as king by creating Enkidu as a double that balances him, and so brings peace to Uruk. In the first stage of this pattern, we saw Gilgamesh as symbol of the city, and Enkidu as symbol of nature; Gilgamesh as civilization, Enkidu as animal; Gilgamesh as two-thirds divine, one-third human, Enkidu as two-thirds animal, one-third human.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, though, weve seen Enkidu seem to
         <em>
          upset
         </em>
         that balance by crossing over to Gilgameshs side. Sex with Shamhat erased his original animal innocence and replaced it with full humanity; his journey to the city took him out of the realm of nature; and though he resists Gilgameshs urge to kill Humbaba and violate the Cedar Forest, his ultimate submission again places him now on the same side as Gilgamesh, rather than opposing him as a balancing double.
        </p>
        <p>
         But look what is about to happen: Gilgamesh is about to lead Enkidu
         <em>
          out
         </em>
         of the city 
         <em>
          out of his own territory
         </em>
          and
         <em>
          into
         </em>
         Nature, the original domain of Enkidu. So in a sense, we see Enkidu cross into civilization only to  wtf  see Gilgamesh now balance this by
         <em>
          entering Enkidus territory
         </em>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Note, further, that something is
         <em>
          imbalanced
         </em>
         about all of this nonetheless: because while Enkidu, when in his original state of animal innocence,
         <em>
          protected
         </em>
         the other animals
         <em>
          from
         </em>
         predators and, more significantly,
         <em>
          human
         </em>
         trappers, Gilgamesh is entering nature with the
         <em>
          opposite
         </em>
         intention: to conquer it, to
         <em>
          kill
         </em>
         its guardian, and to
         <em>
          exploit its natural resources
         </em>
         - the tallest cedar  for the benefit of civilization.
        </p>
        <p>
         That was wordy, I know. Im getting tired. But I hope you can see how very, very deep this is.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said in the very first lecture, this is the story of possibly the first walled city in human history. That means its the story of the first civilization to wall itself off from nature, and
         <em>
          radically
         </em>
         exploit nature in order to develop its civilization. Since pre-civilized humans worshiped nature for hundreds of thousands of years in the paleolithic and neolithic ages, it seems quite reasonable to suspect that the people of the first city, cutting down forests for buildings and mining the earth for gold, silver, and the lapis lazuli so loved by the Sumerians,
         <em>
          must have felt a certain fear as they violated Nature for the good of their city life.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thats whats so radical, to me, about the coming episode in the Cedar Forest. Its holy to the gods. Man should not violate it. Humbaba is only evil from the viewpoint of the city people who want lumber for more housing, temples, markets. From the viewpoint of most of human pre-history, Humbaba is closer to an angel of the lords.
        </p>
        <p>
         And Gilgamesh wants to kill him.
        </p>
        <p>
         To pre-empt the type of comment that I frequently get accusing me of one-sidedness, let me make this clear: Civilization
         <em>
          is
         </em>
         glorious in this poem, according to its poets. They sing its praises with unambiguous adoration. And they surely understood that civilization thus
         <em>
          required
         </em>
         the lumber, the minerals, the precious stones, and all the other natural resources sacred to the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
         And thats one of the beauties of this classic: we see the earths first advanced civilizations rightly celebrating its achievements
         <em>
          while at the same time
         </em>
         worrying about its effects on the natural order around it.
        </p>
        <p>
         In that sense,
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         feels closer to me  as I read the daily accounts of global warmings acceleration and the death of the seas through acidification and over-fishing  than any other ancient book. If were the Omega of civilization, due to our unrestrained exploitation of nature in the name of civilization, then
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         is the Alpha. And thats deep to me  and another reason this classic doesnt suck.
        </p>
        <p>
         And its just the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
         As for the 
         <strong>
          Genesis, Backwards
         </strong>
          thing? Weve seen how
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         is the opposite of Genesis in terms of woman and sexuality (both good), and in terms of most of the Seven Deadly Sins (not deadly, not sins). Now we see another radical difference from the Judeo-Christian in this older religion: In
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         , the gods created nature
         <em>
          and forbade mankind to violate it
         </em>
         . In Genesis, though?

         While there are various ways to interpret this text  and ReligousTolerance.org gives
         <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/tomek30.htm">
          a nicely balanced overview
         </a>
         of those ways  its beyond dispute that the Judeo-Christian-Islamic god comes nowhere close to the Sumerian and Babylonian position on nature in
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         . In this book, nature was not created
         <em>
          for
         </em>
         humanity at all; on the contrary, the gods
         <em>
          defend
         </em>
         Nature
         <em>
          from
         </em>
         us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Wtf indeed. Its an ancient wisdom never more relevant than now.
        </p>
        <p>
         And if you havent noticed, let me spell it out: in my view, the
         <em>
          Tanach
         </em>
         (what Christians call The Old Testament) seems, more and more, to be the polar opposite of
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         . Up to now, Ive been playing with phrases like Adam and Eve, Backwards, and The Seven Deadly Sins, Backwards. But really, since both of those things come
         <em>
          later
         </em>
         than the culture of
         <em>
          Gilgamesh
         </em>
         
         <em>
          and the Biblical Judeans were conquered by the Babylonians, deported by them, and had their temple destroyed by them
         </em>
          it seems far more accurate to call the
         <em>
          Bible
         </em>
         <strong>

            Another great one. I love your observation of Alpha and Omega cultures; I hadnt thought of it that way but of course it makes sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            On an unrelated note, Gilgameshs shaming tactic sounds like something Ive heard from politicians and pundits over the last few years. Good to know that nothing ever changes.

              Interesting, Jack. In his introduction, Mitchell makes connects Gilgameshs moral certainty that Humbaba was evil, and thus deserving of attack, with George Bushs similar god-directed certainty that invading Iraq was the unequivocally right thing to do.

            Hi Clay,
           </p>
           <p>
            I am enjoying this series and the deep exploration of this story, and Im struck by what you point out as the protection of the natural world (not subjugation) and that balance of use and destroy, sacred and utilitarian.  When you wrote that cutting down forests for buildings and mining the earth for gold, silver, and the lapis lazuli so loved by the Sumerians, must have felt a certain fear as they violated Nature for the good of their city life, it made me jump back to the beginning of the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            The storyteller presents Uruk, the walled city made fabulous, and directs our attention to a copper box, latched.  Open the latch, lift the lid, and we see the lapis tablets that this story is recorded on.  Its a story that honors friendship, humanity, nature AND is held in a precious space.  I dont know how Mitchell handles this, but Ive always loved the iamge of the storyteller with the copper box in her hand, sharing a beautiful thing  the story, not the box.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks, again.
           </p>

              Wonderful comment as usual, Kate (and nice to see you and Michael settling into a chat here
              <img alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://beyond-school.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"/>

             </p>
             <p>
              When I started this series, I didnt have a copy of the book, so I skipped that opening paean to the city and the wonderful device you mention of the book in the foundation-stone of the city wall. Now that I have the book (a former co-worker filched a copy for me from my old school  Ill pay for it later), its a bit too late to discuss that. Until the very end, anyway. But lets not give that away, wink wink.

            This may seem trite in the face of what youve been through the past couple of weeks, but at lunch today the issue of life (or whatever) after death came up. And in a flippant moment, I decided to hinge my bets on Hubbles constanteither the universe will continue expanding forever, the Big Bang a one time event, and eventually I will be trillions (?quadrillions) of hydrogen protons wandering about in (mostly) empty space, occasionally bumping into other particles

            Of course, its unlikely the Big Bang comes remotely close to whatever reality reality happens to be, but given thats our cultural context, those were my two choices at lunch today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of the two, I like the former best. Tomorrow I may like the latter.

              I like the latter at this moment because it reminds me of the
              <br/>
              Hindu creation myth and how this world began with the opening of the lotus and will end when it closes  then it will open again
             </p>
             <p>
              But the former speaks of Walt Whitman and his Song of Myself -
              <br/>
              I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,
              <br/>
              And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge but the rim of the farther systems.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
              <br/>
              Outward and outward, and forever outward.
              <br/>
              [...]  There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage;

                Today Im back to hoping for the latter (and since theres no way to know, let me rephrase that as faith in the latter).

                Not sure why I was so fond of entropy yesterday. Lunch in the faculty cafeteria can warp ones perception.

                I need to go revisit the Hindu creation myth. I have a habit of adopting various myths, depending, it seems, on my increasing decreptitude.

              Michael (and Kate), that eternal cycle of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_cosmology" rel="nofollow">
               Hindu-like
              </a>
              Big Bangs reminds me of Nietzsches myth of the eternal return of the same. As physics, I dont think he meant it literally, though Ive seen academics argue he did. I always thought he meant it ethically: live your life like youre fated to repeat it eternally, as a way not to disgust yourself with how youre wasting or compromising it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But then with String Theory and parallel universes and extra dimensions, maybe were all living infinite lives right now without knowing. I cant wait for an interdimensional skype. (And this sounds far dorkier than anything Ive written since my hazy college days
              <img alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://beyond-school.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"/>
              ).
             </p>
             <p>
              Ive been up and down the ladder of ecstasy and misery enough times to want to choose life every time, but eternal sleep is okay too. Buddhism would be okay if its right, since it gives second chances. And I see no way in hell that the universe has such evil in it that there would be an eternal burning-place for people who thought differently or lived botched lives.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now Im going to shut up and drink in the Whitman Kate left us. Damn hes fine. And young Oscar Wilde, I think I recall, once sat, all 6 foot 4 of him, in old Uncle Walts lap, and gave him a kiss. (Lets forget that they both got petty and attacked each other later.)

                Clay and Michael  talk about the universe expanding!  Just imagining that meeting between Wilde and Whitman  might have learned something about more than poetry!

            I havent read Gilgamesh  yet  but find your summary and analysis fascinating.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds like Enkidu &amp; Gilgamesh exchange roles, with the animal advocating morality and the hero desiring destruction.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this world is an anti-Eden, would the protagonists start with the knowledge of good &amp; evil, then surrender this knowledge and sink to ignorance when they taste the forbidden fruit?
           </p>
           <p>
            There is much to ponder here.

              Diane, thats an interesting riff on the Adam and Eve, Backwards idea I played with earlier.

              I cant help but hope that well learn, after fully digesting the consequences of unrestrained use of knowledge that we see around us in the dying modern world (it does seem like its dying, doesnt it?), that well gain a wisdom that allows us to use science in a way thats more wise and less greedy.

            I am totally riveted by these series about Gilgamesh. I read it a couple of months ago, as part of my self-inflicted rediscovering of school-literature. I loved it even then, I can remember, but it was for the things like sex (which at 15 is an excellent topic all by itself) and religion in a very nighttime telly type of way, as E. Izzard would say. Now that Ive read it again, I noticed things about it that were even more interesting then the sole idea of sex socially acceptable and even celebrated (I had outgrown the hormonal stage of my life) or religion as being only an interesting, new thing. This series comes as a confirmation that I had not imagined all of the symbolism and connections to both other ancient and modern literature. Bravo! I applaud this attempt at making Gilgamesh more approachable.

             <p>
              Thank you, Alexandra. The funny thing is  and its the premise of this entire intended series, about most schooly books we slept through in high school 
              <i>
               most
              </i>
              of these books are explosively mind-altering challenges to the simple beliefs at the foundations of our culture today.
             </p>
             <p>
              And we sleep through them because, while were no longer burned at the stake for attacking false idols, were still often fired for it. So we only teach the safe parts.
             </p>
             <p>
              I cant wait to get to Romeo and Juliet, for example.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, thanks again.

                Ooooh, I look forward to your Romeo and Juliet analysis. My peers found it excruciatingly boring, I enjoyed it immensely. Cant wait to see what you have to say.
               </p>
               <p>
                On a different note, Ive often heard it said that teachers have less freedom to, as you say, attack false idols in America than elsewhere. I dont believe that. Im a chip off the old Eastern block, Eastern Europe is where I went to school. And our teachers also slept through various parts of really interesting literature because they were afraid, not of the parents, but the regime altogether. Some classical works were omitted, and some still are.

                 <p>
                  But your point is well-taken. Ideologies, whether religious or political, lead most of us to put on muzzles.

                    I dont think Ive ever been considered to be so interesting as I am here. *chuckles*
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    To answer your question of where: in South Eastern Europe. I grew up in what was Yugoslavia, and now is the Republic of Croatia. I went to high school in the 80s, and things were slowly going downhill even then. It was difficult being a teenager, especially one that was brought up to be free-minded and modern by an extremely liberal family. It was a time when you got punished in school for simply asking a question, not to mention what would happen if you had the gall to openly disagree with the schools policy. Then, in 88 and 89 the tensions in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) escalated. The Yugoslav wars started in 1991 after the secession of most of the constituent entities. The Croatian war of independence lasted for 4 long years (1991-1995), and we were finally able to build our new independent country, if from scratch.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So yes, things have changed since I went to school, and they changed a lot. But still, given that Croatia is a conservative country, with a lot of pressure coming from the Christian Church (especially in the matters of sexual education  which has been the point of many heated debates for the last two years), schools arent permitted to teach what theyd like to, and what, by all accounts, they should teach children. There has been some effort to change the way education here works, but its laughable, if you ask me. There are tons of inconsistencies and some things just dont work like they did before, what with the new age of electronics and Internet.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The new school-reformations barely scratch the surface of the problems our teachers and students face. Things have changed, yes, but there is room for change still. Hopefully, for the better.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I hope I didnt bore you with this long comment, but its difficult to describe the current state of schooling here if you dont understand the background.

            Clay,
            <br/>
            I would like to thank you for sharing this series.  You have shown more interest and passion in just one entry than I remember any teacher ever showing me in the years of my education.  I would have loved to have you as a teacher or professor.  Though, so often, students in college are more dedicated and appreciate their education more than in high school, so appreciate professors more as well.
            <br/>
            All in all, you have made learning about this ancient, classic Gilgamesh most enjoyable.  Thank you again.
           </p>

            Clay,
            <br/>
            Today we learned about Mesopotamia in school and slightly touched on the subject of Gilgamesh. But, from what my teacher said, which wasnt a lot, I knew that I would like it. So today I set out on the Internet and found this series.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just let me say one thing; WOW!!!! This is simply awesome. Thats basically all I can say. Right now I want to read the 2004  translation. But, sadly my town has no copies of it, or any alternate form, within its boundaries. Trust me, Ive been checkin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway this is a simply marvelous series. I cant wait for the next entry.
           </p>
           <p>
            *applause begins*

            Ive read all the posts in this series, and I have to say its refreshing to see somebody with such insight and passion for literature.  It made me feel a little embarrassed when I thought that high school students were making such deep analytic comments in their class, whereas I remember just talking about what the symbols and metaphors were in each story.  I was marginally relieved to find out that it was all just a dream, but I still love your analysis of the story.  I might just have to go out and get a copy of Gilgamesh after reading your posts.

            Hi, I finally read Gilgamesh. I picked it up a while back when I first stumbled across this site and commented way back this past summer.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didnt find this book to be very pro-nature. I didnt get the sense that they were too worried about the environment either
           </p>
           <p>
            Enkidu comes to town to oppose Gilgamesh; Im thinking,Gilgamesh is an ass and is going to get his comeuppance. Enkidu gets beaten, then they fall in love and it turns out the Nature Man part of the equation is a pushover. When Gilgamesh suddenly decides to get Humbaba, Enkidu only puts up a weak argument and caves pretty quickly, hes clearly not the Alpha in the relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Gil goes out from the city, it didnt seem to balance nature for me, it just shows how Gil is extending his territory. Also if you read the story at face value, it almost sounds like they are going to destroy the Cedar forest because they dont like trees or something. I dont recall there being an actual mentioning of using the trees for anything, or of them being valuable. I suppose that would be implied, or that they were so valuable that it would be obvious to a contemporary reader. Perhaps that bit was lost from my frame of reference.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nature in this story gets shamed pretty quickly and thoroughly.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was a little unclear about whether Enkidu ended up balancing Gilgamesh or not. After the fight they left hand in hand and presumably the new bride was left alone, but there was no further mention of Gil lightening up?
           </p>

              Hi Speroni,
             </p>
             <p>
              Shame on me for being so distracted from continuing the Gilgamesh posts. After mid-January life should stabilize enough for me to get back to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good comments here. Let me start by quoting the conclusion to lecture 4:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Ill stop there for now, after this warning: those of you who think, based on this series so far, that Gilgamesh is a text that unambiguously argues that civilization is better than nature, that humanity without limits or divine punishment is good, and so forth?  You have another thing coming.  As we work our way through the changes that both Enkidu and Gilgamesh undergo throughout the rest of this story, I hope youll agree that this ancient story is far more subtle, more disturbing, and to repeat, more wise than we would expect.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I want to riff off that first sentence to say that the epic, to me, is equally ambiguous about Nature. But that gets ahead of the story.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think youre right about Gil not switching roles with Enkidu when they go to the Cedar Forest. But later, Gil dons animal skins to begin his final quest, and that similarity to Enkidu cannot, to me, have been unintended. I think theres a balancing there. More on that later.
             </p>
             <p>
              I dont want to get into my favorite nature motifs until I can do it properly, over an overnight pot of coffee and a close read of the parts that to me clinch the Nature argument, but in a very subtle way.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Cedar Forest episode, though, is definitely one of suspect motives. As I said earlier, its more of an heroic ego-trip for Gil than anything else. (But they do discuss using the cedar to build a gate for the city or a temple, if I recall correctly.)
             </p>

              Hope youll weigh in when I get back to it. The role of Enkidu as a balance, to me, carries through to the end. And the end is what to me is sublime, particularly due to one detail that Im going to keep up my sleeve.

            On an aside I picked up some Sedaris books. I heard about him here, and suddenly he was everywhere. He spoke at my college and then I moved to a different state and he spoke at a venue downtown. I caught a piece on NPR by him. Its like when you learn a new word and suddenly the new word is everywhere.

           <p>
            Anyway his writing is funny. Not so much funny ha-ha, but good. I always find myself trying to figure out where the facts end and the exaggeration begins. Thanks for the suggestion of his work as well.

            I realize this is now going back numerous months, but I wanted to thank you for writing this. I am presently teaching a world literature survey class for undergraduates in Las Vegas, and I found myself very unclear about what Gilgamesh is about. As I was an ESL instructor in a Korean university for several years and have a Korean wife it was amusing to read some of your observations. Many are very true for me as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your ideas about Gilgamesh and Enkidu forming complementary halves is interesting. My students came up with the same idea. It was my assumption that Enkidu blocked Gilgamesh from having sex with the new bride out of simple jealousy Enkidu wanted her himself but it may be out of a sense of innocence which Enkidu still possesses, as you say.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am a Christian and do not want to irritate you or seem disrespectful. Nevertheless, at times I feel you are a little harsh on Judeo-Christian tradition. Much criticism suggests that Genesis follows Gilgamesh and borrows some of its materials, but many argue the oppositethat Genesis predates Gilgamesh as oral tradition and possibly as text (Moses is suggested as literate himself). To me Gilgamesh, while an excellent tale, lacks the precision and detail of the Genesis account, and Utnapishtims story feels like a corrupted and shortened version. At times you seem to apply a contemporary stereotype of Christianity as a comparison. Early Christian scripture is not such a different worldview to that of Gilgamesh. While the Hebrews did not condone temple prostitution, they certainly drank alcohol and had sex, and neither of these acts were described as in themselves sinful. The Hebrews were not body-haters; they had the Song of Solomon.
           </p>
           <p>
            The religious tolerance website is interesting but perhaps a little unfair at times it asks why Genesis is not greener (in comparison to the gods of Gilgamesh), giving only the worst translation of kibbes (subdue, dominate, shepherd). I am not so sure that Humbaba is a sympathetic character; he calls Gilgamesh and Enkidu a moron and an idiot and tries to trick both of them into sparing him so that he can give their flesh to the vultures. Christianity comes from a pre-capitalist civilization of more open land use, and in a faith system based on an ethic of love for your neighbor it should go without saying that despoiling the world for your descendants is not an act of love. This is not to say that the modern church could not do more environmentally; but again, its not helpful to use 21st century AD fundamentalists as a comparison to 21st century BC Sumerians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I enjoyed what you wrote and hope you will have more to say about the rest of Gilgamesh.

            Clay:  This is the most fun Ive ever had reading someones blog.  I do hope youll keep it up.  Its really world class.  Deeply insightful.  Im a recent convert to Gilgamesh myself.  And Im fully in tune with your reading of it.  And I say that despite all the anti-Judeo/Christian barbs, many of which are justified by the crazy inconsistent interpretations and implementations of the biblical materials by Christians and Jews through the centuries.  But simpleminded idiocy is not the exclusive province of any group of people.  I spend the first 15 years of my professional life exploring apparent philosophical problems in Christian theology, and with enough work, always found very deep and subtle answers to apparently hopeless conundra.  But thats off topic here.  You probably have no idea how eager we all are out here to see you continue this series on Gilgamesh, and then  the world.  Im recently reading Beowulf repeatedly, with growing insights from each time through.  Another possibility for your hermeneutical adventuring!
           </p>
           <p>
            Get back to work on Gil!
