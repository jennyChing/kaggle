  <h4>
   <u>
    Background
   </u>
  </h4>
  <p align="justify">
   The Saskatchewan Woodworkers' Guild had its beginnings in 1978
    when a group of woodworkers met informally to share ideas with others who had a common
    interest in working with wood. Since that time the guild has grown to include members from
    all walks of life, both professional woodworkers and hobbyists. Interests of the members
    include all phases of woodworking from carving, turning, marquetry and cabinet
    making to finishing and restoration. We welcome anyone with an interest in
    "woody" things to join our guild.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <u>
    Annual Wood Show
   </u>
  </h4>
  <p align="justify">
   Every year, the Saskatchewan Woodworkers' Guild sponsors a show
    to display the works of its members. This show is open to the public for viewing, and its
    primary purpose is to educate the public and raise awareness of the beauty and diversity
    of works that can be created from wood. A cross-section of the works displayed at the show
    reflects the efforts of both the artisan and the novice woodworker. The annual show also
    provides members with an opportunity to improve their woodworking skills. Preparing a
    piece of work for display provides the motivation to strive for one's personal best and
    expand on their woodworking knowledge. It is also a platform to share the creativity and
    craftmanship with other members and the general public.
     To find out more about the show, check out the

   <u>
    Monthly Meetings
   </u>
  </h4>
  <p align="justify">
   Sharing of ideas and experiences by fellow crafts-people is one of the biggest
    benefits gained by members at monthly meetings. Meetings are held on the third Thursday of
    every month except except July and August. As an introduction to the Guild you are invited
    to attend a monthly meeting as a guest.
