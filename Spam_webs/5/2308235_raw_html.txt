            In June of 2013, the dramatic results of a study performed at the Harvard School of Public Health were released. The study revealed that out of a large subject group (one they had been monitoring for several years), of all the fatalities during that period, restless legs sufferers within the study group had a
            <b>
             40% higher mortality rate

           "New research in the journal Neurology by Xiang Gao, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health, shows that men with Restless Legs Syndrome faced a 40% higher risk of dying earlier than other men in the study.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In their study, Gao and colleagues tracked more than 18,000 men in their late 60s or older for eight years and found that among 690 with restless leg syndrome, 171, or 25% of the men with the disorder, died in that period. Fifteen percent without RLS died.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The exact cause for the disorder or why it would raise a person's risk of dying earlier than normal has yet to be determined. That, Gao says, "is the next question to answer."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Consequently, uncovering the explanation for RLS and its effects has proved tricky, especially when considering patients with multiple conditions. The answer will reveal itself only with more research and time, says William Ondo, professor of neurology at the University of Texas' Health Science Center.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "The issue with these studies is when you look for other confounding illnesses it's always problematic," he says. "It's always going to be debatable.""

            The first thing I need to make ABSOLUTELY clear to you is that your twitching legs (or other body part), whether you want to call it Willis-Ekbom Disease or Restless Legs Syndrome ... is NOT a disease.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Your twitching and rustling is a SYMPTOM of something more dangerous that's going on inside your body, unknown to you - a CHRONIC INFLAMMATION that is constantly growing within.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            RLS is a
            <b>
             biomarker
            </b>
            ... an indicator of a
            <b>
             greater
            </b>
            underlying issue.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A recent study by neurologist Sanford H. Auerbach, MD. of the Boston Medical Center strongly supports this belief.

                 A nationally-recognized sleep expert has published an editorial describing Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) as a possible biomarker for underlying disease. The editorial appears in the March 5, 2015 issue of Neurology the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology and was authored by Boston Medical Center neurologist Sanford H. Auerbach, MD.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 RLS is a disorder of the nervous system. Patients with RLS have uncomfortable sensations in their legs which lead to an overwhelming urge to move them  most often at night or whenever the patient is resting.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The editorial was in response to an analysis of 12,556 men who were followed over time by the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, published in the same issue of Neurology, which showed multiple disease associations with RLS.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Patients with RLS had a higher mortality rate than similar men, and showed an especially strong tendency toward cardiovascular disease and hypertension, said Auerbach, associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine. In earlier analyses of the same data, men with RLS were more likely to be diagnosed with lung disease, endocrine disease, diseases of nutrition and metabolism and immune system problems.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Auerbach suggests that restless leg syndrome is a meaningful biomarker for serious disease, and that RLS screening may become more common as a tool for primary care providers to identify patients at risk.

Instead it sends us little signals (think of them as gentle biological taps on the shoulder) letting us know that something is amiss.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "Physical signs and symptoms are ways your body tries to alert you to deeper imbalances," says Elson M. Haas, MD, a San Rafael, Calif., physician with a natural-medicine approach and author of Staying Healthy with Nutrition (Celestial Arts, 2006). "Taking the time to decipher the body's codes is always better than simply popping a pill and hoping the symptoms just go away. Ideally, we want to get to the causes of problems, not just suppress the end result of ill health."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But interpreting the body's quirky Morse code requires a deep level of body awareness that, like any skill, takes time and practice to perfect."

           Unfortunately, traditional modern medical practices (and some alternative therapies) take the position that illness is an obstacle and should be fought as an enemy attacking the body.

           "The body speaks volumes about what ails it -- from obvious warnings like a fever that accompanies an infection to subtle clues like losing hair on the toes, which can be an early sign of vascular disease.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Some signs that seem alarming may actually be harmless: Bright-red stools are more likely to come from eating beets than from intestinal bleeding. But some that seem minor can warn of a serious disorder. Small yellow bumps on the eyelid, for instance, may be fatty deposits that signal high cholesterol, which in turn raises the risk of heart disease.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Other signs seem to make no logical biological sense: Eyebrows that no longer extend over the corners of the eyes can indicate an underactive thyroid, and a diagonal crease in the earlobe seems to herald a heightened risk of heart attack.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Some body signs can have a confusing range of meanings: Does that bulging tummy signify middle-aged spread or the beginning of ovarian cancer?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The problem is that many of us don't recognize the warnings, even when they're staring us in the face. Medical writer Joan Liebmann-Smith was losing weight rapidly. Her hair was falling out. Her heart was racing, and she couldn't sleep. She chalked up her symptoms to the stress of having a new baby, while a psychiatrist she consulted for insomnia told her to just "count sheep."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Over lunch one day, a relative looked at her bulging eyes and the big lump in her throat and said, "Joan -- you have a goiter!" A blood test confirmed that she had an advanced case of Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to swell and produce too much of the powerful hormone.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "I had all the classic signs, and I ignored them," says Ms. Liebmann-Smith, a medical writer, who resolved to write a guide for laymen to the warning signs of serious illnesses. "Body Signs" -- written with Jacqueline Nardi Egan, a breast-cancer survivor -- came out in 2007 and has since been published in 26 countries.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "We don't want people to panic and jump to conclusions," Ms. Liebmann-Smith says. "But it's important to pay attention to your body. Knowledge is power.""

            Do you really believe in your heart of hearts that the 40% higher than normal mortality rate of the RLS subjects in the Harvard School of Public Health study was due to a low iron count? Or because they had inconsistent dopamine levels?

            No, obviously not. The deaths have NOTHING to do with twitchy legs. The deaths have EVERYTHING to do with the CHRONIC inflammation that resided within these people.

           <br/>
           <br/>
           * One in three adult suffers from arthritis, nearly twice as many only two decades ago.
           <br/>
           * More than 20 million Americans have asthma.
           <br/>
           * More than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies. This number has doubled in the past twenty years.
           <br/>
           * There are 25.8 million people with diabetes, 79 million are pre-diabetic, and 1.9 million new cases were diagnosed in 2010. By the year 2030 it is predicted that 1 in 3 people will have diabetes.
           <br/>
           * Over one million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease.
           <br/>
           * By the year 2105, the CDC predicts 75% of Americans will be overweight or obese.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Unfortunately, many people immediately reach for medication when they have inflammatory symptoms. This band-aid approach of dealing with the symptoms of disease has become pervasive in how chronic conditions are treated in America."

           <br/>
           <br/>
           Chronic inflammation is typically a silent, under the radar, asymptomatic disease - until actual tissue damage and loss of function occurs. There is no single direct test for inflammation. Instead, doctors use indirect methods by measuring blood levels of C-reactive protein, a pro-inflammatory marker and homocysteine levels.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Managing inflammation before it manifests into a recognizable disease is an important key to maintaining one's health. Diet accounts for the majority of the benefits you reap from a healthy lifestyle, and keeping inflammation in check is a major part of these benefits."

           <br/>
           <br/>
           The illnesses/conditions that plague the industrialized nations include allergies, asthma, age-related frailty, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia, depression, diabetes, heart attack, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney disease, lupus, macular degeneration, osteoporosis, periodontal disease, overweight/obesity, skin disorders, stroke and surgical complications.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Surprisingly, modern science has discovered a common denominator to all these conditions, and it isn't germs. It is inflammation. And while germs may be considered enemy aliens who invade our bodies, inflammatory conditions are created by our own physiologic reactions. As Pogo wisely stated, 'We have met the enemy-and it is us.'"

           It destabilizes cholesterol deposits in the coronary arteries, leading to heart attacks and potentially even strokes. It chews up nerve cells in the brains of Alzheimer's victims. It may even foster the proliferation of abnormal cells and facilitate their transformation into cancer. In other words, chronic inflammation may be the engine that drives many of the most feared illnesses of middle and old age."
