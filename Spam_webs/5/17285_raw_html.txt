As a result, Quirky has very little control, if any, over the quality, safety, morality, legality, truthfulness or accuracy of User Content provided by Users.

The Company will make 30% of Product IP Revenue and Product Sales Revenue from Thirty Percent Transactions and 10% of Product IP Revenue and Product Sales Revenue from Ten Percent Transactions available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in the underlying Accepted Product Idea generating the Product IP Revenue and/or Product Sales Revenue.   The Company will make 10% of Product IP Revenue from Convertible Percent IP Transactions available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in the underlying Accepted Product Idea generating the Product IP Revenue, provided however that once the total rewards associated with an Accepted Product Idea reaches $500,000, from that point forward the Company will instead make 5% of Product IP Revenue from Convertible Percent IP Transactions available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in such underlying Accepted Product Idea generating the Product IP Revenue.  The Company will make 3.5% of the Product IP Royalty Base associated with a Convertible Percent IP Royalty Transaction available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in the underlying Accepted Product Idea associated with the Product IP Royalty Base, provided however that once the total rewards associated with an Accepted Product Idea reaches $500,000, from that point forward the Company will instead make 1.5% of the Product IP Royalty Base associated with a Convertible Percent IP Royalty Transaction available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in such underlying Accepted Product Idea associated with the Product IP Royalty Base.  The Company will make 5% of Product Sales Revenue from Convertible Percent Product Transactions available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in the underlying Accepted Product Idea generating the Product Sales Revenue, provided however that once the total rewards associated with an Accepted Product Idea reaches $500,000, from that point forward the Company will instead make 3% of Product Sales Revenue from Convertible Percent Product Transactions available for distribution to those Users who are allocated Influence in such underlying Accepted Product Idea generating the Product Sales Revenue. Because the Company may elect in its sole discretion to cease commercializing any Accepted Product Idea, there can be no guarantee that you will ever receive any payments or actual compensation in connection with participating on the Site or providing User Content even if you participate or provide User Content. Quirky makes no representations or warranties regarding any actual monetary compensation that may be earned in connection with use of the Site or the Services. Quirky's obligation to pay Product IP Revenue, Product Sales Revenue and Product IP Royalty to Users, who are allocated such amounts pursuant to the Site, is limited to paying such allocations based upon Product IP Revenue, Product Sales Revenue and Product IP Royalty that is actually received by Quirky. Notwithstanding any Product IP Revenue, Product Sales Revenue and Product IP Royalty that may be allocated to your account, Quirky shall be under no obligation to distribute such amount to you until such time as the aggregate amount payable in your account exceeds $50. The Company will calculate all payments owed by the Company to a User as set forth above, on a daily basis, based on the previous day's sales of a Accepted Product Idea. All amounts earned by a User shall be rounded down to the nearest tenth of cent. If the total amount that a User earns (including from Convertible Percent IP Transactions, Convertible Percent IP Royalty Transactions, Convertible Percent Product Transactions, Ten Percent Transactions and Thirty Percent Transactions) for the previous day is less than a tenth of penny (e.g. $.001) then such amount shall be rounded down to zero and no amount will be credited to the User. Quirky reserves the right to reset all User accounts, for which the User has not logged in within the prior two years, below $50 to $0 and to write-off all such unpaid amounts and Quirky shall have no liability for any such write-offs. Prior to resetting any such account to $0, Quirky will contact the User associated with the account at the email address associated with the account, and request that the User log into the account within thirty days. If the User logs into the account within thirty days, Quirky will not reset the account balance. Quirky also reserves the right to withhold or forfeit payments due to any User that has breached this Agreement or any of the other guidelines related to use of the Site. The Company will make payments to Users, upon request from Users for payments, by check, ACH, wire transfer (fee assessed to User) or through any other commercially reasonable manner adopted by the Company from time to time. Subject to the foregoing terms, upon the death of a User, Quirky will direct payments associated with the Influence accruing from the deceased User's participation on the Site prior to such User's death, to a replacement payee if: (a) the Person requesting a replacement payee presents verifiable documentation supporting the replacement payee's legal entitlement to the deceased User's payments, and (b) the request for a replacement payee is received by Quirky within one year from the date of the deceased User's death. If Quirky does not receive a request for replacement payee that complies with the foregoing conditions, Quirky may cancel the deceased User's account, and write-off any unpaid amounts, with no liability for any such write-offs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTax Withholding and Quirky Payee Information Form\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all taxes due on any payments made to you in connection with your participation on the Site. The Company will be under no obligation to make any payments to you unless you have properly completed and submitted the Quirky Payee Information Form (the \"QPIF\") and the information required in the registration process related to backup withholding taxes. Backup withholding taxes are a type of withholding for federal income taxes on certain types of income. Quirky may be required by law to withhold these taxes from amounts payable to you unless you are otherwise exempt from backup withholding. US citizens and resident aliens will typically be exempt from backup withholding if they properly report their name and Social Security number to Quirky on the QPIF and that information matches the IRS records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eService Interruptions and Site Changes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuirky reserves the right to interrupt the Site with or without prior notice for any reason or no reason.
