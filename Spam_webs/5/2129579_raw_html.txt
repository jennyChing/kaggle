   <h2>
    Introduction
   </h2>
   <p>
    A few open-source projects are now available to build a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBX">
     PBX
    </a>
    using a regular PC and some telephony equipment such as devices to connect it 
to the phone network (analog or digital), and IP phones to build an IP-based 
telephony system.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are just getting started with telephony, IP or otherwise, I suggest 
you first read up on VoIP so you get familiar with what it is and what it can 
do, and then, set up a test network with Asterisk or sipX.
   </p>
   <h2>
    What to choose?
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Software
   </h3>
   <p>
    As of May 2006, the projects that have the most traction are Asterisk and 
sipXPBX. The former is more well-known as it's been around for a few years now 
while the latter was only open-sourced in 2004.
   </p>
   <p>
    To determine which to choose (or go for another solution, altogether), sipX 
doesn't support so-called FXO cards, ie. PCI cards that connect the PC directly 
to an analog line, so you must get an external box that acts as a bridge between 
the phone network (FXO card) and the  LAN (SIP), or, alternatively, you can 
subscribe to a VoIP carrier so you just need an Internet connection and the 
the carrier handle the IP-to-POTS gateway. By design, sipX 
obviously only knows the SIP protocol, while Asterisk is more flexible. Also, 
both only run on Linux, although an out-dated port of Asterisk is available 
for Windows (but Linux is the platform of choice and where most of the work 
is done.)
   </p>
   <p>
    If you need a PBX application that runs on Windows, here are some of them 
either open- or closed-source. Some are under active development, others seem 
on hold. Some are well supported under Windows, others clearly get less attention 
than the Linux version. Some have active support, while others get lots of questions... 
and few answers. Some compile to native code, others require a run-time (Java, 
etc.):

     sipX
    </a>
    is a next 
generation IP PBX solution offering rich functionality combined with ease of 
use, installation, and administration. sipX is entirely based on the Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and significant attention is paid to standards compliance 
and interoperability."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Prior to releasing the solution into open source, sipX was a commercially 
deployed IP PBX solution called SIPxchange.
    <a href="http://www.pingtel.com">
     Pingtel 
Corp.
    </a>
    continues to market and sell subscription services for SIPxchange 
(or sipX)."
   </p>
   <p>
    "The difference between Pingtel 
and SIPfoundry is comparable to what Red Hat has done with Linux. Open 
source Linux is available from an open source community called Fedora, but if 
you desire enterprise-grade software, support, documentation, training, and 
the confidence you expect from an enterprise application then Red Hat is the 
obvious choice."
   </p>
   <p>
    "All configuration data (users, devices, permissions, dial plans, credentials, 
group policy, CDR data, etc) are stored in a Postgres database."
   </p>
   <p>
    "sipX is a fully distributed system that today consists of 9 independent 
server components"
   </p>
   <h3>
    What FXO cards work with sipX?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Unlike the FXO cards for Asterisk, there doesn't seem to be any PCI card 
that can be used with sipX. Instead, you have to get a stand-alone FXO gateway 
to talk SIP, ie. connect the POTS line to its FXO plug, and connect the device 
to the LAN through which it will talk to the sipX server. This makes sense, 
as sipX is marketed as being a SIP-based product, unlike Asterisk which is protocol-independent.
   </p>
   <p>
    "For additional analog lines in your house we recommend Grandstream 
HandyTone gateways . An FXS gateway is used to connect to the PSTN (e.g. Mediatrix 
1204, Audiocodes, or other)"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Polycom, Snom and Grandstream phones are known to work well. Also Linksys 
/ Sipura phones are good, although not plug &amp; play managed."

   <h3>
    For Asterisk, FXO card or gateway box?
   </h3>
   <p>
    "Unlike a FXO card, the Sipura 3000 has pass thru. If you lose power 
or the server is down you can still receive calls because the signal is passed 
thru from one side of the ATA to the other. As far as I know, no card currently 
support pass thru (if someone else knows please let me know which card does, 
I'm willing to be corrected). The Sipura 3000 cost about $100 it is both a FXO 
and FXS unit."
