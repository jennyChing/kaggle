   Ink runs from the corners of my mouth.
   <br/>
   There is no happiness like mine.
   <br/>
   I have been eating poetry.
   <p>
    The librarian does not believe what she sees.
    <br/>
    Her eyes are sad
    <br/>
    and she walks with her hands in her dress.
   </p>
   <p>
    The poems are gone.
    <br/>
    The light is dim.
    <br/>
    The dogs are on the basement stairs and coming up.
   </p>
   <p>
    Their eyeballs roll,
    <br/>
    their blond legs bum like brush.
    <br/>
    The poor librarian begins to stamp her feet and weep.
   </p>
   <p>
    She does not understand.
    <br/>
    When I get on my knees and lick her hand,
    <br/>
    she screams.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am a new man.
    <br/>
    I snarl at her and bark.
    <br/>
    I romp with joy in the bookish dark.
