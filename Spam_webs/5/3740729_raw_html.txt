         Michael Moore utilizes a word in the title of his new movie to elicit praise and respect from his Left-leaning fans and derision from his Right-leaning critics. Unfortunately for all of us, he uses the wrong word to describe his movies subject matter. Its not capitalism, silly man; its corporatism. Therefore, I refuse to call his movie anything but what its true title should be: 
         <a href="http://www.capitalismalovestory.com/">
          Corporatism, A Love Story
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Lets head to Merriam-Webster to clear this up. Which one of the following best describes America today?
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism">
          <strong>
           <em>
            capitalism
           </em>
          </strong>
         </a>
         : an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corporatism">
          <em>
           <strong>
            corporatism
           </strong>
          </em>
         </a>
         :
         <strong>
         </strong>
         the organization of a society into industrial and professional corporations serving as organs of political representation and exercising control over persons and activities within their jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The correct answer is, of course, corporatism. A key phrase in the definition of capitalism is 
         <strong>
          by investments that are determined by private decision
         </strong>
         . How do government bailouts of private industry reconcile with this definition? They dont. And if you think this is a recent phenomenon then I urge you to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis">
          consider the Savings and Loan bailouts
         </a>
         back in the 80s and 90s.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another assertion in the definition of capitalism that does not compute in America today is that the prices, production, and distribution of goods are supposed to be determined by a free market.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span id="more-7449">
         </span>
         A free market does not exist when we have the Federal Reserve artificially holding interest rates low, heavy government regulation of industries, and government subsidies that bastardize the natural rules of supply and demand. We havent had a free market in the United States for a very long time. Capitalism can not exist without a free market.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have in America is corporatism. And this is the essence of what Michael Moore is railing against in his new film. Unfortunately, he doesnt offer useful solutions because he doesnt even understand the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         The big corporations hire lobbyists to protect their own interests in their respective industries. The lobbyists go to Washington, D.C. and influence lawmakers to pass laws that give special advantage to the corporations. So, in essence what we have is corporations cozy in bed with the government while Joe Citizen sleeps naked on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only sensible solution to this problem is to set the market free. In a free market Joe Citizen consumer has the power. He votes with his dollars. Badly run businesses fail because there just arent enough people voting with their dollars to keep them afloat. Well run businesses flourish and create opportunity for Joe Citizen and higher growth in production for the country as a whole. As a result less people are unemployed and innovation is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certainly some will fall through the cracks and will need help. This is why churches and charitable organizations exist. It is what they do best. They have a more natural incentive to help and will always do a better job than some government program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its strange that Michael Moore believes that more government is the solution to a problem that is being made worse by that very same government. Moore got one out of three right. He is good at telling everyone about the problem. He confuses people by calling the problem something its not. His solution to the problem actually is part of the problem in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Granted, theres never a perfect solution, but there is a best solution. Its the free market silly man, not more government.
        </p>
        <p>

         Yeah I hate when titles are misleading.  Like the time when I read Atlas Shrugged, it had nothing to do with Greek gods or even shrugging for that matter.  I hate dumm peepol.

         Michael Moore is a silly man.  But capitalism, (the 'free market') is an equally silly system.
        </p>
        <p>
         At least for 90% of the nation.  The top 10% who control 80% of the nations wealth are quite justified in supporting it, as they directly benefit from it.  But given that the vast, vast majority of us could never dream of obtaining such wealth, asserting that Capitalism is an unjust mode of economy is, by all means, a valid claim.

         Although, in America we are all created equal, right?

         Sounds like you _are_ buying into your own oppression, and not understanding capitalism, all at the same time.

         I think the biggest mistake people make is to believe or assume that we have capitalism in this country.  (At best we have a mixed economy).

         If capitalism is "silly", then what's a better alternative?

         I'm not buying into buy own oppression.  I fully recognize the extent to which I am being oppressed.
         <br/>
         "I think the biggest mistake people make is to believe or assume that we have capitalism in this country."
         <br/>
         How are we not a capitalist nation?  Please elaborate.
         <br/>
         Regardless, a better alternative would be for people to make money based on the products they produce.  Rather than producing X ammount of merchandise, generating X ammount of profit, and then having the vast majority of the profit that THEY earned stolen from them by the lazy elite, they should get paid for what THEY work for.  The majority of the elite were born into affluence.  It is just a fact.
         <br/>
         In America, those born poor are far more likely to ammount to poverty, and those born into affluence are far more likely to grow up to be rich.
         <br/>
         Is this because the poor are biologically predisposed to be lazy?  That wouldn't make sense.
         <br/>
         As it stands, a black person is far more likely to grow up to be poor than a white person.
         <br/>
         Is this because black people are biologically predisposed to be lazy?  Well, that doesn't make much sense either.
         <br/>
         So if the classes aren't divided on the basis of predisposition, and their not divided on the basis of individual work, than how are they divided?
         <br/>
         On the basis of luck!  On the basis of inequality!  ON THE BASIS OF OPPRESSION!!!
         <br/>
         No offense, but as a white-male it may be hard to discern the nature of your own advantages.  Seriously, though, I don't mean to offend you with that.
         <br/>
         My dad was one of the rare cases that was born into immense poverty and grew up to possess vast wealth.  He is a CEO.  But lucky for him, he was also a white male.  Given the nature of the capitalist system, being white and being male automatically gives you far greater odds of success.  If my dad had been born a poor colored, female, and made all the same life decisions, chances are he still wouldn't be a CEO.  I say this because, statistically speaking the heterosexual white male has the best odds of success in our nation.  Not due to any biological perdisposition that makes them superior, but because that is how a heirarchy is maintained.

        <p>
         Clearly you do not know the definition of Capitalism
        </p>
        <p>
         From wikipedia:
         <br/>
         "Capitalism can be based on the premises of laissez faire, where private individuals and businesses fire and hire wage laborers, or exchange goods and services without intervention from the State hence the terms "unfettered capitalism" or free market."
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, what U.S. Industry is free from intervention from the State?

         I agree we don't have pure capitalism, in the same way that we are not a pure democracy.  But that isn't to say we aren't a capitalist state.  If our economy isn't capitalist, than what do you propose it is?  Yes, there is some government control, and we thereby do not have a pure free-market.  No system of government or economy on this planet is pure, so that seems to be an irrelevant point.  However, regardless of whether or not our country is 100% capitalist in that the government has no intervention whatsoever in corporations, in that pure monopolies can't be formed, and so forth is beside the point.  If there were totalitarian intervention on behalf of the state, we would be communist.  If there were extensive intervention, but not totalitarian, then we would be socialist.  There is less intervention in business in America than in any other country.  Thus, you could say, we are the most capitalist state.  Do deny that our mode of economy is capitalist, due solely to the fact that, while we do have some government intervention but far less in comparison, is silly.  For that matter we might as well never label any system of government or economy, as historically speaking, they never corrospond 100% with the written intentions.  So, Fidel Castro wasn't a communist.  Sweden isn't socialist.  Barack Obama sure as hell isn't socialist either then (not like he was anyway).  Make sure to tell all your conservative friends the good news!  Hell, lets apply the same rule to religion as well.  I suppose Ghandi wasn't a real Hindu then, as while he was devout in most senses, he was emphatically opposed to the Caste System.
         <br/>
         Pure Marxism has never existed.  Yet, we still consider Cuba to be communist.
         <br/>
         Pure anarchism is impossible.  Yet, many indigenous tribes are considered egalitarian.
         <br/>
         We don't have a pure free-market.  But we are still a capitalist nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless, none of that matters, as my point is that capitalism doesn't work because the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.  I'm thankful America isn't purely capitalist.  Then the top 1% would hold even more wealth, while a greater number of hard-working individuals would starve to death due to the inequalities that capitalism creates.

         We are a Corporatist nation, not a Capitalist nation. No we aren't pure Corporatist, and we are nowhere near pure Capitalist. As you imply, these are just labels, but we if we are choosing labels then we should choose them properly.
        </p>
        <p>
         If we had Capitalism the rich would get richer and the poor would have the opportunity to get richer. With Corporatism the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
        </p>
        <p>
         A country where the government has the ability to force CEO's to resign, take over automobile companies, buy majority ownership of banks is not a Capitalist country by any stretch of the imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
         The entire point of the article was to show that calling America capitalist is a misnomer and confuses those less informed into believing that the "free market" is the cause of our troubles when we haven't had a free market (in general) for a very very long time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Obama may not BE socialist, but so far he's certainly implemented some quite socialist policies. Let me add that George W. Bush implemented some of his own quite socialist policies. America is a mix of Capitalism, Socialism and Corporatism (fascism) back in the late 19th century America could be accurately described as "mostly" Capitalist. Today it seems that America could only be accurately described as "mostly" Corporatist/Socialist with a few industries left that actually operate in a "free market".

Third World? no, victims of American  corporatisms bureaucratic "Selection Committee" Just as the Nazis did, company,  corporate, capitalist, figures, directed, hired by the Kings of ROI, the "Shareholders" to protect specifically the ROI of health insurance companies, "select"  not Jews, Europeans, coming off trains at Auschwitz, Americans! All Americans! You and I! In clean, air-conditioned offices, with computers, pretty secretaries, background music, water coolers! Props, to camouflage their deadly duties, on behalf of accountancy equations, not medical considerations, to protect corporate ROI. Daily they "Disenfranchise" Americans, veterans, workers, teachers, pregnant women, Jews too, dying folk, according to the dictates of accountancies profitability equations, set up to extract highest ROI possible. They refuse them all medical care, on behalf of very rich major investment corporations (some even Asian in origin!). The corporations run the "Selection" committees in America, not even the more impartial government! Corporatism, the velvet glove on the iron fist, today in America! Your turn, not regulated by government, your number is so coming up! It is in the accountants equations, the "Least Qualified" on this list are stroked off, the list recalculated, and sooner or later, your numer comes up, on an ever-shortening list of "Liabilities" and an ever increasing ROI for shareholders  the object of the whole game! Corporatism! It killed GM(America) has infested GM(China) will strangle them too, then move onto the African continent to wreak havoc there! Meanwhile, the great lovable American Neanderthal, requiring in one day, just to survive, food to feed an Asian for six days, is left behind, American Capital fleeing America , migrating to Asia, converted to "Yuan" to take advantage of the slave-labor , "Third World" conditions there, has left him a victim, America's many unemployable, reminents of the "Smoke Stack Era" and the "Legacy Workers" of industries lost with the recent Capital flight to Asia, fill soup kitchens, are bused, prepaid, out of New York City, collect in Shanty-Towns on cities outskirts, with humanured garden plots, eating possum, rodents, they catch and foraging in the night, drinking water from culverts they used to proudly pass by in shiny new Chevrolet's, (SEE:

The Great American Lie! to be followed by the "Final Extraction' by the corporatists. The dollar, now that the Capitalists are safe on the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hang Seng stock markets, in Chinese "Yuan" backed by the power of the whole Chinese population! feel it is safe to "Cash in" on the American Neanderthal and his remaining riches by steadily collapsing the American Dollar, even from International Currency status, to worthless paper, robbing the Arab Oil Princes in the process, and killing off Britain's life sources, wounding all  Euro holdings in America and consolidating in "Yuan" where they feel their fortunes safe from retaliation or challenge! With the "Yuan" now the international currency of trade, these corporatists, consolidated in Yuan, will be very rich, and will take on Africa's resources with American Mercenary muscle , much as they did to capture the worlds oil, and Chinese labor! Poor African, won't see it coming, won't know what in Hell hit him, and the Corporatists will own the world!

         We need to get the government to start living by the constitution.  If it wasn't for all the "social programs" that are not within the purview of the Fed. Govt. (Article 1 Section 8) there would be no deficit, there wouldn't be 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities.  If we  would only wake up and realize how far we've strayed from the ideals of the founding fathers, we could actually have a smaller, well-functioning, efficient government that focused on their respective jobs as laid out in the constitution.
         <br/>
         The problem is the narcissistic, self-absorbed, greedy liars that we call congress.  None of them are willing to relinquish one iota of power that they've managed to hoard.  The back room deals, the special interests, the lobbyists,  they all contribute to the corruption of the idea that was The United States.
         <br/>
         If the founding fathers could see what we have become, they would be angry and ashamed that their "great experiment" has been so corrupted, so perverted as to be unrecognizable to them as a "capitalistic republic"
         <br/>
         In fact, it is my belief that if the founding fathers could see what this country was to be come in 200 plus years, they may have decided not to rebel against England and King George, They would probably say: "We're not ready for self-rule.  Look at what a mess of things our progeny perpetrates on a nation born of our blood, sweat and tears!"  "Our struggle for liberty, our suffering for freedom was in vain!"
         <br/>
         But all is not lost.  There is still the chance we can redeem ourselves in the eyes of the founding fathers.  The federal government has too much power.  We need good, honest men to serve in congress that can resist the temptation to become  self-righteous, power-hungry, professional liars, and truly serve their country to get us back on the right course.  Otherwise this "great experiment"  of the people, by the people and for the people shall surely perish from this earth.

         Free market which you had got you in a mess you are now. The free market allowed the formation of such gigantic corporations that started destroying all competition. When your government saw what was going it tried to put it under control with a lot of regulation. But in the end that forced those companies to start influencing the government trough less official channels, lobbyists

         capitalism cannot work without regulation. It breaks down. This is called market failure. The tragedy of the commons is a great example. Even Adam Smith recognized that markets must be regulated. If you do not have regulated markets, you end up with the mafia. With no rules to govern safe play, the economy would simply break down.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not only that, but in some markets the free market is the worst possible solution and instead natural monopolies must replace the free market as is the case of the current state of power production in the US (adding competitors would add infrastructure costs thus raising costs due to doubling the current infrastructure). Railroads were another natural monopoly for individual routes, but I digress.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless, you cannot compare corporatism and capitalism since corporatism entails POLITICAL organization as well as economic and social. Capitalism is ONLY economic and social. While you could argue that our current political system resembles corporatism, it only resembles it in the form of lobbies. Not only that, but corporatism is much more similar to Fascism, and the US is NOT fascist.

         You have it all wrong.  We never had a free market.  Not in any of our lifetimes.  Not since at least the early 1800's.  Corporations were allowed to become gigantic due to the influence, power, and interference of government.

         Well its completely a moronic statement that capitalists are making,  ."Corporatism"  wouldn't have ever been introduced without capitalism, it is a direct birth from the capitalist system.  You cannot have corporatism without capitalism.  Damn politicians just trying to move the blame onto something that should even exist in our minds, to try and make us believe their intentions have our best interests in mind, look at our world today.eventually if we do no step up to the plate and begin to force change then there will be nothing left for our grand children.  Over the last 10 yrs look at how many promises have been kept by politicians.very few, open your eyes stop debating or misguiding information and do something about it.

         Moronic? It seems more moronic to suggest that the abuse of an existing system should be blamed on the system itself as you are doing. Capitalism doesn't *cause* corporatism. Corporatism may be an abuse of capitalism but that doesn't make capitalism a bad system.
        </p>
        <p>
         Your logic is failing. An equivalent argument would be to say that "People don't kill people, guns kill people", which is as absurd as saying corporatism would never have been introduced without capitalism.
        </p>
        <p>
         If our government/lawmakers were to concentrate on investigating fraud and defending contracts instead of bailing out, subsidizing, and worrying about maintaining their power, capitalism would work just fine.
        </p>
        <p>
         No, it would not be perfect, but it's certainly better than what we have now and what is likely to only get worse in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Term limits would help and making our lawmakers accountable for each and every vote would help as well. Unfortunately, it looks like it's going to get much worse, before it has a chance of getting better.

         The author is right. You people here who put down his article are wrong. Corporatism and Monopolism are the problem. A True Free Market Libertarian Constitutional Market capitalism would cure these problems. Street vendors are a great example. As things stand, big business is able to use government power to limit street vendors. If we had a free market libertarian society like I propose, street vendors would be essentially unregulated as far as the right to street vend and set up carts and tables etc goes. If businesses that pay overhead and the rest complain the answer is TOO BAD&gt; FREE MARKET COMPETITION. What would happen? Many out of work people would be able to sell goods from guns and knives and daggers and swords to food and books and clothes and hairpins and appliances and even yes cars on the street without any government saying you cannot do it. Corporate Monopolies only exist when they can use government power to limit the small businesses and others. If government was UNABLE to interfer, then the capitalist free market would make sure monopolies never formed.

         If you understood economics you would realize something. Depressions and recessions are as a matter of fact very good for the economy. Depressions and recessions allows for the reallocation of resources that were previously not in the correct place. This allows for the economy to "fix" itself and come back even stronger than it was before. So your entire argument concerning the mafia is actually false.

         Yeah but if the fed would quit tampering with the economy it might not have to be "fixed" so often.

         Amen brother. It's funny how both Dems and Reps preach about how they believe in small business and will do their all to promote growth of small businesses. But yet there is never one regulation dropped. They are only added. For example, in the city I live in stands and carts and etc are not allowed. Only "permanent structures" are allowed to operate a business out of.  Ridiculous. And the American people just go along with it. Half of them die hard Dems and the other half die hard Reps. Not even realizing neither party gives a damn about real change for the good. One preaches welfare to be the answer and the other preaches security. So what do we get? A welfare state and the military-industrial complex. And nothing ever gets reversed, it just gets added to. Over and over. So long America.
