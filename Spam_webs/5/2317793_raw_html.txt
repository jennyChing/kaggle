        <p>
         Im about to go on a bit of a rant. Truly, Ive been awestruck by the girl-on-girl hate Ive seen in so many places. Think about it for a minute. Why was
         <em>
          Mean Girls
         </em>
         such a popular film? It resonated, with a lot of young women. High school presents the ultimate manifestation of girl on girl hate, captured in many films and experienced by many girls. It doesnt go away over the years as women translate their competition into the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
         I once held a job where my boss made horrible comments about nearly every woman in the office, behind her back of course. She would criticize Lyndseys outfits, Sarahs work ethic, and Rachels hair, all while placating them with charming words and big hugs every time she saw them. It was an ultimate Regina George moment.
        </p>
        <p>
         She also went after women professionally, eager to find a slip-up among
         <em>
          any
         </em>
         woman who worked for her. Once she did, she would bring in the big boss, and discuss the problem in front of him rather than directly with the individual who made the mistake. Even if the mistake wasnt actually a mistake at all, but a misunderstanding, she was eager to leverage her power and take down another woman. She was the reason that the one woman who supervised her, an inspiring, successful, and all-together amazing person, was ultimately let go. It was devastating to watch, because I knew she didnt deserve it.

         <b>
          The Science Behind It?
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         It could actually be science that keeps some women from being supportive of one another.
         <em>
          Psychology Today
         </em>
         cites
         <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-is-2020/201309/women-who-hate-other-women-the-psychological-root-snarky">
          several studies
         </a>
         that indicate women may be more inclined to pick up on social exclusion, and exclude other women in return. Women are also more likely to engage in relational aggression, rather than physical aggression, which men are more apt to partake in. Physical aggression is certainly more difficult to act upon in the workplace, but relational aggression is easy to partake in. Its subtle, its quiet, and its intuitive for many females. A 1998 study by Nicki Crick found that girls as young as ten years old were more likely to be relationally victimized than boys.

         Its even scarier when this kind of girl-on-girl aggression actually
         <em>
          becomes
         </em>
         physical, as it did with me in Krav Maga. A woman literally hit me, repeatedly, while I was working with another individual. She refused to stop when I told her to, didnt think twice when I didnt hit her back, and proceeded to hit me in the head
         <em>
          hard,
         </em>
         even though weve beentold many times that to get another persons attention to engage, we should hit them below the neck.
        </p>
        <p>
         She took another girl to the ground, prepared to bash her head against the wall, until that girl yelled out. The instructor told the woman to stop, and she didnt. It seemed, well, psychotic. I know it was targeted because she responded to the men with minimal aggression and flirtatious conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Seeing the cruelty that woman subject each other to become physical was a stark reminder for me that in a world where things still arent equal for women (think wage gaps, getting passed over for promotionsthere are all kinds of statistics on gender inequities in the workplace), women arent exactly helping matters. Were supposed to stick together. Instead, were going out of our way to undermine one another. I know its a competitive thingits an Alpha Female gamebut why does it have to be that way? Cant we still succeed, without physically, emotionally, or professionally hurting someone else?

         Somewhere along the way, I lost my dream to write. In between the Hollywood fantasies, the desire to make lots of money, and the endless writing workshops in my high school Literary Arts program, I came to believe that writing was not for me anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many famous actors, singers, dancers, writers, and even people in technological fields begin young. Ive been dancing since I could walk, theyll say. Ive been in plays since elementary school. Ive always known I was an actor. They hone their crafts early on in life, knowing, subliminally, that this is what they love and were meant to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of us stop listening to that little kid somewhere along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of us forget what we once loved.
        </p>
        <p>
         We forget that the childs picture of their future was never colored by the promise of fame and fortune. The person we were had yet to become exhausted from hours of recitals or rehearsals or workshops. They just knew what they wanted, and they did it.
        </p>
        <p>
         It might take other people to remind you of what you loved, wanted to, and needed to do. I got that reminder just last week. Even though Ive started writing again, doing that thing I always loved and always did until I didnt anymore, Ive been insecure about it. Ive been anxious when people ask me what I do all day, Ive been worried about paychecks from clients who dont pay on time, and Ive gone stir-crazy being in one place (my own head) for hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then, some of you amazing readers reminded me that Im doing the right thing. After I wrote an article for Elite Daily, called
         <a href="http://elitedaily.com/women/recover-from-eating-disorder/1054763/">
          Why Its So Damn Hard To Recover From An Eating Disorder In Our Society
         </a>
         , I received Facebook messages thanking me for being so honest, and confessions from other people who have struggled and encountered the same problems with our society today. People commented on my article (for some reason the comments have been removed) sharing some of their own experiences, and in a truly it came full circle moment, one of the eating disorder facilities I was going to go to, The Bella Vita, retweeted me and thanked me for being so honest.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank everyone else for reading my writing, and responding so positively. Being so honest really isnt that difficult anymore. Because people have responded so positively to my blog and my articles, I feel encouraged. I want to help other people, and the positive feedback Ive gotten from complete strangers everywhere from New York to California to Europe has reminded me that I can make a difference to others while doing that thing I always loved doing as a kid. I have to thank you, all of my readers, for helping me go back to what I was meant to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         A special shout out to the girl who immediately shut down a comment on my Elite Daily article that eating disorders are a choice, and our society doesnt understand them because it is a self-inflicted problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you for reminding me to do what I love. I want all of you to remember to do the same, even if its not professionally. Find a way to do it in your spare time, or take the risk and pursue it as a career. Even if feedback isnt positive, push through until it is. If youre doing what you believe you were meant to do, one day, it will be.

         Unfortunately, when you keep moving around, it makes it
         <em>
          way
         </em>
         too hard to make new friends. Even when you arent a military family, it can be hard as you get older to forge new friendships.
         <em>
          Thats why I recommend to every military spouse, especially the younger ones who dont have kids like myself, that they find some sort of organized activity to do.
         </em>
         Whether its going to a workout class on the regular (like Crossfit or Krav Maga), going to church/synagogue/whatever place of worship applies to you, or volunteering regularly with one organization, these kinds of activities can really help you foster new relationships. The trick is going in without any expectations, and letting relationships develop naturally. Just like dating.
        </p>
        <p>
         I feel so fortunate that I discovered a group of friends in just this way. Moving around has been very difficult, largely because it took us 3000 miles from most ofour friends. Ive been lucky in that we moved back to the DC area, near where I grew upand prior to that lived on base. But we still live far from any of my high school friends, and without finding some kind of activity outside of work, I dont know how many valuable friendships I would have.
        </p>
        <p>
         These pictures are from a camping trip we took this past weekend with our friends from Krav Maga. It was a Wilderness Survival Course, taught by one of my favorite Krav instructors, but we spent most of Saturday night just talking, playingCards Against Humanity, and drinking lots and lots of beer. It was perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          The other wonderful thing was that we werent surrounded by other military families.
         </em>
         This is my other trick: spending lots of time with people who have little to no connection to the military. Its refreshing to feel completely normal once in a while, and just be around people whose lives are different from yours. You can learn from them, you can forge friendships without worrying that they are leaving soon, and you can talk about something other than deployments, PCSing, and TDYs. It gets old fast.

         I think its truly special when you have people you can talk to from 3 pm until 2 am, then chat with more the next morning (or really just 4 hours later). Thats what this experience provided. I didnt take many group shotswe were too busy losing to the two quiet ones, Kevin and Nick, during Cards Against Humanity. Its always the sweet, polite, shy guys who win that game!
        </p>
        <p>
         All I can say is, as much as you may want to be mourn over the friendships youve left behind, and watch everyone hang out without you on Facebook, you just have to get back out there. Not necessarily in the wilderness, but in whatever capacity you most enjoy. Believe me, no matter how introverted you are, you can find new friends wherever you go.

         Its been a while since Ive shared some of my latest writing with you all, so I thought I would take the time to do so! These are some of my favorite couple of pieces that have been published of late in the news and lifestyle genres.

         More Memorial Day weekend pics, to remind you that theres nothing quite as soothing and rejuvenating as a walk in the woods far away from city life. If you want to get away to the woods, I highly recommend a trip to southern Virginia, about five hours from Arlington, VA and near the North Carolina border.
         <span style="color: #ff0000;">
          Warning:
         </span>
         You
         <em>
          will
         </em>
         be far away from civilization, as I learned the hard way when I got extremely congested from allergies,and Kevin had to drive me 40 minutes to the nearest Food Lion for medicine. When youre sick, this is
         <em>
          way
         </em>
         too far.
         <span style="color: #ff0000;">
          Warning #2:
         </span>
         Dont drive on country roads when nauseous from said headache. I learned the hard way that this just means youll be stopping every five minutes to throw up, especially if youre in a bumpy, manual transmission Jeep.
        </p>
        <p>
         I may not be the quintessential country girl just yet, but Im getting there.

         Before I get into the photos, I wanted to share this wonderful TED Talk that a friend of

         Kevin and I are off to a friends cabin this weekendin the middle of nowhere. We plan to bring the dogs, so Ill have lots of pictures of dogs running into lakes(and hopefully not getting bit by the rumored snap turtle in one of them), Kevin and I doing target practice (yes, this girl can shootkind of) with watermelons, supposedly beautiful hikes, some wine tasting, some bbq, and who knows what else. Hopefully there are no bearsbut apparently they do appear in the area. Wish us luck. Ill be back soon to share our excursion, which I think is a perfect way for us to reconnect after Kevins long Hawaii trip and a stressful couple of weeks back in DC.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tank also has a new life vest hell be wearing in the water. Not that he needs it, but I think it looks hilarious. Dont worry, there will be pictures. Unless Kevin makes me take it off of Tank. He tends to refuse to movewhile wearing it. I think hes embarrassed by the handle on the top, which allows me to pick him up likea purse. But I digress

         Since I assum that a lot of you mighthave some down time this weekend, I wanted to postan excerpt from my book on ways to make the most of your spare moments. This is especially geared at military spouses looking to find new, inspiring things to do while their significant other is deployed or away, but really, were all the same and were all looking for awesome ways to improve our lives. Heres an excerpt from a chapter in my book(which I just finished, but is now in the editing stages) called

          Finding Happiness  Daily Inspiration for Milspouses

          I wake up every morning in silk pajamas, and stretch on my luxurious cashmere sheets. I do yoga as the sun rises, and then eat a healthy and filling breakfast of quinoa oatmeal.

        <p>
         <em>
          As I ride to work on the Metro, I read inspiring quotes and listen to an audio book about how to live a more fulfilling life. Its all in a days work for me. I find inspiration everywhere.

         <br/>
         <em>
          Ok, well I hope you know that was a joke, a description of an ideal day where spirituality and inspiration surround me. The reality is, finding things that are inspiring and motivating can be a little bit harder than that. We dont have all the time in the world, or even half as much as we probably want.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Everyone could use a little inspiration in their day to day lives; military spouses sometimes need a little extra. We spend a lot of time managing the lives weve built with our service members on our own, which gives us a lot less free time, and a lot less stamina to get through the day. Its always worth it, but that doesnt always make it easier. There are lots of little ways that myself, and other military spouses Ive met, find ways to make it through each challenge that military life presents. Finding happiness in each day is a great way to start. So even if youre short on time, try these little tricks that seem to work for other milspouses:

         <strong>
          Get Connected 
         </strong>
         Go to Facebook and find a military spouse group in your area. Try typing X Name of Military Installation  Military Spouses in the search engine box on Facebook. Something should come up either for your installation, or a nearby one. Reach out to these ladies with a simple post along the lines of, Hey, Im new to the area and would love to get to know some other spouses. Anyone else here enjoy X,Y, or Z activity/tv show/hobby? A lot of these other ladies are looking to connect as well!

         <strong>
          Take a Fitness Class
         </strong>
          Its easy to get caught up between work, family life, and other household responsibilities. If you go to a fitness class, youre forced to spend time doing something else. Find a fitness activity you enjoy, like yoga or cycling, and give yourself some me time. With a class, its like an appointment. You cant put it off, especially if youve already paid for it. So just go!
        </p>
        <p>
         For that matter, getting out and being busy in any fashion helps. Interactions with a a variety of people can be a welcome distraction, and a comfort, when your spouse is deployed or working long hours. Being busy helps detract focus from the negative, and transfer focus to something more productive like community service or connecting with new people.

        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Go to spouse events 
         </strong>
         Join a Spouse Club, or sign up for emails about when they are having get-togethers for spouses. Especially if you live on base, you may feel strange when your neighbors all seem to know each other well and you just know them from a morning wave when you both go get your newspapers. They may both be in Spouse Clubs, or involved in base events. Its so easy to say, Thats not for me. I dont like hanging out with military spouses. I said it for a long time. But now that I dont live on base, I really miss what I had when I did live there. I didnt join a Spouse Club, but I did get to know my neighbors and befriend the wives of my husbands coworkers. They lived on or near base, and it made everything just, well, easier. Believe me, most military spouses are not catty or exclusive. Like you, theyre eager to make friends. At least try it, see what you find.

        </p>
        <p>
         Go to Pinterest or Tumblr. There are LOTS of quotes for military spouses listed on peoples boards. Theyre often accompanied by some great photography, and sometimes fun stories from the spouses who post them. One of my favorites is a post from the Military Moments Tumblr that is truly something only a milspouse can relate to. It reads, Waking up and immediately checking your phone, Facebook, email, or Skype hoping to have a message from them. Print some of these out, and frame them or attach them to a corkboard at your desk. Look at them when youre feeling down, and remember, you are so not alone.

         <strong>
          Remind Yourself, This Cant Last Forever
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Everything in the military is fleeting. You dont live in a place for long, you dont have the same friends for long. So this mantra will get you through the bad, and help you appreciate the good. One military spouse I spoke with reminded herself that it wouldnt last forever when she was flying cross-country with one teething baby, and another on the way, all while her husband was deployed.

         <strong>
          Let It OutFeel It
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Several military spouses have admitted that they just let themselves cry it out. One told me that when her toddler cries about missing her father, sometimes, she joins her. Its okay to miss your loved one, its normal to cry about it, and you might just feel better doing so. I know that every few weeks, I can use a good cry. It just feels cleansing.

          Leave Work at the Door
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         If your spouse is stressed, it may transfer to you too. If you know he needs to talk it out, its great to be there to listen. At the same time, dont let every night be a gripe fest where the time you spend together is spent complaining about work. As military spouses, our time with our loved one is limited already. So make the most of what youve got and enjoy each other.

         I hope this helps a little bit, especially when you get overwhelmed even during the downtime you have during this holiday weekend. I hope all of you enjoy your Memorial Day weekend, whether you are sharing it with a service member or your friends and family!

         I previously covered my springtime projects in a Friday Fixes post, available to read
         <a href="http://visionsofjillhanna.com/five-friday-favorites-its-springtime/">
          here
         </a>
         . There have been some really exciting updates to the garden that I wanted to share. The plants havent grown so tall that you can easily see them against the weed-blocking tarpyetbut I wanted to share their progress. If I can make this whole gardening thing work, even after annihilatingtwo basil plants, the cactus in my house, and a batch of seeds, you can too! I hope this provides some inspiration for you for your own springtime endeavors. I also want to point out that gardening is a
         <em>
          great
         </em>
         way to save money on herbs, fruits, and vegetables that otherwise cost a pretty penny at your local grocery store. We purchased most of our plants from a nearby nursery. It seems to me that nurseries as a whole take much better care of their flowers and plant life than Lowes or Home Depot.

          Part 1: Bring the Outside In
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         Before fully establishing the garden, I wanted to make sure I could enjoy the fruits of springtime indoors as well. So I started to buy fresh flowers on a weekly basis at Whole Foods, Trader Joes, or Giant and put them in small milk bottle vases in my bathroom, bedroom, office, and kitchen:

          Part 2: Save With Seeds
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Growing fruits and veggies from seeds was part of my initial effort to both save money, and truly be able to say that I started my garden from scratch. Unfortunately, this cool little greenhouse that came with dirt pockets for the seeds didnt work out so well. The lid kept coming off in the rain, and the tray would then fill with water and flood the seeds. It looks like some of them fell out of the dirt, and others just drowned. Unfortunately, taping the tray on wouldnt have helped the problem, because then I wouldnt have been able to water the seeds at all. So I say, skip the tray and either plant seeds in small pots (which is what I plan to do now) or buy the plants at a nursery, plant them in your garden, and help them flourish!

          Part 3:Make your garden
          <span style="color: #ff0000;">
           Warning  This is actually pretty labor intensive
          </span>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Turn over the soil
         </li>
         <li>
          Ensure more weeds dont grow by covering the turned over soil with weed-blocker tarp
         </li>
         <li>
          Section measured-off portions of the garden to ensure adequate spacing for each plant (go off of what it says on the packaging the plant comes in). Be sure to label each section so you remember what youre growing, and always check compatibility between plants online (some dont play so nicely with others).
         </li>
         <li>
          Dig holes in the tarp where you can put your plants
         </li>
         <li>
          Pop in those beautiful tomato, zucchini, cucumber, green bean, and watermelon plants!
         </li>
         <li>
          Surround your garden with marigolds, which supposedly ward off pests (it seems to be working so far)
         </li>
         <li>
          Plant strawberries separately. Apparently, they grow large and spread quickly. Well move them out of the pots once they start to get bigger.

         I found this fun bucket in the Dollar Spot at Target, and will use it to collect lemon balm, mint, strawberries, and cherry tomatoes as they grow.

        </p>
        <p>
         Once I gathered some lemon balm from my garden, I put it in a pitcher to make infused water. It tasted herbal and refreshing. Theres something extra satisfying about a drink or meal when you know it came from a garden you grew yourself!

         Last Monday, I got to do something unforgettablesomething that I hope will be an annual routine for me for years to come. I was able to spend the day with my best friend Sheryl, who Ive known since I was 2 years old (thats right, Ive known this girl almost 26 years). We drove around in a golf cart for hours, keeping golfers hydrated and selling raffle ticketsto raise money for wounded warriors. I spoke about the cause behind Miracle 4 Melanie

         I finally have some pictures to share of the event! But before I do, I want to give a shout out to Erica Strudler, the woman behind Miracle 4 Melanie. She may be my age, but shes someone I look up to immensely. Erica is not only beautiful on the outside, but on the inside. She has a heart of gold and welcomed me right away with an awesome Miracle 4 Melanie Under Armour jacket, a goodie bag, and an introduction to her incredibly sweet father Lew, who wasthe Senior Director of Corporate Partnerships for my beloved Washington Capitals! His connections in the area enabled him to involve the Caps and the Washington Wizards in the event, bringing even more attention (and fun) to an amazing cause.

         , CIO of Walter Reed, Ericas friends and family, volunteers from the Paley Rothman law firm, the pro athletes who golfed,and the mascots for the Wizards and Caps. Shoutout to poor G. Whiz, whom I tormented with my praise of the Lakers because he couldnt talk back. I guess I deserved him kidnapping me in my own golf cart

         Happy Military Spouse Appreciation Day, everyone! I know I havent blogged in about a week, and I do apologize. Fortunately, theres good reason. In addition to lots of work, I was also involved in a charity event for wounded warriors that I will be sharing much more about on Monday. I was also brainstorming some new blog ideas, and plan to feature more spring updates in and around the home (including the garden Ive been working hard on), more tips for young professionals, a Q&amp;A about military life featuring my service member husband, and more!
        </p>
        <p>
         But today, I want to focus on Military Spouse Appreciation Day, which sounds like a silly holiday. I mean, shouldnt we appreciate military spouses all of the time? What does this kind of day actually mean? Well, I see it as a day to sit back and think about how much service members do, then think about how much of this is because they have incredible spousesbehind them. These are men women I admire because they have kids, jobs, houses, animals, themselves, and their significant others to think of. To be honest, I can barely manage 3 weeks without my husband and I have flexible hours, have two dogs, and parents who live 2 hours away. Thats why, even as a military spouse, I most admire the military spouses who are responsible for so much, have husbands who are gone for much longer, and who still manage to keep things running. I know its not always easy, but they make it look easy!
        </p>
        <p>
         In honor of these men and women, I wanted to share some of the best social media posts, pictures, and videosthat Ive seen today honoring military spouses!
