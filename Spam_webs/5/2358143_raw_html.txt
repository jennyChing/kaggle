          Cast iron is one of the most versatile cooking materials. Its durable, conducts heat very well, and can cook almost anywhere  from stove to oven and grill.
         </p>
         <p>
          Cast iron gets a bad rap because it is notoriously hard to take care of. Let us dispel the rumors: seasoning the cast iron by adding a layer of polymerized oil is pretty easy and protects the surface.
         </p>
         <p>
          The process consists of repeatedly rubbing the cast iron with oil, heating it up, and cooling it down. This process breaks down the oil into a plastic-like substance that bonds to the metal, creating a slick surface thats perfect for cooking. A well-seasoned cast iron pan will be nearly non-stick.
         </p>

          While iron is a reactive metal, its nothing to worry about. Reactive metals can cause off flavors and discoloring when mixed with certain foods, including anything very acidic or alkaline. However, if a cast iron pan is seasoned properly, the occasional run-in with a few tomatoes or a splash of lemon juice shouldnt hurt, so long as theyre not simmering for hours on end.

          <b>
           How to clean it:
          </b>
          After cooling, clean cast iron gently with a bit of soap and water. Gently remove any stuck-on food with a plastic scrub sponge. Do not use steel wool, as this will ruin the seasoning. Immediately dry the pan. After each use, re-season: Place the clean pan over a burner on high. Heat until residual water dries up. Add a teaspoon or two of vegetable oil and rub it around the cooking surface using a paper towel. Heat until the oil starts to smoke. Once smoking, take the pan off the burner and rub the oil around once more. Let the pan cool, and store.

          Enameled cast iron offers many of the same benefits of classic cast iron, but without the hassle of seasoning. Plus, its much more attractive, and most models come in a wide array of colors. The only downside: enameled cast iron is significantly more expensive. The upside? Because the iron pot is lined with ceramic enamel, these items are non-reactive, meaning that home cooks can simmer tomato sauce without worry.
         </p>
         <p>
          Enameled cast iron pots are heavy and take a while to heat through, but they do retain heat extremely well. These characteristics make enameled cast iron great for browning and transferring from the stovetop to the oven.

          Soap and water should do the trick. For tough spots, soak the pot with some soap and water, and gently rub it away with a plastic scrub brush. Do not use steel wool or other abrasive cleaners or tools. Most often, enameled cast iron is dishwasher safe. However, repeated dishwasher use can wear away at the coating.

          Stainless steel is non-reactive, durable, dishwasher-safe, and resistant to rust, corrosion, scratching, and denting. Its also pretty easy on the eyes. However, on its own, stainless steel is a terrible heat conductor. The key to finding good stainless-steel cookware is to pick a model that has a core of another type of metal that conducts heat more effectively  most often aluminum or copper.
         </p>
         <p>
          Aluminum-core pots and pans are more affordable than copper-core. However, copper is a slightly better conductor of heat compared to aluminum, which explains the price difference. Copper-core pans react more quickly to temperature changes, giving the cook more control over the cooking process.

          Think of carbon steel pans as a cross between cast iron and stainless steel. They are typically about half the cost of stainless steel and twice the price of cast iron.

          </a>
          Like cast iron, carbon steel pans need to be seasoned and get better with age. They should never be left sitting in water or put in the dishwasher.
         </p>
         <p>
          Carbon steel baking pans and woks are pretty easy to find, but frying pans can be a bit trickier (look at cooking supply stores or online). While carbon steel frying pans and woks behave more like cast iron and must be cared for similarly, carbon steel baking pans are typically coated with a nonstick or stick-resistant layer, which makes them easier to maintain. Adhere to manufacturer instructions for proper care.

          Copper is a fantastic heat conductor, which is one of the reasons that copper cookware is more expensive than its competitors. Copper heats and reacts to temperature changes quickly, giving the cook more control and making it easy to cook food evenly. Because copper is a reactive metal, it must be lined with another material, such as stainless steel or tin. There are some non-lined copper cookware pieces on the market, but these are specifically meant for sugar cookery, in which reactiveness is not an issue.

          While copper is not ideal for high-heat cooking, this is not a huge downfall. Because its so good at retaining and distributing heat, there is generally no need for a high flame.

           Anodized aluminum pans are a less expensive alternative to stainless steel, so, depending on what is already in your kitchen cabinets, a set of frying pans (varying sizes) may be a good addition. Consider an anodized aluminum roasting pan with rack, as well. Aluminum is also used to improve the heat-conducting characteristics of steel baking pans  start with a set of large sheet pans.

          Because raw aluminum is an extremely soft and reactive metal, it must be processed in certain ways before its used as cookware. Anodized aluminum  which makes up the majority of the aluminum cookware out there  has been treated with a chemical process to harden the metal and make it non-reactive.

          Aluminum is also a popular material for bakeware, but it is almost always paired with another type of metal to increase durability. Aluminized steel baking pans and sheets are very popular among professional bakers thanks to their durability, great heat transfer, and corrosion-resistance.

          While non-stick pans are not ideal for all jobs, they do have their place. They allow cooking with less fat and are also much easier to clean compared to other non-lined metal cookware.
         </p>
         <p>
          Non-stick pans can be made from the same types of metal as other cookware  stainless steel, aluminum, and copper, for instance. The only difference is that the cooking surface is coated with a non-stick compound. The most common metal for non-stick pans is anodized aluminum because it is lightweight, affordable, rust-resistant, and a good heat conductor, which means that it reacts quickly to changes in cooking temperature. Teflon, a nonstick coating made from food-grade PTFE, a.k.a. polytetraflouroethylene, is the most commonly found non-stick coating, though other more eco-friendly options have gained popularity in the last few years.
          <a class="js_citation" href="http://www2.dupont.com/Teflon/en_US/products/safety/what_is_it.html">

          </a>
          While nonstick coatings, specifically Teflon, have gotten a bad rap because of safety concerns, the majority of research on the subject says that non-stick pans are safe as long as theyre not overheated.
          <a class="js_citation" href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/product-reviews/cooking-tools/cookware-reviews/nonstick-cookware-safety-facts">

          </a>
          (When overheated, the coating may begin to break down, releasing toxic particles and gasses, some of which are considered carcinogens.) Over time, the coating on non-stick pans can begin to flake off. When this happens, it is time to replace the pan. However, while it may be a bit disconcerting to know you may have consumed a few flakes of chemical coating, no research has shown that it can cause you harm.

           How to wash it:

          Do not use steel wool or any other abrasive cleaners on non-stick pans. Soap, water, and a soft sponge should clean up most messes. Remove any stubborn spots with a plastic scrub brush. Most non-stick pans are dishwasher safe, but check with the manufacturer to be sure. Regardless of the instructions, repeated dishwashing can wear down the lining over time.

           Nonstick coating can have a short lifespan depending on the brand and how long its cared for. Most companies claim that non-stick pans will last a lifetime, or at least 5 to 10 years, but in practice, most cooks find that they replace non-stick pans every 2 to 4 years.

          Glass baking dishes are versatile and make a great addition to any kitchen. Glass is non-reactive and conducts heat very well, which allows for great browning. While this is a desirable feature for savory casseroles where the browning of cheese or noodles is key or for pies where browning the crust is important, sugar-heavy dishes can over-caramelize in glass baking dishes. Glass baking dishes also work just fine for roasting vegetables or meats.

          Ceramic baking dishes come in many shapes and sizes. Ceramic heats up gradually, so it is ideal for dishes that need slow, even cooking (think custards or baked noodle dishes such as lasagna).

          </a>
          Ceramic is also non-reactive, so it is perfect for cooking acidic and alkaline foods, as well as storing food after baking. Ceramic baking dishes are also visually appealing, making them a great option for oven-to-table serving.

           How to clean it:
          </b>
          For extra-dirty ceramic dishes, wait for dish to cool. Soak with water and soap until residue releases from pan. Scrub stuck-on spots with a plastic brush or sponge. Most ceramic is also dishwasher safe.

          In recent years, all sorts of silicone baking products have hit the market, from pan liners to muffin tins and cake pans. The one must-have silicone oven product is the pan liner or mat. These liners allow cookies, galettes, and pizzas to slide right off without sticking. Outside of the oven, these mats are great for rolling out dough without excess flour to prevent sticking. Silicone muffin pans or other silicone molds are also helpful for no-bake treats, such as chocolate mousse bombs. Though silicone bake ware is generally nonstick, it can sometimes be hard to un-mold certain recipes, and they can be a pain to wash clean. Avoid products with waffled or textured interiors. The more textured the surface is, the harder it will be to clean.

           How to clean it:
          </b>
          Soap, water, and a soft sponge should do the trick. Silicone baking molds are also dishwasher safe.

           Prevents sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
           Usually easy to remove baked items from the mold. However, edges and corners can sometimes get stuck.
          </li>
          <li>
           Dishwasher safe. However, a trip through the dishwasher alone may not remove all of the residue from the mold.
          </li>
          <li>
           Great for homes with limited storage space, as they can be folded up and tucked away.

         <ul>
          <li>
           Poor heat conductor.
          </li>
          <li>
           Baked goods tend not to brown well; this can be good or bad, depending on the recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
           Can be frustrating to clean. While nothing really sticks to the silicone, there is always a slight film left, which can be hard to completely remove.
