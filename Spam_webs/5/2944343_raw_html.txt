           This piece is a glance into the mind of a young professional trying to build a prosperous careerthe journey to doing what I love for a living. Just like many other young professionals who have recently started their careers, I dont know exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. What I do know is that I want options. I have many thoughts, ideas, and inspirations throughout the day, and considering that I work a full-time job as a technical writer while trying to keep a social life, its very difficult to keep track of everything that runs through my mind. This is an attempt to add a bit of organization to the chaos, as well as an opportunity to give others an inside look at what goes through my mind as a young professional. At the very least this will help me make sense of my thoughts on what I want career-wise, and what I plan to do to reach my goals.

           Figuring It Out
          </h3>
          <p class="graf--p" id="5859" name="5859">
           It took a while for me to find my calling.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="6093" name="6093">
           Between the ages of five and ten, I had already planned to be a professional soccer player. However, if that didnt work out I always had backups: a paleontologist, an engineer, a sports therapist, an astronomer. Ive always been one who plans and calculates the risks ahead of time.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="c977" name="c977">
           By the end of high school, I stopped playing soccer competitively, ruled out everything I planned for myself throughout childhood, and fell back on a skill that I unexpectedly excelled atwriting.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="7c21" name="7c21">
           I started college as a journalism major with hopes of working for a modern publication, and though I had determined my niche, I still wasnt sure I could dedicate myself to writing for the next 30-plus years of my life. After two years of general education classes and a couple collegiate migrations (USF, Miami-Dade, and finally UCF) I buckled under my heavy interest in technology and decided to give Computer Science a shot. I almost failed miserably. For the record, I would like to point out that, though compared very often, writing code and writing text are not synonymous.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="939b" name="939b">
           Finally, I sat down and compared my interests with my strengths to come up with a career track that I would stick with, at least for the remainder of my Bachelors degree. I crossed what I was interested in (technology) with what I was good at (writing) and came up with technical writing. Makes sense right? At the time though, I had no idea it was a legitimate career.

           See, for some people a career path comes easily. There are those who figure out what they love from a very young age and work towards it all their life. Some just have it handed to them. But for others, it takes a significant amount of time and thoughtful consideration just to determine what they want to do and what careers are remotely interesting. That is still my case. Though I may have finally found my calling, Im uncertain of what I want to do with it; my mind jumps back and forth between the possibilities. Figuring it out is a process, one that I figure will last well into my adulthood.

           The amount of work and experience it takes to get to where you want to be can be a little unsettling once it hits you and when youre young and eager, its very easy to bite off more than you can chew. The very thought of having to wait until I finally get to where I want to be can be extremely frustrating at timesespecially when I have the utmost confidence in my abilities. But like I said, not many of us can jump into exactly what they want. It takes a little time and patience to get there.

           As Ive mentioned, I currently work as a technical writer for a financial technology company, documenting software and producing help files for our clients. Not exactly the most exciting subject, but interesting nonetheless, and much closer to my goal of breaking into the internet industry. Previously, I worked as a technical writer for a theme park, covering the mechanical manuals used to maintenance the rides and attractionssemi-interesting, but not my preferred line of work either. I stuck that one out for about a year and a half.

           Dabble in everything that may be of interest, narrow them down to a core few, and determine your niche. Use that niche to your advantage, but dont limit yourself. You have probable cause to experience everything you think you would enjoy doing. Take every opportunity youre given and use them as stepping-stones to something greater. Get the experience and move on. Never stay in one spot too long until you feel like thats where youre meant to be. And once you get bored, just re-evaluate. Its never too late to learn something new. The least it can do is make you a well-rounded professional.

           With this philosophy in mind, I accepted these jobs knowing that they werent exactly what I was looking for, but that they were great opportunities to get the experience I need to move further up the ladder. Theyre also the same opportunities that have caused me to reevaluate my current career choice, but, more on that later.

           Declaring My Goals

          <p class="graf--p" id="ec13" name="ec13">
           I think now is as good a time as any to discuss and layout my goals (because up until now, Ive never actually written them out). I have a lot of goals that come to mind in the grand scheme of things, but to keep it concise, I generalized and broke them up into three types of goals:
          </p>
          <ul class="postList">
           <li class="graf--li" id="1d99" name="1d99">
            Short-termcreate a reputation for myself as a respectable professional, develop my portfolio for future opportunities, and learn as much as I can about everything that interests me.

            Long-termwork alongside technology with the internet as my medium. I want to work in an industry that Im genuinely interested in, for a company doing revolutionary things, with a modern, startup environment that keeps me engaged.

            Overalllove what I do. I want to be a well-rounded professional who enjoys waking up for work. I never want to be stuck at a dead-end desk job dissatisfied with what I do.

          <p class="graf--p" id="9e59" name="9e59">
           Currently, Im focusing on short-term because its the key to the other two. Once I build a respectable reputation for myself and develop my portfolio, Ill be able to take advantage of multiple opportunities to work in an ideal environment, at a company that Im excited to be a part of, and potentially open doors that lead to my overall goal.

           Initially, my long-term goal was to land a job with Google, or any tech company for that matter; companies like Microsoft, Samsung, Apple (though Im not an Apple fan) or internet-based companies like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Reddit. The list of places goes on. But the more I think about it, I realize that the only type of writing Id really be doing at these companies would be, well, technical writing. And Im not so sure I want to stick with it. Its the one underlying question that haunts me daily.

           Who knows, maybe Ill change my career to UX/UI or web design and join a startup. Maybe Ill stick with writing but go the journalism route, writing for a tech blog or magazine. Maybe Ill go down the road of advertising and write persuasive content for consumers. Perhaps Ill end up starting my own tech-based company or copywriting business, or even writing a few books. These are all possibilities for me, and at this point, its a toss-up.

Its my way of creating an online presenceIll build a respectable audience through these blogs and the various social media platforms Ill be interacting with along the way. From there, Ill build my portfolio through guest blogging and other freelance services, study and learn new things to add to my repertoire (powered by various online channels and my own determination), and continue to work my way up in experience until I finally get to a place where I dont mind waking up in the morning. And if that feeling ever wears off, Ill move to the next thing. This is all ideal of course. It sounds so clean and polished when written out, but I really have no idea whats in store for me, or how itll all play out.

I have many thoughts, ideas, and inspirations throughout the day, and considering that I work a full-time job as a technical writer while trying to keep a social life, its very difficult to keep track of everything that runs through my mind. This is an attempt to add a bit of organization to the chaos, as well as an opportunity to give others an inside look at what goes through my mind as a young professional.
