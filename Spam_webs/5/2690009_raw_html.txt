          Emission regulations established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) required BMW to sell vehicles with new emission standards in California, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont. In order to comply with these regulations, starting MY03 BMW sold Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (SULEV) in these four states.
          <ul>
           <li>
            BMW offered three SULEV models in the states mentioned above: 325i sedan, sport wagon and coupe (equipped with automatic transmission). There were no AWD SULEV models. For ordering purposes in the four states mentioned, these three SULEV vehicles had their own model designations.
           </li>
           <li>
            The difference between SULEV and non-SULEV vehicles extended beyond the emissions rating.  Arguably the most important was the warranty:  an extensive emissions warranty covers far more.  It lasts 15-years and 150,000-miles with no deductible.  Some of the differences are obvious (the engine looks different), others not so much: the fuel tank is metal instead of plastic (for evaporative emissions purposes).  Originally, only automatic transmission 325 models could be SULEV vehicles, but this changed with the E90 model transition where either transmission could be a SULEV.)

            E46 SMG models were remarkably rough-shifting and problematic.  They sold poorly as a result.  Very few were ordered and this option was later dropped.  While the SMG system used on the 325 was not the same system as used on the M3, both have poor reputations.  For full details see the various long-term tests of these drive train combinations in Car and Driver, Automobile, and other enthusiast magazines.)

           Adaptive Xenons not only auto-level as the standard Xenons do, but they also rotate side-to-side depending on orientation of the steering wheel. The goal is to point the light in the direction the car is traveling. A complex algorithm uses car speed, wheel angle, etc. to determine where to point the lights. Of interesting note is the fact that when the car is not moving, the lights will not turn to the driver's side (this is to avoid potential blinding of oncoming traffic, e.g. at a stop light). The headlight switch must be in the "A" (automatic) position -- turning the headlight switch to the "On" position will auto-level the headlights and turn them on, but they will be fixed straight ahead and not turn left and right.

           The change was made about halfway through the 2005 model year and driven primarily by the inability of the alcantara wheel to hold up well over time.

Many originally-alcantara Performance Package 330s, however, will have had the alcantara wheel swapped out for leather under warranty due to excessive wear of the alcantara.

         How durable or reliable is the E46? Is it expensive to own?
        </span>
       </h3>
       <p>
        Given that the average E46 is 7+ years old, this is a particularly common concern for prospective buyers.
       </p>
       <p>
        To begin with, "reliability" means different things to different people. To some, a car that starts and runs and doesn't break down
        <i>
         frequently
        </i>
        would be considered reliable. To others, a "reliable" car is one that runs forever with little or no maintenance. The E46 is of the former--the engines and most of the drivetrain components are first class, though unfortunately there are also peripheral components of questionable design and/or production quality which are likely to fail. If you want or expect a car that will get you where you need to go (provided it is properly maintained), an E46 will do that. If you want a car that you can abuse or neglect, or one that will be absolutely free of any sort of minor nuisance or defect, look elsewhere.  That being said, unlike some other BMW's models, the E46 does
        <b>
         not
        </b>
        have particularly problematic electronics; "gremlins" are unusual. Virtually all of the model's common problems are now well documented, and most are actually fairly easy to diagnose and repair.
       </p>
       <p>
        The following E46/BMW components can be considered highly dependable (Least likely to cause issues):
       </p>
       <div style="border-left: 0.2em solid #3CABB2; margin-left: 0.5em; padding-left: 0.5em;">

        The following components are reasonably dependable but do occasionally suffer from minor or seemingly unusual issues (which are generally cheap and/or easy to resolve):

          Rear subframe, primarily (but not absolutely limited to) the early model year cars (model years 1999-2000--i.e. ALL 323/328 sedan/coupes). Convertibles and Wagons of all years have least reports of failure. For all models, it is important to verify subframe and differential bushings are in good shape so there is minimal play in heavy drivetrain components which could further stress the subframe mounting area.

        Cost of upkeep varies wildly. The E46 is not an exotic car per se, and does not generally require any special service techniques beyond any other typical import car, though dealerships and many third party shops will attempt to bill you as though it is. Without question, you will save a significant sum of money by performing your own simple repairs and routine maintenance; meanwhile, paying dealership/shop prices for window regulator repairs and blower resistor pack replacements will make it difficult to justify the cost of ownership.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bottom line, budget about $1000 per year for repairs and maintenance (including tires, brakes, oil, etc) if you perform the maintenance yourself. If you intend to have a third party perform all work, you might realistically expect to spend 2-3x this amount.
       </p>
       <h4>

         What should I look out for?
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The E46 doesn't have many significant problem areas and is generally a durable vehicle; however if the car was not maintained at by the PO, you can expect numerous problems just like any used and abused car. If you are going to buy a used E46, avoid cars without a good maintenance and repair history. Luckily, the E46 had free maintenance until 36,000 or 50,000 miles (depending on year), so most early maintenance was performed by BMW dealers. Any dealer should be able to provide the service history with just the last seven digits of the VIN.

        Below are some typically and well known issues:

       <ul>
        <li>
         <b>
          Window regulators
         </b>
         - The windows will then either make clicking noises as they go up/down (sign of a failing regulator) or not operate at all possibly leaving your window partially or fully open. This is an extremely common failure and a clear weakspot on the E46 Sedans.  Out of warranty, expect to pay $700+ per door for parts and labor. Some owners had success asking BMW NA to cover all or a portion of the cost for this design defect even when the vehicle was out of warranty.

         </b>
         - The updated E46 sedan (from 9/01 to 3/05 production) wiring harness has a design defect with grounding wires for the rear lighting that are too small and are made of poor quality materials, thus leading to wiring harness failure due to overheating. As stated in BMW's TSB, "Customers may complain that one of the rear lights is inoperative. CAUSE:  Minor corrosion at the 8-pin rear lamp connector creates high resistance causing damage to the connector housing. CORRECTION: Repair the damaged wire(s) and replace damaged connector housing. Install additional ground wires to both left and right rear lamps."  This can be easily confirmed by careful examination of the rear lamp wiring connectors which are usually melted. Symptoms include a "burned out bulb" warning in the instrument panel and (intermittently) completely inoperative rear lamp cluster(s). While BMW has a TSB for this problem, many have occurred out of warranty leading to arguments with the dealer (automotive lighting standards are Federally legislated, yet BMW refuses to repair this design defect once the cars are out of warranty).  BMW dealers expect $350-$400, or more, PER SIDE to make the tail lamps work.  As a result, check for a NHTSA recall (or a class-action lawsuit against BMW) before you pay for repairs.  There are many threads on this problem; see the BMW TIS (search for SIB 63 03 06 if the attached link is inop)

          Cooling system
         </b>
         - The cooling system will eventually fail catastrophically due to a disintegrating water pump bearing. When this occurs all coolant is lost within seconds and the engine will overheat instantly (remember, these cars have only a total of ~2 gallons of coolant). A much better water pump than the stock/OEM unit is available from EMP Steward, but it's pricey ($200) compared to stock ($70). Other items on the cooling system that should be considered maintenance items since they will likely/eventually fail are the plastic/electric thermostat and the coolant reservoir. Therefore, preventative cooling system maintenance replacing these items every 60k to 80k miles is strongly advised.  If an engine is allowed to seriously overheat the repair costs can reach several thousand dollars because of warped cylinder heads.  There is an excellent write-up on the cooling system and components posted as a sticky on E46fanatics.com written by Mango.

          VANOS
         </b>
         - Unit wear and failure. This was already the case with the B52 engines in the E36, but it's much easier to repair on the E46's B54 engines since the timing chains do not have to be removed. This defect is mostly related to the Buna o-rings in the unit's control pistons which due to heat induced hardening allow excessive oil bypass, thus leading to less accurate control of camshaft timing. Fluctuating idle or stalling can also be signs of this problem. Depending on maintenance this can already occur at 50K miles. If this defect occurs, there is a noticeable rattle in the engine from the VANOS unit, often around 2,000 rpm and low rpm performance will be affected. Repair is actually relatively easy and a true DIY for someone who has basic skills. Replacing the Buna o-rings with higher quality Viton rings in the VANOS unit will fix the issue. Better yet

         sells the above mentioned Viton seal/o-ring DIY kits. Cam sensors (intake and exhaust) on the VANOS unit are also prone to fail and as small as they are, they are expensive ($100+). The exhaust sensor is usually the first to fail and that occurs often right around 100K miles. It has been proven that ONLY OEM BMW sensors should be installed during repair since all aftermarket units are not that compatible and of lower quality. VANOS units on ZHP cars are especially failure prone for undetermined reasons. Common opinion is that this is related to the more aggressive camshaft profiles.

          Subframe
         </b>
         - There are many reports of cracked or torn subframe mounting points. Most often the two rear mounting points below the trunk floor are affected. This occurs more often (but not exclusive to) on the early E46 323/328 models. BMW later improved the subframe mounting points in the trunk floor of the car and in later E46 325i/330i this problem seems to be less common. This problem seems to be so frequent in early E46 cars that a check before buying a 323i/328i IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST! Repairs are very expensive and difficult since the rear axle and subfram have to be removed and the unibody frame and mounting points have to be welded. Recurring stress cracking often occurs even after a repair has been made. You can find more information as well as what it looks like in these threads:

         - Many E46 models have erratic HVAC fan speed condition wherein the instrument panel display indicates a set constant fan speed, yet the fan changes speed on a 1hz rate (constantly up and down), or fails to come on at all.  This is almost always results from failure of defective original Final Stage Resistors (FSR) whose design provided insufficient heat sink surface area.  The improved design FSR's can be purchased for ~$60 to $80 from a wide variety of vendors; installation threads abound.

        , BMW includes more options as standard with the "up level" model (such as power seats, HK premium sound in later years, trip computer, etc.).  Furthermore, there would likely be a premium back when you sell or trade it in. In covertible version the differences are even more pronounced since the convertible is a much heavier car and the substantially higher torque of the 328/330 engines are very helpful. Fuel economy is surprisingly identical between the engines since the smaller engines have to be pushed harder in traffic what the larger engines accomplish with more ease. Test drive a car in your price range and see if it meets your needs.

        First of all, you should recognize the difference between maintenance and warranty.  BMW offered 36,000 mi/3yr or 50,000 mi/4yr free maintenance (depending on year).  This maintenance covered oil changes, brakes, and windshield wipers (it may also cover items like coolant or brake fluid flush depending on timing).   BMW also offered a 50,000 mi/4yr bumper to bumper warranty, which covers any problems you may have.

There are deals out there where dealers are offering the maintenance extension for as low as $950.   A single 4-wheel brake job can cost about that much if performed by a dealer.  Additionally, worn clutch replacements are included within the extended maintenance plan.

Take the $2000 that an extended warranty would typically cost you and stick it into an interest bearing account.   Find a good independent BMW mechanic and pay for any repairs that come up out of that account.    I can almost guarantee that at the end of the "would be" warranty period, you'll have money in that account left over!

          How much does the extended warranty cost? Is the price negotiable?
         </b>
         "Service contracts" vary in price according to length and level of coverage, as well as by "deductible." Most definitely, the price is negotiable. The cost of the service contract is also dependent on who the provider is, and how likely they are to be in business in a few years. NOTE:  These policies are either "Named Component" or "Named Exclusion" programs.  The difference is that the latter is far better.  In a Named Component program, ONLY the items listed in your contract are covered.  In a Named Exclusion program everything is covered, except for the specific items listed in your contract.  One of the major ways these programs can deny coverage is when an esoteric component fails, and it is not listed in a Named Component program.  Hence, if you feel you must buy one of these contracts (which have very large markups), then get a Named Exclusion policy.

          Can I buy the policy through any dealer or only from the dealer that I bought the car from?
         </b>
         Most service contracts can be purchased from any dealer. Some dealerships are signed up with specific warranty providers that will not permit a warranty to be placed on a vehicle that was not serviced and sold through the dealership.

        <p>
         <b>
          Can I get repairs done at any dealer in the country?
         </b>
         Generally speaking, the repair doesn't even have to be performed by a "dealer" per se... The only requirement (in most cases) is that the repair is performed by a reputable licensed repair facility... As a general rule, "deductibles" are usually lower, or are waived if the repair is performed by the selling dealer.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Is the policy underwritten by a 3rd party or BMW?
         </b>
         Unfortunately, service contracts for BMW's are only (at this time) administered by a 3rd party...:-(
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          What happens if this third party company goes bankrupt, does the dealership take over the policy?
         </b>
         Unfortunately, no... If the company goes bankrupt, you will probably lose your money... This has happened before. Make sure that you select a solid one.
As long as you purchase a warranty from an insured provider you will be fine. There are many to choose from and they are affordable.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          How long do you have after buying the car to decide on buying the extended warranty?
         </b>
         You have up until there is a minmum of 1 month, *and* 1,000 miles remaining on the original factory warranty...
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Is the only variable between buying the policy now instead of at the end of the allowable period the possibility that the price of the policy might go up? If so, how much have prices been going up recently.
         </b>
         The advantage of getting one early is obviously financial... If you buy one with the car, the cost can be included (i.e. financed) right in with the rest of the deal, and included in your monthly payments. There is also the issue of an "eligibility surcharge" that gets applied at various levels or intervals... Lastly, they do go up in price regularly... The last price increase I saw was on the order of several hundred dollars... Because service contracts are "transferable", and build "future value" it may make sense for some buyers to get one. If you are going to get one, the sooner the better... One thing is a given fact: they will go up in price... Think of them as a hedge against inflation. "Lock-in" future repairs at today's costs...

        BMW of North America offers specific option packages.  Elsewhere in the world, a program called BMW Individual is offered to allow individuals to better mix and match options.  Options and packages often have numerical or alphanumerical codes associated with them.  These codes are used as shorthand to describe the option or package on many BMW forums around the internet.

        <span class="mw-headline" id="ZHP_-_Performance_Package">
         ZHP - Performance Package
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The performance package was available on 2003-2005 330 sedans (330i) and 2004-2006 330 coupes and convertibles (330Ci/330Cic). In 2003, it was only available with the 6-speed manual transmission and WITHOUT the premium package. In 2004, all performance package cars were also available with the automatic (steptronic) transmission as well as the premium package.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously, the Performance Package is an inclusive optional package incorporating all of the features of the Sport Package, so they're not available together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Original Press release:  The 330i Performance Package has been created exclusively for the U.S. market for enthusiasts by enthusiasts at BMW Individual, a division of BMW M GmbH. There is no aspect of the driving experience that has not been enhanced by the Performance Package. Modifications to the 3.0-liter in-line six-cylinder engine, which include different camshafts and performance-modified Digital Motor Electronics, yield a ten horsepower increase to 235. For the first time in a 330i a six-speed manual transmission will be standard. With the Performance Package it will include a short-throw shifter. The package also includes a shorter final drive ratio. The benefits of these modifications are immediately apparent - the 330i with a Performance Package will accelerate from 0 - 60 miles-per-hour in 6 seconds, about half a second faster than a standard 330i. To match the straight-line performance a new sports suspension, more aggressively tuned than the 330i's standard sport suspension, is mated to 18-inch wheels with mixed-size performance tires. In addition to the wheels and tires the exterior of the 330i Performance Package is distinguished by its Aerodynamic Package, black headlight trim, high gloss shadowline trim and a new exhaust that not only appears but also sounds more aggressive. The look and feel of the interior has been refined with cloth and Alcantara sport seats matching the Alcantara sport steering wheel. An anthracite headliner and Black cube aluminum trim complete an ambiance tailored to the enthusiast. Silver cube aluminum trim is optional. The instrumentation includes red needles while the tachometer reflects the modified engine's 300 higher rpm limit. Production of the 330i Performance Package will begin in March 2003 with the first cars arriving at BMW centers in April.

        Per the BMW press release, this package included the following changes. However, many of these claims have been found to be misleading:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Engine mods that equal a gain of 10HP &amp; 8 ft/lb of torque by reprogramming the Digital Motor Electronics to allow a 6800 RPM max (up from 6500).
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         6 speed short throw shifter (for manual transmission equipped cars)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         3.07:1 Final drive ratio w/ manual trans instead of the standard 2.91:1. Convertibles retained the already installed 3.07 ratio.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Max Speed Limiter set to 155 mph (instead of 128)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         New M suspension, more "sporty" than standard or poor road package.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        There are no "ZHP" specific springs. The same springs are used for comparably equipped 330's for both the ZSP and the ZHP. In both cases, 
the spring rate for the post 4/01 build ZSP and ZHP is believed to be slightly less than that of the pre-4/01 ZSP
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Firmer shocks (Jounce: front +50%, rear +20%), (Rebound: front +35%, rear -8%)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        ZHP does use different dampers than the ZSP. There is a shortage of shock dyno data, but based on the SACHS damping parameter values it is believe 
the jounce damping is the same but rebound damping is stiffer on the ZHP. Pre-4/01 sport package cars had similar damping values to the ZHP but 
used the higher grade SACHS "Advantage" dampers rather than the "Super Touring" model.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Smaller diameter anti-roll bars: 23.5 mm front (v. 24mm pre-04/01 ZSP), 18mm rear (v. 19mm pre-04/01 ZSP)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        There is no 18.5 mm rear sway bar offered by BMW for the E46.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         More rigid forward bushings
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Front Control arm bushings are the same ZHP/ZSP
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         ZHP control arms are different and use a stiffer ball joint
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Lower ride height by 15 mm (.6 inches) utilizing shorter auxiliary springs
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Since both the ZSP and ZHP use the same springs, they have the same ride height. Both are 15mm lower than a non-sport E46 
-.5 degrees of camber (for a total of -1.1 degrees)
Alignment settings are the same ZSP and ZHP
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Exterior trim elements (front &amp; rear fascia, trunk lid spoiler)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>

         Shadowline (black gloss) trim

         Large diameter stainless steel dual exhaust outlets

         Extra thick Alcantara steering wheel (later switched to perforated leather)

         Alcantara &amp; cloth upholstery to replace leatherette and standard trim (leather still optional)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Choice of "Black Cube" or "Silver Cube" interior trim
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Red needles on the instrument cluster

       <ul>
        <li>
         Style 135's are added, 18x8.0" front, 18x8.5" rear
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Wider Tires: 225/40ZR-18 in front and 255/35ZR-18 in the rear.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Reduced steering rack ratio. 13.7:1 versus 15.5:1
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        All post 4/01 330's use the same ratio steering rack. The ratio of this rack is 13.7:1, it is believed to be different from that used on the 325's

        You should not have the 20-pin DLC connector. You only need to HOLD the left odometer reset button WHILE turning the key to position 1 (Accessory). Keep holding the button for 5 or so seconds until any of the following shows in the display: OIL SERVICE or INSPECTION with RESET or RE. Release the button and press it again for another 5 or so seconds until RESET or RE flash. While the display flashes, press the button one more time briefly. If done correctly, END SIA should show up for a few seconds. All done.

        Havoline's corporate product data sheet cites Havoline Multi-Vehicle ATF as a suitable replacement fill for both ETL 8072-B and ETL 7045-E (used on the ZF trans).   A local Havoline distributor will drop ship a box of 12 ea. one (1) quart bottles for about $50.  gordo325xiwagon Aug07

        Some feel modern coolants are most likely the same in composition, and pre-mixed 50/50 brands that are sold locally are very good coolants. Some of the most important characteristics of a good coolant are its pH, boiling point, and freezing point. The common coolants perform very well in those three areas.

        It is strongly recommended to ONLY use the OEM specified NGK plugs for replacements. Bosch Platinum 4 plugs are also available for the M54 engine but will often not perform, cause misfires and set CEL light and codes. Better stick with the NGKs even though they are more expensive.

        While BMW considers the fuel filter to be a "lifetime" part which never requires replacement, replacement is relatively cheap insurance against premature fuel pump failure.  One US member reported that his filter was nearly clogged at 60k miles (as suggested by an inability to blow through the old filter).  In contrast, the new filter had no resistance (akin to blowing through a straw).  Look at the fuel color and contents of Solidjake's 88,000 mile old fuel filter after replacement

        Best to have a near-empty tank of gas if you can before you pull the pump to minimize fuel spillage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pumps usually last 6-12 years and can fail due to time as much as miles.  Many replace preventively at 10 years or before 150k miles.  Running gas of questionable quality and running below 1/4 tank frequently may shorten the life of the pump due to increased contaminants and lack of fuel quantity needed to keep the pump running cool.

        If the main drive belt ("serpentine belt") is making noise, it may be worn, but most likely one of your idler or tensioner pulleys has worn out and is squawking as it turns.  It tends to be most noticeable on cold starts in the winter.  See the Cooling section below regarding diagnostic/replacement of these pulleys.  Cracks- a serpentine belt with a few cracks here and there is ok, but when you see more than a few in a 1-2" section, it's ready to be replaced.

From 6/99 production to 4/00 production, these parts are known to fail under high cornering and torque situations - unfortunately that means you may lose all power while going around a corner at high speed.  This sudden forward weight transfer can result in loss of control of the vehicle.   BMW has discontinued the replacement part - the only replacement option is to upgrade to the 330i transmission output shaft at a cost of $600+.

        The LF-20 pumps are known to shear the pulley shaft, leaving a pump that looks normal with spinning pulley and no leaks but no power steering.  To diagnose, draw some fluid out of the reservoir and start the car.  Check to see if fluid is moving.  A more definitive check can be done by loosening the serpentine belt and pulling the PS pump pulley towards the front of the car. It shouldn't move more than a hair and should feel some resistance to spinning.  Careful - pull it out too far and the all the fluid will leak out.  A broken shaft will allow the pulley to spin freely and pull out.  A full drain of the system at the steering rack is recommended to get out any metal shavings from the failed pump.  Newer LF-30 pumps require a different hose as well when replacing.

        If your CCV/CVV (Crankcase Ventilation Valve, aka the oil separator valve) is clogged, you might notice an odd "foghorn" or "whistling" sound at engine shutdown (whoosh sound is normal), and typically increased consumption of oil since it can leak and pass oil into the combustion chambers. It is also possible, though apparently not common, that the exhaust will have a lot of blue or gray smoke. (white smoke indicates burning coolant).  Other symptoms include rough running, loss of power, and spark plugs wet with oil.

        If you are getting the very common fuel control mixture lean or running lean codes from an ODB II code reader the usual but not exclusive source of problems can be either the idle control valve (ICV), DISA valve (also known as the Intake Manifold Resonance Valve), lower intake boot, Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor or a combination of all of those.  These are relatively easy DIY's and can all be done together for a low cost.  The fuel filter should also be considered in researching these issues.

        A common source of an oil leak is located at the Oil Filter Housing Gasket.  This is not the rubber ring that you replace when you do an oil change.  It is a gasket at the base of the oil filter housing where it attaches to the engine.  Some members have reported this as a problem due to using a wrench instead of a 36mm socket when changing the oil filter.  A tell tale sign is oil leaking on the right side of the engine block (if facing the engine from the front of the car -- driver's side).  AlboBMW has provided this excellent DIY

        All US E46 cars are pre-wired for the BMW alarm, but no US cars come with the alarm standard.  The alarm consists of three pieces; The siren, which bolts to the firewall on the engine side (behind the cabin microfilter housing), the motion sensor, which is placed behind the square panel in the center of the headliner, and the tilt/tow sensor, which is bolted to the right side of the inside of the trunk area, above the battery.

        .  If you install it yourself, a dealer OR independent mechanic with the appropriate autologic/GT1/Modic3 computer will still need to code the car for the alarm - most charge ~$50 or so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't know if you have the alarm?  Pop the square panel in the center of your headliner down (you can pull it with your fingernails - just held up with clips) and see if you find a motion sensor.  You can also lock the car with the windows down, leave the area for 60 seconds, then wave your hand in the car to see if it goes off.
       </p>
       <p>
        A dealer, independent mechanic, or anyone with proper coding software such as PA Soft CAN set the car so that the parking lights blink when the car is locked/unlocked without the alarm being installed.

        Sirius is available for nav-equipped cars built 9/03 or later, but XM Direct does not work with navigation at this time (they're still working on it).

       <p>
        Owners of older non-nav (pre 09/02) cars may circumvent these restrictions by replacing the head unit with the newer model. Those with older nav-equipped (pre 09/03) cars would have to replace their old radio (in the trunk) with the newer BM53 unit and upgrade their nav to the newer system (probably not worth it from a cost perspective).

        Although the Sirius kit is not officially available for the 3er Touring due to a lack of an approved mounting location, there is no reason that it wouldn't work if wired just like any of the other 3er models (you'll just have to find an alternative method of securing the unit in the rear trunk area).

       <p>
        The OEM Bluetooth (BT) kit is available for e46's made 3/02 or later. It is compatible with all other BMW options (including the Navigation system) except Assist (on pre-9/04 cars). Starting with 9/04 production (2005 model year), BT came factory installed on cars equipped with Assist (using the same module).
       </p>
       <p>
        BT on pre-9/04 is very rare, as it would have to be retrofitted by the owner, and is expensive, so don't assume your car has it.  Cars came from the factory with a card indicating a BT passcode, even though pre-9/04 cars does not have a BT module.  The telephone button on the steering wheel also does not indicate whether a car has BT or not, but merely that the car is pre-wired for a telephone, as indicated by the sticker on the truck lid. On pre-9/04 cars, there will be a separate pairing button (located under the armrest - see install link) on BT-retrofitted cars.  On post-9/04 cars, there is no pairing button, and the pairing procedure is slightly different that older models.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you have the Assist, but would prefer the BT, you can have the BT. It's merely a matter of removing Assist (the BT requires the same harness that the Assist uses). The module is fairly expensive (over $500), and the best sources seem not to be dealers.  Many dealers refused to sell to cars equipped with Assist (this may have changed by now, but was the case when the cars were new).   Also, most dealers would not install it, as the module swap disabled Assist, so it's strictly DIY.  It is a very simple procedure for even the non-mechanically minded, though.  Check with Bimmernav

       <p>
        Lastly, there are different generations of the BMW Bluetooth kit, so check your vehicle's month of manufacture too, as phone compatibility varies over the years. If retrofitting the Bluetooth module, obtain the most recent model possible.

        The BMW-supplied iPod adapter is only available for MY 2002 or later. For MY 2002 e46's, the iPod adapter is not compatible with the tape player headunit. It is also not compatible with the satelite radio or the cd changer for any model year. The iPod adapter can not be used with the Nav system (see aftermarket solutions).  If you currently have a CD changer, but would prefer the iPod adapter, you can do so by removing the CD changer.

       </h3>
       <p>
        The DICE is compatible with the Business or Professional RDS/MD/CD headunits. It is compatible with nav, but not the CD changer. The DICE is also compatible with Sirius.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DICE unit plugs into the cd changer plug in the trunk. Your car then thinks it has a cd changer installed - you press the MODE button on your NAV to select CDC (cd changer) *or* you press the CD button on your non-Nav radio to select CDC (cd changer mode) once the DICE is plugged in.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can then use your up &amp; down buttons on your steering wheel to select previous/next track on the iPod.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DICE will charge your iPod.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you put your car in CDC mode, the iPod is powered up automatically and begins playing from the point at which you last shut it off. When you turn the car off or put the radio in FM/AM/CD/Aux mode, the iPod automatically shuts down.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DICE will also display artist/title/track information on the radio or NAV screen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Installation is fairly straightforward, involving running the cable from the trunk-mounted icelink control box that plugs into your cd changer wires to wherever you want the iPod. Dension sells Proclip dash-board mounts directly on their site. See a picture of KrisL's ipod in the DICE with the proclip dash-board mount

        In late 2002, the Business CD head was revised to accept an aux in plug at the rear of the unit.  Basically, if you have the little black badge inside your trunk lid that says pre-wired for Sattelite radio, this kit should work for you.

       <p>
        You can purchase an auxilary input cable from dealers that provides a generic stereo audio input into the BMW sound system (without the ability to view track information, or control the source device).  This is a simple DIY retrofit, but some people may struggle if the vehicle has Nav installed.  Electronically-minded people will probably be able to make the cable themselves, as it is no more complicated than two plugs and a resistor.

        First, don't be driving while doing this procedure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turn the radio off then on again. Don't touch any button except the 'm' button - the button you use to tune the radio frequency manually. Press and hold the 'm' button for TEN seconds or until the display changes. IIRC, it shows the serial number of the unit. Normally when you press 'm', the display will reflect that by replacing 'ST' (stereo tuning) with 'm'. When holding the 'm' button for this procedure, the display should not do this - you will continue to see 'ST' for the ten seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now if the display has changed, you are in a configure mode on the radio. If you press the '+' or '-' button you change modes. The mode you want will display as "GAL (1-6)". This mode allows you to adjust the speed-sensitive volume control. Use the radio preset buttons 1-6 to set the amount of volume change you want at speed. Setting 1 is the smallest change, 6 is the highest.
       </p>
       <p>
        I use 1 with the windows closed, and 4 when it's a nice day and I drive with the windows open which makes for a lot of ambient noise at speed. The car is so quiet with the windows closed that setting 1 is plenty. On my car the default setting from the factory was 3 and it bugged me too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then turn the radio OFF to save the settings. Turn it back on and go for a drive to test it. The other semi-useful test mode will tell you the signal strength of any given station from 0 to 15 (highest). Use the preset buttons to change stations in the mode. This capability is probably used in the automatic tuning functions in the radio.

         E46 Sound System Explained
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The sound system in your E46 is unique in that it consists of a control unit up front, an amplifier in the trunk, and 10 individual speakers inside the cabin. For those cars with the Business Radio, the front dash mounted "head unit" consists of a radio and a CD or cassette tape player. There is no amplification in the dash mounted unit. For non-US model cars, there are other stereos used, some of which have a traditional head unit that includes the amplification.
       </p>
       <p>
        If your vehicle is equipped with the BMW Navigation system it is configured similarly except that the radio/tuner is an additional, separate module in the trunk. The amp, radio, and nav computer are all located behind the trim panel inside the left side of the trunk.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The Speakers
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The speaker setup in the E46 consists of a 3-way component system up front (2-way for non-H/K coupes) and a 2-way component system in the rear. A component system consists of separate speakers located in key locations within the car's interior.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each front door has three speakers: a mid-bass driver low in the door panel, a midrange, and a tweeter. In H/K coupes the midrange and tweeter are located next to each other behind the cloth grille next to the chrome door handle, non-H/K couples lose the midrange. In the sedan the midrange is mid-door panel and the tweeter is behind the side view mirror near the a-pillar. For those of you who can count, that's six speakers shared between the two front doors to handle the front stereo image.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the rear, both models have a pair of mid-bass drivers in the rear deck. The coupes have a tweeter mounted in the rear side panel just above the rear seat arm rest, the sedans have them in the rear doors. That's four more speakers to handle the rear stereo image.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those cars equipped with the H/K upgrade have two additional speakers under the rear deck. The coupe has an oval shaped assembly in the center of the rear deck that houses two 6x9" subwoofer drivers. The sedan has two separate drivers under the mid-bass locations on the outside corners. Each configuration has a separate amplifier to power the subs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The Amplification
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of the 10 speakers in the car are designed to handle a specific range of frequencies. The mid-bass drivers handle low end or bass, the midrange handles vocals and middle range frequencies, and the tweeters handle the high frequencies. The head unit provides the full range of frequencies to the amplifier as a pre-amplified signal. The amplifier splits these frequencies, amplifies them, and sends them to each of the 10 individual speakers inside of the car. The coupe amplifier splits these frequencies differently than the sedan amplifier does because the equalization is customized for each interior specifically. Why? Because the acoustics inside the coupe are different than the acoustics inside the sedan.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you can see, this system configuration is different than what most of us understand a traditional autosound system to be. In a traditional system, there are four channels (front left, front right, rear left, rear right) amplified and sent to four "speakers" within the car. In traditional systems, those speakers may consist of a 2-way or 3-way setup with a self contained crossover that splits the full-range amplifed signal amongst the two or three drivers.
       </p>
       <p>
        HK amplifier receives balanced differential signal from a head-unit using two pairs of Signal+ and Signal-(not ground) wires. The voltage level is 12V P-P. It is possible to send unbalanced signal (found in consumer devices) to amplifier by connecting positive side of source to positive signal. In this case, negative signal wires must be grounded to avoid noise and distortion. Otherwise a line converter may be used to convert unbalanced signal.

         Upgrades Retaining The Factory Head Unit
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        For security and aesthetic reasons, retaining the factory head unit is the route most people decide on. This is possible because of the separate amplification that the factory system uses. It is this separate amplification that also poses some challenges with speaker upgrades.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Good - Speakers Only
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The basic upgrade consists of speaker replacement only. You retain your factory head unit and amplifier. Because your car has component speakers from the factory, you will need to replace them with component speakers. One vendor, Bavarian Soundworks, has a plug-n-play solution that they have designed to work with the factory amplifier and to fit in the factory locations. Installation is just a remove and replace operation. Those who have done this upgrade say it is an improvement over the stock speakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can you use other brands speakers to do the basic upgrade? You can, however, there are some things to remember. An aftermarket component speaker "system" consists of the speakers and an external crossover. The external crossover is a box full of electronics that connects to a single amplifier channel, and the two (or three) individual speakers connect to the crossover. The crossover filters the frequencies to the individual speakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        When retaining the factory amplifier you cannot use the crossovers supplied with your aftermarket speaker system because the factory amp is already filtering the frequencies. There is no single full frequency amplified channel to connect the aftermarket crossover to, get it?
       </p>
       <p>
        Since you cannot use the supplied crossover, your new speakers will likely not sound as good as they did in the store when you listened to them. This is because the factory amplifier is filtering the frequencies based on the ranges that BMW's sound system designers determined to be optimum for the factory supplied speakers installed in the factory locations. When you replace these with different speakers, the filtering may no longer optimum for the new speakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, if you want your new speakers to play as loud as the factory originals, you need to "resistance match" the replacement speaker to the original. This is the tough part because most over-the-counter speakers you can buy are 4 ohms, and the mid-bass/woofers in your stock system are 2 ohm rated. If you plug a 4 ohm speaker in place of a 2 ohm, it won't play as loud and you'll be disappointed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Good II - Add a Sub
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        You may just want to add a subwoofer to the factory system to provide better low end punch. This is a common and easily implemented upgrade that includes a trunk mounted subwoofer powered by a separate amplifier. The best installation method is to split the front pre-amp signal at the amplifier and send that signal to your new amplifier. Why the front channels? Because you want to volume match the sub to your front sound stage as best as possible and normally you'll have the fader set to bias the front speakers. A separate sub volume control is usually a good idea with this upgrade option.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Better - Amp &amp; Speakers
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The next best upgrade replaces the factory amplifier and the speakers. In this author's opinion, these are the weak links in the factory systems. The amps have low quality power, the speakers use flimsy foam surrounds, plastic baskets for non-H/K, small magnets, all very inexpensive and low-budget componentry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the head unit provides four channels of full frequency pre-amplified signals, you can bypass the factory amp and put an aftermarket four channel amp in it's place. Can you retain the factory speakers? Not in this case because with the factory amp out of the equation there is no way to filter the frequencies to the 10 individual speakers inside the car. Your best option is to purchase a new 2-way component system for the front and a coaxial system for the rear, then power these with your external four channel amplifier.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this configuration you'll have a new tweeter and mid-bass driver up front leaving the factory midrange unused. In the rear you'll replace the deck mounted mid-bass driver with your all-in-one coaxial speaker and the rear tweeters will be unused.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you have the H/K upgrade, you can retain your factory subwoofers by splitting the front pre-amp signal and sending it to the H/K sub amplifier. Why the front channels? Becuase you'll likely have the fader set to bias the front and you want the subs to match the volume of the front stereo image as close as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Best - Amp, Speakers, and Subwoofer
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The best upgrade includes the speaker and amp replacement from the better upgrade and adds a trunk mounted, separately amplifed, subwoofer. This can be accomplished by purchasing a 5 channel amp, or a 4 channel plus a separate dedicated subwoofer amplifier. The sky's the limit on how you want to approach the best upgrade. If you surf around the forums you'll see many creative approaches to subwoofer building and install locations. This author has chosen a single 12" sub in a sealed enclosure.

       <p>
        Simply stated, bed-in is the process of depositing an even layer of brake pad material, or transfer layer, on the rubbing surface of the rotor disc.  It's an important procedure to follow after installing new pads and rotors.  Note that some of the ceramic-type "dustless" pads are recommended to bed gradually per the manufacturer (i.e. Akebonos) in lieu of the more aggressive bedding process described below.

        E46s come with very good brakes from the factory.  If you can engage ABS from freeway speeds (hint: you can!) and you do not experience brake fade, then bigger brakes will NOT make you stop better or faster!  All of your braking is done by the tires and ABS modulation at that point.

       </h4>
       <p>
        It's recommended that you replace rotors and pads together for several reasons:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         BMW pads are fairly abrasive and the rotors soft; therefore, a set of rotors usually only lasts about "1.5 pad lengths" before reaching their minimum thickness spec.
        </li>
        <li>
         Rotors are relatively cheap ($60 per for the 330i, less for the 323/325/328) and only take an additional few minutes to replace when replacing the pads
        </li>
        <li>
         You'll get better brake feel throughout the life of the pads when bedding new pads against new rotors
        </li>
       </ul>

       </h4>
       <p>
        Rotors should be replaced once they are at the minimum width. You should test the thickness of your rotors at 6 - 8 spots around the rotor and use the thinnest measurement to determine whether to replace your rotors.

       <p>
        Brake pads and emergency/park brake shoes should be replaced when at or close to minimum thickness. This is the measure of how much braking material remains on top of the metal backing plate at the thinnest. If the wear of the pads is not uniform thorought the with of each pad and for all pads in the same axle, the cause should be investigated and corrected. For example, sticking calipers, bent holders, rusted pistons, etc. Due to braking dynamics, the front axle brakes wear faster than the rears, usually to a degree of 2 to 1 or more. Brake pads should all be replaced together on the same axle.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thickness of the e-brake shoes located in the integrated drum on the rear axle rotors should be measured at several spots; it is mot unusual for uneven wear. If the surface of the shoe is excessively glazed, braking power will be significantly diminished and the shoes should be replaced.

        If your brake calipers are leaking brake fluid, or the dust boots are damaged, or the piston does not retract easily when changing the pads, or the pads are wearing unevenly, you can consider replacing the seals inside. This is also known as rebuilding the calipers and can be significantly less expensive than replacing them. Sean750 has an

        Overheating in these cars can be the kiss of death.   Anything more than the most minor overheat incident can result in expensive damage to the engine.  If your temp gauge ever ventures north of straight-up, 12 o'clock normal position, pull over immediately and run your heat to bleed off excess heat from the coolant and shut off the engine.  It is not advisable to drive the car at this point as you have likely had a cooling system component failure that must be fixed before running again.

        .  Sometimes stubborn air bubbles need to be "flushed out" by performing the proper bleed procedure just mentioned but with the car running and raising the rpms a bit to get the coolant circulating.  Only to be done if proper cold bleed doesn't get all the air out for whatever reason.

        The ECU purposely makes the speedo read a little high.  You can determine your actual speed and see how much error there is by resetting your average speed on the OBC while cruse control is activated.

        Want to correct the error?  You can feed a signal into the speed sensor and then move the speedo needle.

         There are a number of "secret" OBC functions which can be enabled to display raw data output on the digital odometer. Some are found during standard operation (e.g. average fuel economy), but many others are unique to the "hidden" mode (e.g. engine speed or vehicle speed).
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Note: these functions will work on ALL US-spec E46 cars, even early 323/325 models which are technically not equipped with the OBC option. The OBC is in fact installed and operative in every E46; as an option, it can be "retrofitted" (activated) by installing the OBC-style turn signal stalk and activating the appropriate trigger during an ECU reflash. The better dealership service departments will know how to do this.

       </h4>
       <p>
        First, consider replacing any dark or discolored bulbs with known good bulbs, preferably of the same brand.  (However, this is unlikely to solve the problem for long, if at all.  Here's why:  accessing the bulbs results in moving or josting the wiring.  This can make it seem like you've solved the problem, when the problem actually lies within the wiring connections--it is very likely to return.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, examine your tail lamp wiring connectors for evidence of internal overheating.  See the instructions in BMW S IB (service bulletin) 63 03 06
        <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bmwtis.com/tsb/bulletins/bulletin_graphic_temp/B630306g.htm" rel="nofollow">
         [14]
        </a>
        .  Print this out for your BMW Center if the car is still under any warranty.  The bulletin directs replacement of the melted wiring and connectors, and creates a second, more robust, grounding path for both tail lamp assemblies.  NOTE:  BMW Dealers have been asking $600 to $800+ to repair this known wiring defect.  Defects which prevent automotive lighting from meeting FMVSS 108 are subject to recall for a period of at least ten years, and frequently much longer due to liability issues [see

From the NHTSA web site:  "Safety recall campaigns result from identified component failures which present a risk to highway safety, and from non-compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.  Although a majority of safety recalls are performed by manufacturers without any influence from NHTSA, many result from NHTSA defect investigations and compliance testing."
       </p>
       <p>
        On 8/7/09, NHTSA opened an investigation of tail lamp electrical connection (ground circuit) issues for all MY 2002 - 2005 E46 sedans.  On 12/18/09, NHTSA elevated their investigation to an "engineering analysis" (EA09-019). This investigation is ongoing and NHTSA laboratory investigations of the 'alleged' defect, and a report are expected by June 30, 2010. Interested parties may access the details of this investigation and NHTSA, BMW correspondence by going to NHTSA's web site: "defect investigations."

       <p>
        On 9/04/2011, NHTSA announced a recall of MY 2002 - 2005 325i, 325xi, 330i, 330xi models built between 9/01/2001 and 3/01/2005 to repair the open ground connection at the 8-pin connnector of the tail light assembly. A total of 241,000 vehicles are affected.  The recall identification number is 11V438000.  Repairs will be made free of charge.  Owner notification is expected to begin in October of 2011.  Owner's may Google 'NHTSA Recalls' and enter the appropriate model information to view documents as BMW submits them to NHTSA.

        There are two problems that affect all of your electrical systems.  Symptoms include steering wheel buttons not working, turn signals or gauges not working, radio not turning on, etc.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The most common cause is a failed device on the iBus: try unplugging your cd changer, ipod adapter, satellite radio, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
         The second most common cause is simply a bad battery.  Batteries on the E46 are known to only last about four years.  Using the Hidden Onboard Computer Functions directions above, you can monitor your system voltage.  A healthy battery will show around 12 volts with the car off, and around 14 volts while running.  A cheaper than OEM replacement battery is the "49DL" available from autozone.  Although this battery is of different size and dimension of the OEM battery it can be made to fit and functions properly.  Here's a thread with some details:

         . Many festers have also had luck with an Everstart MAXX 94R or RN found at Walmart, which is the correct original size and dimensions as the OEM battery. You can read the details in this thread:

         Convertibles have a smaller battery tray in the trunk and are unable to use the 49DL and must use the 94R sized battery.

       <p>
        "49DL" and "94R" are standardized battery sizes that will have specific height, width, and length dimensions.  See the threads above for further information.

         If your battery dies and you successfully charge it and restart the car only to find many electrical accessories not working, a    "hard" reset of the system may be necessary.  This involves removing both battery cables and then shorting them together (NOT the terminal posts on the battery!!!) for up to 30 minutes.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>
         If you believe your battery and alternator are good, but the battery keeps dying, you may have what is called a parasitic drain - some electrical component stays on when it's not supposed to and drains the battery when the car's not running.  See this thread for troubleshooting:

        .  Read the first page or two, but be sure to make note of post #177 about battery terminal positions.  Some have had success soldering in a small extension wire where the terminals didn't line up closely with the circuit board connecting points.  In a pinch, a 3v calculator battery can be used temporarily until your rechargeable arrives.

       </h4>
       <p>
        This happens when the car has detected a fault and has disabled the DSC and ABS systems.  If you recently drove on ice, a dynamometer, or on another very slippery surface, the car may just /think/ the system has malfunctioned.  Driving a few miles on a regular surface should fix the problem. Sometimes a dying battery will produce odd errors like this as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another possible fix is to slowly turn the steering wheel from completely left to completely right, then back again.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you did not recently drive on ice and the wheel turning solution did not work, this is usually caused by either:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         One of your wheel speed / ABS sensors failing (there's one on each wheel) or needs cleaning see

        is a post on e46fanatics that describes how to test each wheel speed sensor.   Remove the wheel and identify the wires running from the back of the hub to a disconnectable wiring harness (do not confuse this with the brake pad wear sensor, which is only located on the front left and rear right wheel).    Use the procedure above.  The sensors are about $100 each.
       </p>
       <p>
        The steering angle sensor is accessible from inside the cabin.  You can find a picture of its location by searching for it on www.realoem.com/bmw.

        Technically speaking, both data busses are the same, but used for different modules. I-Bus is mainly used for multimedia devices such as radio, telephone, steering wheel controls, and so on. On other hand, K-Bus is used for modules such as GM or IHKA. However, both busses are connected to instrument cluster (IKE) which acts as a router between two busses. This allows I-Bus module to send a message to module on K-Bus, and vise versa.
       </p>
       <p>
        I/K-Bus (further down referred to as a bus) is using single wire for receiving and sending data; pulled high (12V or VBATT) on idle, and down (GND) to send a bit. It operates at the speed rate of 9600 bits per second, 8 data bits, even parity, and single stop bit.

       <p>
        A red battery light on your dash or a car that won't start but has a battery you believe to be good can be signs of a failed or failing alternator.  Check the main electrical connections to confirm they're clean and properly secured.  If the car still has issues but can be driven, most major auto parts stores will test your alternator, battery and starter for free to determine if they're putting out the proper voltage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Replacing an alternator is a fairly easy do-it-yourself.  blog.bavauto.com has an excellent write-up

        </a>
        (note: this how-to is for E46s with automatic transmissions; the instructions are identical for a manual transmission except for the radiator fan removal, which is more involved on an automatic).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sometimes, just the voltage regulator can be replaced (black part that bolts onto the back of the unit) for much less than the whole unit.
       </p>
       <p>
        A failed alternator has symptoms nearly identical to a failed battery.  Make certain you have a correct diagnosis before replacing one or the other.
       </p>
       <p>
        After replacing your alternator, do not start the car unless your battery is charged.

       </h4>
       <p>
        As the engine gets beyond 150k miles, the timing chain has stretched/worn a little and the tensioner spring has lost some tension so it is probably a good idea to replace the spring.

        The most common oil leak spots are the VCG - Valve Cover Gasket (see Engine/Troubleshooting below); CCV - Crankcase Vent/Oil Separator and related hoses(see Maintenance above); the OFHG - Oil Filter Housing Gasket (see Maintenance above); and the Oil Pan Gasket.  Make sure you know exactly where the oil is coming from as all the oil leaks run down and probably make the oil pan gasket look like it's leaking whether it is or not.
       </p>
       <p>
        The oil pan gasket is very difficult to repair as it involves lowering the oil pan, which involves lowering the front subframe cross-brace (metal "belly pan").  See

        Note: This is an attempt to explain the purpose and work principle of crankcase ventilation valve (CCV/CVV). The information provided is do be consumed with a grain of salt as it is based on online research and observations. Please do edit if mistake is found.
       </p>
       <p>
        Engine produces gasses when it is running. Those gasses are collected in valve cover, and with no where to escape the (positive) pressure will build up and cause the cover to crack (or oil will leak). Dumping those gasses into environment or back into intake would result in one of two problems. First, there would be no pressure in valve cover thus performance will be affected. Second, dumping gasses would pollute air and result in horrible smell near the car. Therefore, crankcase ventilation valve system is the solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Diagram to be added
        </i>
        CCV itself consist of three ports that are used. Bottom port is connected to oil pan; middle port is connected to valve cover; and finally top port is connected to intake vacuum. Topmost part of CCV consists of rubber membrane (orange), spring, and chamber where it is all mounted. The spring, rubber membrane, and intake vacuum work together to regulate the pressure in valve cover to a specific value. More detailed explanation is described below.
       </p>
       <p>
        With engine idling the intake pressure is high, thus membrane closes the intake vacuum port. In this state, all the gasses escape to the oil pan.
When car is being driven or RPMs are increased, increased pressure in valve cover causes the membrane to open intake vacuum port. Until pressure is lowered, some of the gasses are routed to intake manifold.
       </p>
       <p>
        In case of CCV failure, orange membrane is broken causing vacuum leak which will eventually suck up the oil from oil pan.

       <p>
        The check engine light comes on when the key is turned to position II (key on, engine off) as a test of the bulb/circuit itself.  If your check engine light is on while the car is running, the car's diagnostic computer has detected an error from one of the many monitoring sensors on the car.  Some errors can be as simple as not tightening the gas cap enough (in which case the SES light will turn off by itself after resolving the issue and some driving), or slightly more involved, like a cracked and leaky rubber tube/boot that takes air from the air filter box to the engine (which, to turn off the service light, will require correcting the problem and clearing the code logged in the computer with a scan tool).  The best course of action when this light appears is to obtain a scan tool and scan the computer for the error codes (aka diagnostic trouble codes DTCs).
       </p>
       <p>
        Peake makes scan tools that read BMW specific codes, and there are many "universal" code readers out there from other vendors that will also work very well with your BMW.  Autel makes a popular model, probably due to it's affordability - the MS300.  There are also apps for mobile devices now that can be hooked up to the OBDII port with an adapter - Torque for Android and one for iPhone was released late 2013.  PA Soft for the PC is more expensive but offers in-depth scanning and real-time monitoring of performance parameters.  INPA is also PC based and can be obtained for free on the internet, but is not the easiest to install or use.

        When the key is turned to position 1 (on but not to crank position), you should hear a dull buzz from the passenger back seat area where the pump is.  Checking for voltage at the pump connector - you should read about 5 volts at the pump for about 1 second when the key is turned on.  A fuel filter with greater than 60,000 miles can restrict fuel flow and cause performance issues, and can strain the pump.

        Idle problems can also be caused by failure of the VANOS system.  You can confirm this by seeing if your idle returns to normal after unplugging the VANOS wiring harness. BMW used an inferior material for the seal support o-rings and it is known to degrade considerably in as little as 40,000 miles, negatively affecting low end torque and engine smoothness in general.

        Most likely your valve cover gasket (VCG) has failed and needs replacement.  Can usually confirm by inspecting the silver heat shield over the exhaust manifold and blotting a clean paper towel along the passenger side of the engine where the valve cover meets the head, looking for fresh oil.  See VANOS failure above for procedures on the VCG replacement.  It's a good time to refresh the seals in the VANOS at this time as the valve cover has to come off for VANOS service.

       </h3>
       <p>
        Your owners manual states you should use premium (At least 91 octane as measured by the R+M/2 method in the US).  If you use a lesser grade fuel, your car will retard timing to avoid detonation, which will decrease fuel economy and reduce power.  Premium fuel is even less of a price premium as gas prices increase since it's almost always either 20 or 25 cents higher than regular.  Using regular might cost you more because you'll get less gas mileage but you will hear pinging (mostly in the summer) when mileage drops.

        It is also recommended to add one bottle of Chevron Techron or BMW Fuel Injector cleaner every 3,000-5,000 miles or once per oil change.

        It is a light sensor which affects how brightly the on board computer and radio lights are displayed, based on how bright it is in the cabin. Test it out by getting in your car at night, starting it, turning on the headlights, then taking the flashlight out of the glove compartment and shining it at the sensor. The displays mentioned above should become much brighter.

         Removing the door panel on coupes
        </b>
        - there are three screws in the door handle, one behind the circle cover in the open/pull lever cavity, and one behind the little airbag badge.  Then start pulling at the lower panel corner just like on the sedans.  Inside the door, the window is held to the lift bracket with an external torx bolt (E7?), vs. a low-profile hex head bolt on the sedans.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's believed that the windows sticking to the rubber seals when closed stresses the plastic cable-holder on opening, and this can be lessened by treating your seals so they don't stick - "gummiflege" or glycerine.  Also, lubing the lifting tracks on the regulator can help - some say white lithium grease but the original grease is a thicker, sticky grease (probably waterproof since that part of the door sees water), which may be sold as a "waterproof grease" at auto parts stores.  Some recommend a squirt of a silicone-type of oil at the top of the window channels near the top of the door.  Less binding, less stress on the plastic cable-holder or zip-tie fix.  Careful with the foam vapor barrier, cut the tarry adhesive with a thin flexible knife and heat with hairdryer to make more pliable/ensure good reseal.  You can buy more of the adhesive "ribbon seal" at auto parts stores if you need to refresh.  Also don't lose the felt grommets off all the plastic pop rivets for the door panel.

        To reset sunroof if won't close, hold button in up position (towards roof) for 20 seconds, then push forward.  This may resolve problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        When screwing the glass back on to the slide mounts be sure to push the glass up slightly so that the screws do not rest on the slide mount, it will not allow enough clearance for the roof to open and close properly. You will most likely also notice a large gap due to the sunroof sitting up to a 1/4" lower then the top of the roof.

       <p>
        There are many wheels available for the E46.  The bolt pattern is 5x120, 72mm center bore, and the offset for both front and rear need to be between +35 and +50, and fitting the outer limits of that range will depend on selected tire size.   323/325/328s can use 16" or bigger wheels.   The 330s must use 17" or bigger wheels to clear the brakes, with two exceptions - there are two known 16" wheels that will fit over the 330s brakes: the ASA JH3, and the 16x7.5 AT Italia Type 5.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most E46s with the sport package came with staggered wheels and tires; that is, the rears are wider than the fronts.  This /negatively/ affects performance because it encourages understeer. Of course, understeer is safer than oversteer, so that's the way BMW err's.
       </p>
       <p>
        The widest non-staggered size that you can run seems to be 255/35/18.  jvr826 has these on 18x8.5 wheels with a +42 offset and KrisL has these on 4 rear ZHP wheels (18x8.5 with a +50 offset).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rear M3 wheels will NOT fit on a non-M3 (the rear M3 offset is +24), but the fronts will.  You can buy four FRONT M3 wheels and put them on all four corners of a non-M car.  If you're wondering "what it would take to get rear M3 wheels on the car"... it would take thousands of dollars in body work to get the fenders wide enough - its just not worth it when there are many great aftermarket wheel designs that will look and fit great, as well as giving you a nice staggered look, if that's what you're after.  Check out the offerings by umnitza.com, jlevisw.com, europeanautosource.com, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        5-series wheels have a different center bore/hub size and therefore should not be used. For standard BMW bore/hub size reference please see

       <p>
        When removing alloy wheels, note that a galvanic reaction may have set in between the alloy and the wheel hub, "sticking" the wheel to the hub.  To encourage the wheel to come off, jack the car up with your preferred method, so the tire is approximately 1" off the ground.  Using a heavy (e.g. sledge) hammer, place a block of thick wood (e.g. 4 X 4) behind the wheel.  Hit until the wheel is dislodged.  You may have to alternate sides of the wheel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before replacing the wheel, smear a thin layer of quality lithium grease on the wheel hub landing.  This will make removal of the wheel easier next time.

          Still having fitment a issue where I am experiencing vibration. Never had this issue with the oem wheels. I'm on my second set of TSW's which are made in China, so no surprise on quality issues. Most likley will be returning these for another brand or put oem's back on.

          I dont exactly have a radical setup or anything. The 35 offset is the main difference from the stock offset of 47, that's about a half inch according to my tape measure. my wheels are 1/2 inch wider than stock and I only went up one size (225 to 235) on the tire width. Stock size for my car is a 17x7.5 wheel with a 225/45/17 tire.

          Running Michelin PS2 I had no need to roll my fenders, tho there was very minor rubbing under compression. Once I switched brand and model of tire, fender roll and clipping of the plastic fender liner was required on the passenger rear to avoid rubbing the sidewall of the tire. I still have rubbing deep into the fender well metal on BOTH sides with my setup, but as the tires wear down, it is less of an issue, yet still there. Rubbing occurs under suspension compression when carving canyons and driving enthusiastically. Freeway trips with no load are fine.

         Aerodynamics/Body Kits
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The aerodynamics packages installed on E46 cars from the factory varied according to model year, body style and trim level. Flexible ordering/optioning ensured that customers in European and most world markets typically had a variety of aerodynamics packages to choose from.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the US market, a more specific set of guidelines can be used to determine the aerodynamics package installed on a particular car:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Prefacelift sedan (1999-2001 323i/325i/328i/330i)
        </li>
        <li>
         Prefacelift coupe/convertible (2000-2003 323Ci/325Ci/328Ci/330Ci)
        </li>
        <li>
         Prefacelift BMW Accessories Aero Kit (optional dealer installed accessory kit for prefacelift cars; very rare)
        </li>
        <li>
         Facelift sedan (2002-2005 325i/330i)
        </li>
        <li>
         Facelift coupe/convertible (2004-2006 325Ci/330Ci)
        </li>
        <li>
         M-tech I (2001-2005 330i with ZSP/Sport package, sedan only including prefacelift)
        </li>
        <li>
         M-tech II (2003-2005 330i with ZHP/Performance package / 2004-2006 330Ci with ZHP)
        </li>
        <li>
         M3 (2001-2006 M3, all)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In most world markets, the M-tech aerodynamic kits were associated with M-sport equipped cars. The original M-tech I design was superseded by M-tech II during later production years. In the US market, M-tech I was found on ZSP equipped 330 sedans regardless of production year and M-tech II was only available with the ZHP options package.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many aftermarket body kits of varying qualities are available for the E46. The most popular OEM retrofit kit is M-tech II (standard equipment on ZHP).  You can purchase it from your local dealer or online from somewhere like www.bavauto.com for $900-1000.  They come unpainted, so you will have to get it painted by a body shop.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other body kits may be bought from Bimmerfest sponsors. This includes a wide range or front and rear bumpers, side skirts, vented hoods and other aftermarket parts. Fitments of these parts are made for almost all models, sedan, coupe and convertible.

        Make sure you put the bulb into the socket oriented the same way as the one you're replacing.  If it's off 180 degrees, you may not be able to remount the socket into the lens housing.  If you have difficulty remounting with the new bulb, try taking the bulb out of the socket and rotating 180 degrees, then remount the socket to the lens housing.

        Your best bet is to stick with OEM if you want 'clear corners'.  Aftermarket lenses are of varying quality and may leak.  The OEM clear corners are manufactured by ULF and can be purchased by many companies such as www.bekkers.com, www.bavauto.com, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        DEPO lenses used to be poor quality, but recent reports are promising and have shown that the quality has improved. They can be purchased much cheaper than OEM from places like www.jlevisw.com.

        Your best bet for installing projector Xenon lights in a car that does not have them available is a plug-and-play headlight replacement such as the Umnitza ( www.umnitza.com ) Projector46 with Orion V2 kit.  They can even be purchased with angel eyes pre-installed. They offer a solution that does not require any reflashing.

        Complete used OEM HID assemblies are also available via Ebay, forum "for-sale" sections, and other sources. Typical prices for a complete set of used (but intact and working) HID headlights range from $400 to $600. Purchasing brand new assemblies via the dealership or an importer is not recommended as the price is generally exorbitant (e.g. $1,100 -- per side).   You not only need the lights, but you also need a new LCM (light control module) and it coded to your car.  This can add another few hundred dollars.

        You may disable the "headlight out" warning by pulling fuse #32. Note that this will not disable the actual light out warning (which would occur if the lights were switched to the on position and one or both failed to activate), only the passive warning which is only triggered when the headlights are set to be off.

        One option is to replace the headlamp projector bowls.  Checkout eBay or similar as the ZKW projector bowls are not available as replacement parts, and the entire assembly lists for approximately $1,200 -- for each side.

        The plastic arm for the front self-leveling sensor is likely broken.  It's visible with a flashlight by turning your wheels all the way to the right and looking above the right control arm.  It's possible to epoxy it back in place (I actually wrapped a zip tie around the whole arm, then used epoxy liberally around the whole thing).  The part is what bolt #4 touches to in

If your late-model self-leveling headlamps are made by ALS/Bosch, the inner pivot next to the levelling solenoid mechanism in the headlamp is prone to breakage. With care and patience you may be able to wire up the broken part as a workaround.

       <p>
        It is also possible for the link from the front lower control arm to the leveling sensor to become inverted if the suspension is relaxed, such as when changing a tire.  When the suspension is reloaded the arm folds down and tells the sensor the front of the car is pointing up.  This may not be readily apparent during a visual inspection.  The link should be vertical, rather than horizontal.  See this thread for more information:

This can affect your alignment and handling.  There are two cures for this problem: Install the stronger strut tower spacers from the 4x4 (See DIY

        The E46, like most BMWs, gain very little from typical performance modifications.  If you were to buy a cold air intake, software, headers, exhaust, and underdrive pullies, you'd be lucky to gain 20-25hp and you'd be $1500-3000 poorer.  Forced induction (supercharger or turbocharger) is the only solution for real power gains.

        A shorter differential is the only significant performance booster without forced induction.   A differential swap is best performed by a shop ( preferably performance-oriented).  Switching to a shorter (higher-numerically) ratio allows the engine to get into the fat part of it`s power band more quickly because it`s spinning a bit faster in any given gear  (kind of like your old 10-speed bike which would accelerate much faster on the small front sprocket as opposed to the big one). For example, changing from a 3.07 gear to a 3.46 gear would give the car lots of extra grunt out of second-gear corners, and would reduce the need for downshifts when passing, etc. The downsides are higher engine RPMs(noise) at highway speeds, and slightly reduced gas mileage.... but with a MUCH higher "fun factor".

        The input flanges from the (323-325) differentials are different than those in the (328-330).  You may have to swap input flanges depending on where you are getting your diff.

        While BMWs are known to be great handling cars, there are certainly plenty of suspension upgrades available:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Powerflex control arm bushings (www.bimmerworld.com) will make turn-in a bit crisper
        </li>
        <li>
         Rear trailing arm bushing limiters (www.motor-force.com) will reduce excessive toe change under cornering force
        </li>
        <li>
         Sway bars (many options such as UUC's SwayBarbarians, www.uucmotorwerks.com) are often referred to as the best suspension mod bang for the buck.  They actually make your suspension LESS independent, but greatly reduce body roll with very little tradeoffs.
        </li>
        <li>
         Shocks/Struts and springs are available.   If you have a car without the sport or performance packages, simply swapping sport/performance package suspension bits will help quite a bit.  If you want to go further, consider adjustable shocks, lowering springs or full coilover kits from GroundControl, Tein, or TC Kline.

         What was the steering retrofit?
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        BMW marketing had feedback that said that their cars took too much effort to turn the wheel in slow speed situations, i.e. parking. BMW modified the steering rack and system to decrease the steering effort. Those owners who have had extensive experience with E36's (previous generation 3 series) or pre June 2000 cars have stated that there was also a resulting loss of road feel through the steering wheel. Many of these board members have dubbed the "new" steering feel equipped cars as the "Ultimate Parking Machine".
       </p>
       <p>
        Various owners have stated that the only E46's spared this steering boost and loss in road feel are those equipped with the all wheel drive option (i.e. Xi's).
       </p>
       <p>
        Current rumors state that the steering rack was modified again starting in Jan. 1, 2001 and that the "old" steering was phased in. Some E46s produced between Jan and April may or may not have the "old" steering. If you are unsure, check out post April 2001 cars and compare steering feel. See these posts from "Ginger" and Jon S.

        . Those with post-April 1, 2001 have stated that the steering feel was indeed not pre-June 2000 feel, but somewhere in between the "new" (June-Dec 2000) and the old (pre-June 2000). The post April 2001 steering has been dubbed as the "new-new" steering. This change was a direct result of feedback through bimmer.org members posting on the E46 board and direct contact with BMW NA. So our voice does count!
       </p>
       <p>
        So the current terminology is:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         "old" feel: pre-June 2000 build
        </li>
        <li>
         "new" feel: June through December 2000 and some Jan-April 2001
        </li>
        <li>
         "new-new" feel: post April 2001
        </li>
        <li>
         "retrofit" feel: early retrofit "pilot" run participants have stated that the retrofit feels somewhere between the "new-new" and the "old" feel.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In response to consumer feedback, BMW NA initiated a program to satisfy owners of MY2001 E46s who prefer less boost in the power steering system. These owners maintain that a loss of 'feel' was associated with the newer systems which had more boost than MY2000 and earlier E46s. Intitially, BMW NA maintained a list of owners who would be interested in changing their steering racks for systems with less boost. People who have called in to have their name added to a list of persons interested in a retrofit back in Jan/Feb began to be contacted starting the week of April 16, 2001 en masse. BMW NA is going through the list and contacting those with 323/325 and 330's that were produced between June and December 2000, and is offering a one-time free-of-charge changeover to a less boosted steering system.
       </p>
       <p>
        BMWNA has been very clear on the statements to those contacted. They typically cover the following items:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Steering rack and components will be replaced with pre-June 2000 components at no charge.
        </li>
        <li>
         You have your choice of BMW centers to install the retrofit.
        </li>
        <li>
         BMWNA will contact your chose center to give them the details and parts needed for the retrofit. BMWNA requests a couple of days before you try to schedule an appointment with your center.
        </li>
        <li>
         BMWNA makes it very clear that the retrofit will make steering more difficult at lower speeds.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        There has been some confusion as to whether June-Dec 2000 325's and post Jan 2001 cars with "new-new" feel were eligible for the retrofit. Latest news is that the post Jan 325/330's are eligible due to the phase in started in Jan 2001. "New-new" feel cars might be and will be evaluated on a case by case basis according to some sources.

        Control arms and control arm bushings are common failure points in the E46.  Control arm bushings can last as little as 40-60k miles with the control arms themselves not far behind.  The most common symptom is the steering not feeling as crisp as it once did; however, there are other worse symptoms such as the car wanting to turn when you jab the brakes.

         Clutch Delay Valve
        </span>
       </h3>
       <p>
        The clutch delay valve is a small valve in the clutch line that restricts clutch fluid flow.  It's designed to prevent shock to the transmission if the clutch is dropped.  The bad part is that it makes the clutch feel vague and can make it difficult to pull off smooth shifts for experienced manual transmission drivers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that installation of a restricted CDV was not made on all manual cars. There are some that do not have one, some that do have one without restriction (same as the delete version) and then a lot of cars that have a restricted CDV. Seems that earlier E46 do not have it and it was phased in sometime in 2001 built dates.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two choices:  Remove the CDV completely (the two ends of the clutch line will screw into each other, requiring no parts) or replace the CDV with a drilled-out version, eliminating the restriction.  People use the drilled-out version to avoid dealer hassles in case a transmission warranty issue arises.
       </p>
       <p>
        After replacing or removing the CDV, you do need to bleed the clutch line.

        Another cause of poor clutch feel is that the factory clutch stop (the plastic piece that prevents the clutch from depressing any further) is too low; that is, you don't need it to go down as far as it does.  You can purchase clutch stops from many aftermarket companies (UUC, Rogue), but I made my own.  More information can be found

         Early automatic transmissions are a weak point in the E46.  The first symptom of a failing transmission is the inability to engage reverse gear.  This issue plagues early E46 owners including 323/328 owners. If you have a 323/328 and think you have the no-reverse problem, check out this thread. It has information on how you might be able to fix your no-reverse issue if you have a GM transmission:

         Resetting TM adaptations can sometimes help with fault codes.  You can reset the TM to the factory settings by doing the following:
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        1)Insert the Key into the ignition (DONT HOLD THE BRAKE).
2)Turn the key, just so the car electronics start and show the Engine light is on. (Dont START the Engine).
3)Press and HOLD the accelerater all the way down for 25 seconds.
4)After those 25 Seconds, proceed to Starting the Engine and drive your car.
       </p>
       <p>
        If done correctly you should feel the car to be more responsive and shift better as it resets the memory in the transmission.

         The most common problem with the climate control system is a bad final stage resistor.  The symptoms of this are erratic fan speed (fan blowing at full speed while the display shows a low fan speed).   You can find replacement information

         If the fan speed DOES match the graph display, but it is constantly/incorrectly adjusting speed *OR* if the climate control unit won't turn off or on, you MAY need to replace the climate control module (IHKA). In the case of constantly/incorrectly adjusting fan speed, try replacing the final stage resistor first.
        </li>
        <li>
         If your climate control won't turn off OR on, the problem is likely the climate control module (IHKA).  If the problem is intermittent, you can usually 'reset' it by pulling out the appropriate fuses for a few seconds.

        As wrong as this sounds, that means the car is low on refrigerant (R134A).  BMWs have a "dual" A/C system that 'favors' the driver's side when the refrigerant runs low.  You should be able to pick up a R134A refill kit at a local auto parts store.
       </p>
       <p>
        See Wingspan's DIYs on how to refill the refrigerant

        Your heater valve could have failed open, constantly heating the air inside the car.  The valve opens to flow hot coolant through the heater core for heat in the car, but should close when heat is not needed.  Here's a good DIY for replacing this part:

        If it's just warm air from some vents (and NOT the passenger side scenario described above indicating low refrigerant) it could be a problem with the control flaps inside the vent system.  Sometimes the vent flap motors (controlling the flaps in the vents that route air to footwells/dash/windshield etc.) will fail or the flaps break.  A fuse for the flap motors can blow too.

        The climate control fan either becomes unbalanced due to accumulation of dirt/dust, gets something caught in its housing (like a leaf or bug), or has worn out its bearings (or possibly just the electrical "brushes" that make it spin).  For DIY and other info., see this

        for opening your trunk without a key.  Going through the ski-pass in the middle is also a relatively clean way.  If your pass-thru isn't openable, you can drill a hole and try to work a coat hangar hook through there to grab the glow in the dark emergency release handle inside the trunk.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you have a dead keyfob in connection with a broken lock cylinder, the best method is to try to revive your dead keyfob with a temporary fresh battery (see electrical section of wiki for full battery replacement DIY).  A simple 3v calculator battery can be wired to your open keyfob in a pinch for a very temporary work around until you can replace the rechargeable battery.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you can't get in using a key, the top corner of the driver's door or passenger's door may be gently pried open a little and then propped open to allow a coat hangar (or simliar) to be slid in to grab one of the interior door handles for the double-pull.  Wrap the prying tools and coat hangar in protective tape so finishes do not get scratched.  Pushing the unlock button will not work as the computer has built in security routines to prevent such a "break-in" attempt.  If the car has been locked with a keyfob remote, the double-pulls will be disabled, but they can be re-enabled by pressing the central lock button by the parking brake handle.  Due to the design of the locking mechanism in the doors, a traditional "slim jim" approach will not work.
