                       I find that very interesting that you cant think of anyone beyond 40 in construction, Im from an area with tons of development and of course the smaller business owners are above 40, still doing their own manual labor (including my father, and my boyfriends father). In fact most of the men in my life are in construction and are 30-50.

                       I know many construction workers well into their late 50s. I also mean heavy construction not light duty. If they are Unionized, even better. They have some of the best benefits and can afford to retire before 65.

                     I agree you can make good money in construction, mining, oil and gas related jobs but  many of these jobs can be labour intensive and not suitable for everybody, they also require a lot more skill than most people think.

                       True but 10-15 years in this sector is equal to 25-30 years in other sectors. More money in shorter periods isnt for increased spending but for reduced working years over a lifetime. Although most people just spend more as they earn more. Going to school means losing several years of prime working time and being burdened with student debt while at the same time providing little security that you will even be hired by the time you get out of school. High school is the biggest example of a waste of time.

                       North American High school is a waste of time*****, and a joke.
                       <br/>
                       TBH, what did you do in high school can you remember what have you learnt? I am a FOB but to my eyes, most students here in North America are jokes, no discipline, no self-control, not studying and dont give a fuck about their life or future. The high school here is already cant be any easier, and still dont wanna study. Blame school to be a waste of time? Please ask yourself did you actually go to school or you just be in school?

                       Hey Canada! Watch out for these far right loonies who despise the educated tree huggers. These guys are trying to justify the destruction of public school in the USA and think it wise that we go to Christian private school to learn intelligent design. They despise science and learning in general. They will look at any justification for their chosen elected officials who are dead set against Obama giving 2 year college tuition free (although you need to keep a certain grade point average to keep attending for free). They seek to justify stupidity and think educated people are snobs. What a hoot, I think Ill be moving to the great white north if this country doesnt get their heads out of Bushs/Cheneys asses.  I mean what kind of society down plays the importance of education? Welcome to the retarded states of murika! What do these far right ass clowns want? We Americans to work for the Japanese or Chinese business owners? They far outdo our students in sciences and mathematics. OOOPs! I mean The three Rs, Reading, riting, and rythmatic. DUh!

                       Yeah, and watch out for these leftists that want YOU to pay for everyone else; but preferable if that someone else is female or a minority.  Its bad enough that schools are leftist indoctrination camps.   Take a look at the US debt level. In a few years, or sooner if interest rates go up, you will be bankrupt, and there go all your pet social programs.

                       Foreign wars to bolster the support of presidents havent been paid for since Bush Sr. tried to introduce an income surtax to pay for the first Iraq invasion.  From then on Iraq and Afghanistan adventures have been funded from a ballooning deficit.  Thats a very cost-ineffective way to teach Americas boys about geography.  By comparison the cost of social programs like universal health care are small change.

                       Im in high school and i can tell you right now i am learning things my mom learned in university, studies show that not just high school but schools in general give almost twice as much work as they did 30 years ago, adults wonder why all these teens are commiting  suicide and turning to the drug industry, its an easy answer, because teachers and principles are putting tons of un-needed stress on every kid. 4 years of high school shouldnt define who your going to be and what you get grades wise shouldnt define how smart you are, 14 to 18 are some of the best years of your life, and there are so many kids who are missing out on amazing opportunitys and events because of the stress that comes with school and homework.

                       Are you for real Kendall? Im a university librarian and I can tell you many kids coming out of high schools are illiterate today. They cant even spell properly or write a decent essay. I went to McGill years ago and believe me it was tough! I returned to University a few years ago and cant believe how much easier students have it now. Much higher grades are given than when I was in university before. Much less is expected of average students today than years ago. You dont know what youre talking about.

                       Yeaaaa having the internet is gamechanging tool when in comes to studies.  Having a succesful high school grades is important because it is a joke. Doesnt take much to get a diploma with minimal commitment

                       Thats true. People who think those jobs are easy are the ones who lose body parts in an accident. Sure, you can make 100k a year on the rigs, but that is a rough life.

                       That depends They dont like to hire any yokel but Ive heard of it done. If you dont care about what you do for a living as long as it makes you money post-secondary is a waste of time and money. I say that as a college student. If you want to expand your mind, be more respectable, and make good money (does depend on the field) doing something you are passionate about post secondary is virtually a necessity. My parents have low income but they did save what they could for us,encourage us to work and save and use government grants so I do have money to pay at least part of my education. It is basically not an option, even if for a trade or something that doesnt require much schooling to not attend post secondary (assuming respect for parents).

                       Well put Doug, couldnt have said it better myself. Another point Ill add is that the time you spend at college/university is a life experience which is imo more than worth the 4 years you spend completing it.

                       Lets put it this way, Ive come to Calgary to pursue jobs in person, am completing my PhD and cant beg or barter my way into a job due to being over qualified, and Ive been here almost a year and actively putting 100% effort in job searches for 6 months.  My friend who did half of a 2 year course at a local tech college before dropping out, this after scrapping through high school, is now getting paid somewhere around $150+k/yr to be a grunt laborer and could be worth more if he applied himself.  I have another friend that decided after 3 years of vacation style living after high school to go get a 2 year BA at UofC (again, not top notch student, so minimal requirement) and hes now a highly payed consulting analyst.  Heck, of the dozen or more friends from high school that live here that I still know, the more education they got, the less they are making, and this is 10 years after high school.  Some graduate studies CAN be benificial IF you pick 1-2 year MBA or JD programs and are an upper end student, or stay in school into your 30s (MD), but honestly with economic decline most of the country, its really not worth it.  Im coming out of a PhD having worked through most of my teens (in high school) and 20s to set myself up, not for now, but in the future as to not hit any blocks trying to climb the corporate ladder.  And yes, struggling to understand the simple concepts of our high schools and taking a &gt;1 year course to be an expert in a trade does make you any yokel (just any yokel that wants to make a killing digging holes, taking breaks or driving big trucks).  Apparent to me now, when I do finally crack that egg, I either work my way to the top, or (more likely) ride a similar track to ppl who put less effort for less time in easier degrees and work more years to come out even (after paying off the extra years of graduate school).  Cost of universities have sky rocketed, available jobs have diminished, cost of living (housing, food, fuel, utilites, etc) are way out of whack with wages related to 30+ years ago and the few strong Canadian markets (for some reason) really dont want intelligent employees, just cheep seats to fill offices and happy grunt workers.  University really doesnt make economic sense.  If you go, do it for yourself, the knowledge you can obtain and the security late in your career it will give you, but dont believe the lie that you will be a desirable candidate or will automatically make more money.  If its money you want by the easiest means possible, my advice, scrape through high school, enjoy your youth, then take a 6 month course to operate heavy machinery and make a killing ($100-300k) in Ft. Mac for 10+ years and retire young.

                     Worked in the sector for a bit, and the foremen of the labour make the big bucks. So unless youre in the top 10% of managing in that company, youre making a good wage, but not anything exceptionally good.

                     Also, if you do break the 100K barrier, its because youre working in Alberta, Fort Mac, Fort St John in northern BC and youre totally isolated and your costs of living are extremely high, lack of housing options, and other pitfalls. Youre probably working overtime and if you deduct from the pay the costs of living, transportation it might not be significant enough a difference to make it worth being totally isolated and in a job that is high risk. Also, the mining sector is incredibly unstable and prone to dips (see 2008 crash where every mine except first-class mines shut down for a period)

                     You can make a bunch of money as a long haul trucker, but do you want to be working 10 hours a day for 3 days every other day and always seated? There are truckers who make over 100K but they are always on the road, showering in truck stops, eating out, and away from social contacts (might be a plus)

                     Good work depends on how you define it, but you have to look above the bottom line, and there are commonalities that need to be there: Stability, reasonable health conditions, and opportunity for growth and mobility.

                     if ur working a job like that youll get hurt or killed because of lack of knowledge. not a good idea without proper training.  which is really easy.. if u dont have the money get talk to welfare or go to MacDonalds save the money and get a trade. u dont have to break ur back. u can drive a dump truck and fix one.  If u wanna make more money it gets dangerous but with that you get more training and learn to deal with those situations.

                     However, in these areas where the natural resources industry is booming and providing big bucks, the price of housing/property and other expenses are skyrocketing, so much of the big money a laborer makes goes right down the drain.  Also, student debts are not a big problem in canada, as it costs maybe a quarter of what it takes to go to school in the states

                     Actually, the reason why the average salary in mining, construction, and oil industries is so high is because either 1) You are an engineer, or 2) Your putting your life at risk on a daily basis. If your not making either one of those, your likely not earning that much in those industries. Stay in school.

                   Youre the retard if you think staying in school is the only way someone can make over 100k. Keep on buying into societys bullshit bud. See where your life ends up.

                     lmao, you think Real Estate agents are highschool drop out or what? Yes maybe there are some, but most of them are educated at least went to college. You think it requires no skill/professions and can make you good money, why dont we just all go to those jobs and forget about education? I admit there are people can be a great artist/scientist or anything without formal education, but they are talented, not for everyone.

                   There are no careers than earn over 100k that do not require a solid education.  There are jobs, but you need to go way the hell up north and youre being paid a high wage because of that.  Not everybody wants to date a moose, so yes, youre correct.

                     Agreed. They also forget the the only reason they get paid 100K + up north is because 1.) no one wants to be up there 2.) no one wants to do those jobs, and 3.) cost of living there is also ridiculous Make gross of 10K/mo, taxed 3500+, rent for shared room of $2000+. oh and working 80 hour weeks. so basically you net $10-14/hr in your pocket after your expenses be a bus driver in Calgary and you will net the same amount plus you can retire 20 yrs later with full pension.

                       Not even close, John.
                       <br/>
                       I earn well over 100k a year .. Over 40, Dropped out of high school in grade 10 (not proud, but whatever). I live in Edmonton, Im home every night in my own bed, there is no hard labor involved .. And I get to work with and meet great people .. Maybe you should consider being a Hotshot, John?
                       <br/>
                       And as for your Calgary bus driver analogy? Your numbers are whack, sorry. Yes, you see moose up there .. Yes, you might work in isolated locations .. And yes, you might pay $2000 a month, for a room .. If the oil company didnt fly you in, put you up at camp, with satellite, internet, work out facilities, and good food.
                       <br/>
                       Even the ones that do pay, to live in town .. They play hard. Sometimes two and three times a week, maybe more. That gets expensive. Its just living the life. Anyways, they do all that, pay all that .. And still come home after two or three weeks, with that 10k, Not your menial wages. We wouldnt be doing it, otherwise. Dont think so? Where do you think all those beautiful houses, toy haulers, sleds, trucks, bikes, boats, hot rods, and artillery come from?
                       <br/>
                       That $11 an hour were making? The perfect credit rating we all have? Not.
                       <br/>
                       Some of us really do earn good money ..  ..
                       <br/>
                       Then again .. .. Maybe, its just me.

                       I am making 65k (yes much less than you) and other benefit. But I am only graduated from school few month ago and I live in a city. I will cry if I know some high school drop out at my age earn 65k a year. Anyway, I do know one person drop out of high school when he was 18, now he is 23 and make 70k a year, but this guy works harder (not physical labor kind of hard) than everyone I know on this earth, he did not go to college just because he can not afford it and his parents divorced and no one would give him financial care and he got kicked out of home when he turn 19.

                       My 17 year old niece also makes $20.00/hour tutoring.  Its far from full time but with no traditional student jobs available anymore she had to make her own.  My 9 year old earns $8/hr, also tutoring for 4 hours a week.  She is also an avid gardener.  We have several friends in real estate, and she has lined up some summer jobs for her and her 17 year old cousin, also at $20.00/hr landscaping.  Jobs that dont require a high school education, but do require more skills than another kid that age may have, AND the initiative to make our own gardens the envy of the neighbourhood, AND the courage to suggest to our adult friends that the girls could help people that are moving into new homes.  I like the initiative that theyve both taken, but Im glad to know the 17 year old already has her eyes set on a University, and the 9 year old turned something that she loves to do into a pretty good job for a kid her age.  The crappy part of having a young child working is that we dont claim her as a dependent and get a tax credit.  She files her own income tax return.

                       Actually..if youre like my cousin who lives in Edmonton works in Fort Mcmurray and drives his hourly commute everyday to work and back. I think cost of living would go down.

                       after reading all these posts im glad i got into welding and can go north where every one doesnt care what the fuck you dumb fucks think we go to work in crap areas and crap jobs because we love what we do thats why we go north and work long hours. we love what we do we may make lots of money and half to spend a lot of it on expenses but we dont care because we love our jobs we are skilled workers in a very challenging field and people who say welding is easy can come to st thomas ontario and prove it so before you start bad mouthing these jobs that nobody wants try the job and there are lots of people who dont want a trades job but there is just as many that do we love our work and thats all there is to it

                     I know quite a few people in my profession, that only have High School and are making over 100K. So School maybe good but I find it to be waste of time

                       that only means you wasted your time at school. My education helped me to build my career and I am using what I have learnt from school to make a living.

                       Waste of time for those who care not for what they are doing as long as they are making money. To help one enjoy life they should be doing something they dont hate for 1/2 their waking life, which often needs some level of post secondary schooling. For those who enjoy, or at least put up with things that are not enjoyable for the promise of a paycheck, thats cool. I am a college student but I would say that throughout high school post secondary education was over emphasized. Some arent meant to do any more formal studying, theres a place for them in this great big world too.

                     Wrong, I am living proof and whole heartedly disagree. A Red Seal Tradesman like myself earns a solid 100k gross 40 hrs/week. Dont even need overtime to make it. I live in B.C. and work in competitive a non-union company. All my colleagues are on the same boat. We went to trade school and fulfilled our 5 year aprrenticeship. I would not call that a solid education. It has atouch of acedemics , yes, but not at university degree levels. YOU DO NOT NEED A HIGH EDUCATION DEGREE TO MAKE 6 FIGURES IN CANADA!!! Total BS

                     absolutely right. However, this also depends on what some people might think a solid education entails.  For some, the very definition of education stems from university degrees etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I personally think that a solid education is whatever type of learning youll need to build a solid foundation on whatever it is youre trying to work towards.  After successfully completing the foundations, you blossom from there on.

                     To be honest, I make a little over 100k a year as an auto tech. (i work for myself) I wouldnt be able to achieve project contracts or gain clientele if I were deemed uneducated in my field of work.  So granted, education in this perspective is undeniably quintessential for higher earnings.

                     I am 42 and live in the Windsor area (one of the highest unemployment regions of Canada) and I do make over a $100k a year working 9-5 mon-fri. I had 8 years of good education in a private school in Manitoba but did not even attend high school. I will admit that I feel like a very privileged individual when I see other people with a lot more education then me struggling. I started out working for a small manufacting company (30 employees) from age 18-24 in manufacturing, hands on work making $15-$18 in the early 90s. In 96 at age 24 I got promoted into sales. They paid me $10 per hour plus a sales commission. That first year in sales (1996) I earned $96000. I stayed with this company until 2005. That year the company sold and I switched to selling construction and ag equipment. I had grower up on a farm in MB and always wanted to try this type of sales. My pay dropped into the 50-60 range but I was ready for a change. After 2 years of that in 2007 I was offered a job as a territory sales manager for a company with minimal travel 2-3 weeks a year and $60k salary plus commision. I took that position and am still here at it today and making over a $100k per year.  I have turned down 3 offers in the past 8 years including two of them were big name brand construction equipment companies all offer me sales positions that they gaurentied me over $100k. My company treats me very well so why switch. I do in turn give them my best. I suppose that may be the reason offer companies keep coming to me with the offers the do. Some of them have been my bosses compition. I closing let me add that I did not land not one of these positions because of family or friends connections. I contribute my total success to my first employer, I gave him my I best I could and he pulled me up from there.

                     lmao, self-employed and make millions. Have you tried? hows that going? You think people can just be successful without being professional? Maybe going for education is not the only way to get professionalized but it is a good way. What a opportunist, indeed this world needs more of your kind.

                     Entrepreneurship takes harder work than most jobs. Unless a revolutionary invention/idea just pops into your head and you know all the right people to make it into a successful business, having ones own business is more work, in the majority of situations, than simply working for someone else.

                       Stable employment is a bit of a myth in itself. Just because you are working for a company doesnt mean its stable. School is never a bad thing. Any education is never a bad thing, but the idea of that you cant make a stable high earning income without going to traditional university or college, it a complete cultural hoax. Education is what is important to succeed in life not School. There is a difference.

                   School is waste of time as I had been through it twice for two different things. Most employers dont care about your degree, diploma and even less about how bright and sharp you were at school. I am not making 100K but I am very close to making it, and my advice to any one thinking of getting a better salary career is to explore current professions in demand such as various feild in Technology

                   Sales, especially real estate.  I do agree though, overall the longer you stay in school, the higher income you can expect (and rightly should).  The exception seems to be the GAS and Arts degrees.  But people that possess amazing soft skills that you just cant learn in schools make a killing in sales.

                   I quit college and make over a hundred grand, fool. Staying in school simply means you will most likely have a shitload of student loans to pay off, and then when you become a physician (or whatever you believe high earners are), you will probably buy a useless $2 million dollar house to show off, because you never learned the value of money. Now use your effing head. Next?

                   JUST POINT TO ANY UNION JOB.  As long as unions blackmail the public for raises we will see Janitors that earn over 100k/yr.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also earned over 100k running a printing press when I was younger, but technology has made that job mostly extinct.

                     **** you buddy, you are just jealous and ungrateful. Tradesman myself earning $120k clear/yr. If it werent for Unions like ours standing up to the big companies fighting for fair treatment, wages and competitive benefits, taking in to account the cost of living these days, yould be working for $12/hr you dumb schmuck!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Either get a ticket in a trade and actually have to work to make the big bucks, or keep pretending to work earning that piddly $28/hr wage you make and belly aching about how others are pulling in $170k/yr because they WORK FOR IT!

                       I was a tradesman who was making $32.60 an hour when I was with a union and half of that when I was not.  That was decent money back in the day.  Double that on weekends I was making over a dollar a minute.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       My trade got demolished by the computer industry and technology already.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Printing presses can now run 6 times as fast with a smaller crew which eliminated 90% of the necessary people without a thing the Union could do to stop technology.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Then suddenly paper was not used in phone books, books, and everywhere printing was 20 years ago is mostly digital advertising now including subway posters, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Printing went from the largest trade to the smallest in a few short years.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You claim to be a tradesman..  Well isnt that nice..
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Non union jobs do not make piddly $28/hr..  It is more like minimum wage if I were to get back out there.  Im retired.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The truth is 90% of government positions are Union positions and the key to earning big money for your kids is to have them go into some form of government work.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Police, Fireman, (Those are not trades) They are all overpaid.  A cop can make $90/hr just guarding a hole in the street for ditch diggers, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Bus drivers and Ambulance drivers Those are not trades
                       <br/>
                       My friend lost two jobs due to lengthy bus strikes in my city.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You think a pressman could make more than $12/hour now?  Maybe there are a few pressmen left earning big bucks, but they are few and far between.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Your job is not safer either.  Every faster machine and advancement in tech puts a few of your co workers out of work.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       One day even buses will drive themselves and the police force will be mostly drones.

                      <p>
                       I may have sympathy for your position if you are an Electrician, Plumber, Sheetmetal worker, but the majority of unions these days are for places full of lazy government workers like The unemployment office, and your favorite welfare workers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Those jobs are not trades, and their unions are protecting jobs that are not necessary in a lot of instances.

                       In Canada.  The hospital industry is resisting TUG ROBOTS.  In the United States TUG robots have replaced much hospital staff delivering laundry and meals on wheels from the hospital basement to the required rooms.

                       My comment was based upon anger towards the writer of this Workopolis Writer.   Every few months they say if you want a high paying job they list the top ten and they are always union and 90% of union jobs are not by tradesmen.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I think ALL government jobs are Union actually..  I am pressed to think of any who are not unionized.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Ive worked my hours.  Raised my family.  Paid my dues.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       If you are in a legitimate trade then I can see your view, but then I wonder why you are anging around unemployment websites like workopolis if you are making what you claim if you are even working.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Sounds like a lie though.   A guy claiming to make $170/k a year hanging around workopolis?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I stand by my original comment.   You are obviously either lying or too irrational to be working in any responsible position.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I mean you jumped in with a **** You because I suggested 2 months at a truck driving schools does not warrant a Union Position with a bus company..
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Unions died a long time ago.  Your union just has not gotten the memo yet..  If in fact you even work.

                   Sales jobs. My hubby earns over $200K a year, after just 1 year on the job. Many of his colleagues who do not have degrees make similar amounts so yes, there are options. I also know several others who make over 100K and have not finished school, again in sales.

Its just Im spending like 60 grand a year at Princeton for an education and whenever people make it sound like education is pointless, it really irritates me because theres a lot of things I would rather spend 60 grand on than a psychology degree.

                 I think its funny how people like you think. The people you depend on the most without even knowing it are the ones that get the education you just called a joke. If you ever got sick, Id like to see you go to some hippy doctor who almost passed grade ten science instead of someone who went to medical school for 10 years plus. The people who have the determination to actually try and achieve something instead of just thinking why dont I work really hard at some mining job for ten years only to be 50 and bankrupt because it was too hard on your back. Just because you didnt see the need in an actual education doesnt mean that education is a joke. BTW, thats not how you spell Ive.

                   oh wow~! this was 2 years ago when I was 18 years old. Education is not a joke but saying that education is the only way you can make big bucks is, I have no post secondary now.  last year I pulled in close to a quarter of a million. Thats with no help from anyone. Just need to invest your earnings if you can and build your own wealth. I also sit on my ass most of the day and have my paychecks come in. Ive* sorry I didnt finish high school english class at the time. lol

                       I find that very interesting that you cant think of anyone beyond 40 in construction, Im from an area with tons of development and of course the smaller business owners are above 40, still doing their own manual labor (including my father, and my boyfriends father). In fact most of the men in my life are in construction and are 30-50.

                       I know many construction workers well into their late 50s. I also mean heavy construction not light duty. If they are Unionized, even better. They have some of the best benefits and can afford to retire before 65.

                     I agree you can make good money in construction, mining, oil and gas related jobs but  many of these jobs can be labour intensive and not suitable for everybody, they also require a lot more skill than most people think.

                       True but 10-15 years in this sector is equal to 25-30 years in other sectors. More money in shorter periods isnt for increased spending but for reduced working years over a lifetime. Although most people just spend more as they earn more. Going to school means losing several years of prime working time and being burdened with student debt.

                       North American High school is a waste of time*****, and a joke.
                       <br/>
                       TBH, what did you do in high school can you remember what have you learnt? I am a FOB but to my eyes, most students here in North America are jokes, no discipline, no self-control, not studying and dont give a fuck about their life or future. The high school here is already cant be any easier, and still dont wanna study. Blame school to be a waste of time? Please ask yourself did you actually go to school or you just be in school?

                       Hey Canada! Watch out for these far right loonies who despise the educated tree huggers. These guys are trying to justify the destruction of public school in the USA and think it wise that we go to Christian private school to learn intelligent design. They despise science and learning in general. They will look at any justification for their chosen elected officials who are dead set against Obama giving 2 year college tuition free (although you need to keep a certain grade point average to keep attending for free). They seek to justify stupidity and think educated people are snobs. What a hoot, I think Ill be moving to the great white north if this country doesnt get their heads out of Bushs/Cheneys asses.  I mean what kind of society down plays the importance of education? Welcome to the retarded states of murika! What do these far right ass clowns want? We Americans to work for the Japanese or Chinese business owners? They far outdo our students in sciences and mathematics. OOOPs! I mean The three Rs, Reading, riting, and rythmatic. DUh!

                       Yeah, and watch out for these leftists that want YOU to pay for everyone else; but preferable if that someone else is female or a minority.  Its bad enough that schools are leftist indoctrination camps.   Take a look at the US debt level. In a few years, or sooner if interest rates go up, you will be bankrupt, and there go all your pet social programs.

                       Foreign wars to bolster the support of presidents havent been paid for since Bush Sr. tried to introduce an income surtax to pay for the first Iraq invasion.  From then on Iraq and Afghanistan adventures have been funded from a ballooning deficit.  Thats a very cost-ineffective way to teach Americas boys about geography.  By comparison the cost of social programs like universal health care are small change.

                       Im in high school and i can tell you right now i am learning things my mom learned in university, studies show that not just high school but schools in general give almost twice as much work as they did 30 years ago, adults wonder why all these teens are commiting  suicide and turning to the drug industry, its an easy answer, because teachers and principles are putting tons of un-needed stress on every kid. 4 years of high school shouldnt define who your going to be and what you get grades wise shouldnt define how smart you are, 14 to 18 are some of the best years of your life, and there are so many kids who are missing out on amazing opportunitys and events because of the stress that comes with school and homework.

                       Are you for real Kendall? Im a university librarian and I can tell you many kids coming out of high schools are illiterate today. They cant even spell properly or write a decent essay. I went to McGill years ago and believe me it was tough! I returned to University a few years ago and cant believe how much easier students have it now. Much higher grades are given than when I was in university before. Much less is expected of average students today than years ago. You dont know what youre talking about.

                       Thats true. People who think those jobs are easy are the ones who lose body parts in an accident. Sure, you can make 100k a year on the rigs, but that is a rough life.

                       That depends They dont like to hire any yokel but Ive heard of it done. If you dont care about what you do for a living as long as it makes you money post-secondary is a waste of time and money. I say that as a college student. If you want to expand your mind, be more respectable, and make good money (does depend on the field) doing something you are passionate about post secondary is virtually a necessity. My parents have low income but they did save what they could for us,encourage us to work and save and use government grants so I do have money to pay at least part of my education. It is basically not an option, even if for a trade or something that doesnt require much schooling to not attend post secondary (assuming respect for parents).

                       Well put Doug, couldnt have said it better myself. Another point Ill add is that college/university is a life experience which is imo more than worth the 4 years you spend completing it.

                       Lets put it this way, Ive come to Calgary to pursue jobs in person, am completing my PhD and cant beg or barter my way into a job due to being over qualified, and Ive been here almost a year and actively putting 100% effort in job searches for 6 months.  My friend who did half of a 2 year course at a local tech college before dropping out, this after scrapping through high school, is now getting paid somewhere around $150+k/yr to be a grunt laborer and could be worth more if he applied himself.  I have another friend that decided after 3 years of vacation style living after high school to go get a 2 year BA at UofC (again, not top notch student, so minimal requirement) and hes now a highly payed consulting analyst.  Heck, of the dozen or more friends from high school that live here that I still know, the more education they got, the less they are making, and this is 10 years after high school.  Some graduate studies CAN be benificial IF you pick 1-2 year MBA or JD programs and are an upper end student, or stay in school into your 30s (MD), but honestly with economic decline most of the country, its really not worth it.  Im coming out of a PhD having worked through most of my teens (in high school) and 20s to set myself up, not for now, but in the future as to not hit any blocks trying to climb the corporate ladder.  And yes, struggling to understand the simple concepts of our high schools and taking a &gt;1 year course to be an expert in a trade does make you any yokel (just any yokel that wants to make a killing digging holes, taking breaks or driving big trucks).  Apparent to me now, when I do finally crack that egg, I either work my way to the top, or (more likely) ride a similar track to ppl who put less effort for less time in easier degrees and work more years to come out even (after paying off the extra years of graduate school).  Cost of universities have sky rocketed, available jobs have diminished, cost of living (housing, food, fuel, utilites, etc) are way out of whack with wages related to 30+ years ago and the few strong Canadian markets (for some reason) really dont want intelligent employees, just cheep seats to fill offices and happy grunt workers.  University really doesnt make economic sense.  If you go, do it for yourself, the knowledge you can obtain and the security late in your career it will give you, but dont believe the lie that you will be a desirable candidate or will automatically make more money.  If its money you want by the easiest means possible, my advice, scrape through high school, enjoy your youth, then take a 6 month course to operate heavy machinery and make a killing ($100-300k) in Ft. Mac for 10+ years and retire young.

                     Worked in the sector for a bit, and the foremen of the labour make the big bucks. So unless youre in the top 10% of managing in that company, youre making a good wage, but not anything exceptionally good.

                     Also, if you do break the 100K barrier, its because youre working in Alberta, Fort Mac, Fort St John in northern BC and youre totally isolated and your costs of living are extremely high, lack of housing options, and other pitfalls. Youre probably working overtime and if you deduct from the pay the costs of living, transportation it might not be significant enough a difference to make it worth being totally isolated and in a job that is high risk. Also, the mining sector is incredibly unstable and prone to dips (see 2008 crash where every mine except first-class mines shut down for a period)

                     You can make a bunch of money as a long haul trucker, but do you want to be working 10 hours a day for 3 days every other day and always seated? There are truckers who make over 100K but they are always on the road, showering in truck stops, eating out, and away from social contacts (might be a plus)

                     Good work depends on how you define it, but you have to look above the bottom line, and there are commonalities that need to be there: Stability, reasonable health conditions, and opportunity for growth and mobility.

                     if ur working a job like that youll get hurt or killed because of lack of knowledge. not a good idea without proper training.  which is really easy.. if u dont have the money get talk to welfare or go to MacDonalds save the money and get a trade. u dont have to break ur back. u can drive a dump truck and fix one.  If u wanna make more money it gets dangerous but with that you get more training and learn to deal with those situations.

                     However, in these areas where the natural resources industry is booming and providing big bucks, the price of housing/property and other expenses are skyrocketing, so much of the big money a laborer makes goes right down the drain.  Also, student debts are not a big problem in canada, as it costs maybe a quarter of what it takes to go to school in the states

                     Actually, the reason why the average salary in mining, construction, and oil industries is so high is because either 1) You are an engineer, or 2) Your putting your life at risk on a daily basis. If your not making either one of those, your likely not earning that much in those industries. Stay in school.

                     Yes sure, gambling and robbery can make you rich too. Or you can do some business open some retails. Oh wait? you dont have the money for that? OK, we have some more options, you can invest!! sorry, you dont have the money again. Let me think..humm..how about grab some partners and make a startup company?? ya right, you think you know how to build a career.

                     lmao, you think Real Estate agents are highschool drop out or what? Yes maybe there are some, but most of them are educated at least went to college. You think it requires no skill/professions and can make you good money, why dont we just all go to those jobs and forget about education? I admit there are people can be a great artist/scientist or anything without formal education, but they are talented, not for everyone.

                   There are no careers than earn over 100k that do not require a solid education.  There are jobs, but you need to go way the hell up north and youre being paid a high wage because of that.  Not everybody wants to date a moose, so yes, youre correct.

                     Agreed. They also forget the the only reason they get paid 100K + up north is because 1.) no one wants to be up there 2.) no one wants to do those jobs, and 3.) cost of living there is also ridiculous Make gross of 10K/mo, taxed 3500+, rent for shared room of $2000+. oh and working 80 hour weeks. so basically you net $10-14/hr in your pocket after your expenses be a bus driver in Calgary and you will net the same amount plus you can retire 20 yrs later with full pension.

                       Not even close, John.
                       <br/>
                       I earn well over 100k a year .. Over 40, Dropped out of high school in grade 10 (not proud, but whatever). I live in Edmonton, Im home every night in my own bed, there is no hard labor involved .. And I get to work with and meet great people .. Maybe you should consider being a Hotshot, John?
                       <br/>
                       And as for your Calgary bus driver analogy? Your numbers are whack, sorry. Yes, you see moose up there .. Yes, you might work in isolated locations .. And yes, you might pay $2000 a month, for a room .. If the oil company didnt fly you in, put you up at camp, with satellite, internet, work out facilities, and good food.
                       <br/>
                       Even the ones that do pay, to live in town .. They play hard. Sometimes two and three times a week, maybe more. That gets expensive. Its just living the life. Anyways, they do all that, pay all that .. And still come home after two or three weeks, with that 10k, Not your menial wages. We wouldnt be doing it, otherwise. Dont think so? Where do you think all those beautiful houses, toy haulers, sleds, trucks, bikes, boats, hot rods, and artillery come from?
                       <br/>
                       That $11 an hour were making? The perfect credit rating we all have? Not.
                       <br/>
                       Some of us really do earn good money ..  ..
                       <br/>
                       Then again .. .. Maybe, its just me.

                       I am making 65k (yes much less than you) and other benefit. But I am only graduated from school few month ago and I live in a city. I will cry if I know some high school drop out at my age earn 65k a year. Anyway, I do know one person drop out of high school when he was 18, now he is 23 and make 70k a year, but this guy works harder (not physical labor kind of hard) than everyone I know on this earth, he did not go to college just because he can not afford it and his parents divorced and no one would give him financial care and he got kicked out of home when he turn 19.

                       My 17 year old niece also makes $20.00/hour tutoring.  Its far from full time but with no traditional student jobs available anymore she had to make her own.  My 9 year old earns $8/hr, also tutoring for 4 hours a week.  She is also an avid gardener.  We have several friends in real estate, and she has lined up some summer jobs for her and her 17 year old cousin, also at $20.00/hr landscaping.  Jobs that dont require a high school education, but do require more skills than another kid that age may have, AND the initiative to make our own gardens the envy of the neighbourhood, AND the courage to suggest to our adult friends that the girls could help people that are moving into new homes.  I like the initiative that theyve both taken, but Im glad to know the 17 year old already has her eyes set on a University, and the 9 year old turned something that she loves to do into a pretty good job for a kid her age.  The crappy part of having a young child working is that we dont claim her as a dependent and get a tax credit.  She files her own income tax return.

                       Actually..if youre like my cousin who lives in Edmonton works in Fort Mcmurray and drives his hourly commute everyday to work and back. I think cost of living would go down.

                       after reading all these posts im glad i got into welding and can go north where every one doesnt care what the fuck you dumb fucks think we go to work in crap areas and crap jobs because we love what we do thats why we go north and work long hours. we love what we do we may make lots of money and half to spend a lot of it on expenses but we dont care because we love our jobs we are skilled workers in a very challenging field and people who say welding is easy can come to st thomas ontario and prove it so before you start bad mouthing these jobs that nobody wants try the job and there are lots of people who dont want a trades job but there is just as many that do we love our work and thats all there is to it

                       that only means you wasted your time at school. My education helped me to build my career and I am using what I have learnt from school to make a living.

                       Waste of time for those who care not for what they are doing as long as they are making money. To help one enjoy life they should be doing something they dont hate for 1/2 their waking life, which often needs some level of post secondary schooling. For those who enjoy, or at least put up with things that are not enjoyable for the promise of a paycheck, thats cool. I am a college student but I would say that throughout high school post secondary education was over emphasized. Some arent meant to do any more formal studying, theres a place for them in this great big world too.

                     Wrong, I am living proof and whole heartedly disagree. A Red Seal Tradesman like myself earns a solid 100k gross 40 hrs/week. Dont even need overtime to make it. I live in B.C. and work in competitive a non-union company. All my colleagues are on the same boat. We went to trade school and fulfilled our 5 year aprrenticeship. I would not call that a solid education. It has atouch of acedemics , yes, but not at university degree levels. YOU DO NOT NEED A HIGH EDUCATION DEGREE TO MAKE 6 FIGURES IN CANADA!!! Total BS

                     absolutely right. However, this also depends on what some people might think a solid education entails.  For some, the very definition of education stems from university degrees etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I personally think that a solid education is whatever type of learning youll need to build a solid foundation on whatever it is youre trying to work towards.  After successfully completing the foundations, you blossom from there on.

                     To be honest, I make a little over 100k a year as an auto tech. (i work for myself) I wouldnt be able to achieve project contracts or gain clientele if I were deemed uneducated in my field of work.  So granted, education in this perspective is undeniably quintessential for higher earnings.

                     I am 42 and live in the Windsor area (one of the highest unemployment regions of Canada) and I do make over a $100k a year working 9-5 mon-fri. I had 8 years of good education in a private school in Manitoba but did not even attend high school. I will admit that I feel like a very privileged individual when I see other people with a lot more education then me struggling. I started out working for a small manufacting company (30 employees) from age 18-24 in manufacturing, hands on work making $15-$18 in the early 90s. In 96 at age 24 I got promoted into sales. They paid me $10 per hour plus a sales commission. That first year in sales (1996) I earned $96000. I stayed with this company until 2005. That year the company sold and I switched to selling construction and ag equipment. I had grower up on a farm in MB and always wanted to try this type of sales. My pay dropped into the 50-60 range but I was ready for a change. After 2 years of that in 2007 I was offered a job as a territory sales manager for a company with minimal travel 2-3 weeks a year and $60k salary plus commision. I took that position and am still here at it today and making over a $100k per year.  I have turned down 3 offers in the past 8 years including two of them were big name brand construction equipment companies all offer me sales positions that they gaurentied me over $100k. My company treats me very well so why switch. I do in turn give them my best. I suppose that may be the reason offer companies keep coming to me with the offers the do. Some of them have been my bosses compition. I closing let me add that I did not land not one of these positions because of family or friends connections. I contribute my total success to my first employer, I gave him my I best I could and he pulled me up from there.

                     lmao, self-employed and make millions. Have you tried? hows that going? You think people can just be successful without being professional? Maybe going for education is not the only way to get professionalized but it is a good way. What a opportunist, indeed this world needs more of your kind.

                     Entrepreneurship takes harder work than most jobs. Unless a revolutionary invention/idea just pops into your head and you know all the right people to make it into a successful business, having ones own business is more work, in the majority of situations, than simply working for someone else.

                     Three guarantees in life: death, taxes and uncertainty. Going to school increases your chances of finding relatively stable employment.

                       Stable employment is a bit of a myth in itself. Just because you are working for a company doesnt mean its stable. School is never a bad thing. Any education is never a bad thing, but the idea of that you cant make a stable high earning income without going to traditional university or college, it a complete cultural hoax. Education is what is important to succeed in life not School. There is a difference.

                   School is waste of time as I had been through it twice for two different things. Most employers dont care about your degree, diploma and even less about how bright and sharp you were at school. I am not making 100K but I am very close to making it, and my advice to any one thinking of getting a better salary career is to explore current professions in demand such as various feild in Technology

                   Sales, especially real estate.  I do agree though, overall the longer you stay in school, the higher income you can expect (and rightly should).  The exception seems to be the GAS and Arts degrees.  But people that possess amazing soft skills that you just cant learn in schools make a killing in sales.

                   I quit college and make over a hundred grand, fool. Staying in school simply means you will most likely have a shitload of student loans to pay off, and then when you become a physician (or whatever you believe high earners are), you will probably buy a useless $2 million dollar house to show off, because you never learned the value of money. Now use your effing head. Next?

                   JUST POINT TO ANY UNION JOB.  As long as unions blackmail the public for raises we will see Janitors that earn over 100k/yr.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also earned over 100k running a printing press when I was younger, but technology has made that job mostly extinct.

                   Truckers are unionized a lot so Id them unless you think 2 moinths at a truck school constitutes higher education.

                   Sales jobs. My hubby earns over $200K a year, after just 1 year on the job. Many of his colleagues who do not have degrees make similar amounts so yes, there are options. I also know several others who make over 100K and have not finished school, again in sales.

               I work up in Alberta in the oil patch. Im 21 and make 130k a year. My job is also so easy going, I cant believe the numbers I see on my pay stubs. Also the hours I work a week arent outrageous. You just spend a lot of time away from home. But the time I do get off is more then enough.  Im also only a third level. My superintendent who is 30 years old makes 88 a hour and sits in a chair all day and does what he wants. Dont make assumptions about the oil patch till you have worked there.

                 Yeah I would like to know where you work to make 130k a year at an easy going job?  I do instrumentation in the oil and gas industry and my job is probably the easiest trade labor wise in the industry but you have to go to trade school and it takes 4 years to get your ticket. Guys with a ticket who work on average 50 hours a week make about 150k+ a year and are home almost every night with their family.

               I work up in Alberta in the oil patch. Im 21 and make 130k a year. My job is also so easy going, I cant believe the numbers I see on my pay stubs. Also the hours I work a week arent outrageous. You just spend a lot of time away from home. But the time I do get off is more then enough.  Im also only a third level. My superintendent who is 30 years old makes 88 a hour and sits in a chair all day and does what he wants. Dont make assumptions about the oil patch till you have worked there.

               Im up in albta. Oil patch driving truck making 150k a year before tax and i do nothing all day everyday, But play with my cell phone. I drive 10km a day. Just to park my rig. I dont work for the big oil companys either. So glad i didnt waste my time in school . Especially after seeing those numbers in that add. I also only work 20 days of each month and have 3 weeks off per yr. on top of that. Thing is i didnt even try to get this job and up here in ft. Mac your boss kisses your ass so you dont quit. And if you want you can tell your boss off whenever you want . Its great. Most bosses know better than to fuck with employees anyway.

               I am a woman working up north and I make $140,000 a year
               <br/>
               (and I am on the very low end of the pay scale up here here).  You are correct we work many hours when we are here and are subject to working up north yes but its pretty nice having everything paid for or if you stay at a camp your bed made/room cleaned and food cooked for you every day. No not always is the food amazing but unless you are a gourmet cook I doubt you eat like a champ every night either.  I am away from my friends and family for two weeks which sucks but who isnt every day either?! With the amount of time you all spend commuting and working it actual amounts to what I work plus I get a full week off every 3rd week to do whatever it is I want to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also you dont think a lawyer or doctor or top manager/CEO work 80 hour weeks?!
               <br/>
               Pretty sure no one making over $100,000 is working 40 hour work weeks. Now that
               <br/>
               should be something we are talking about. How can we work 40 hr weeks and make
               <br/>
               $100,000????
              </p>
              <p>
               OH AND PS. I have a Business degree but decided to work up north with all the moose because I am smart (maybe this is the benefit of my very expensive degree???) and didnt want to be paying off student loans making the average salary of most people with degrees and living off my parents or in large amounts of consumer debtthink peoplemoose might not be so bad afterall

                   YTO is absolutely right.  I can vouch by saying that a lot of people I have seen turned away from the industry is because they lack basic communication skills.  For anyone looking to get into the oil industry-Nisku, AB is a hub for a large number of oil companies and a lot of them have offices there also look up Red Deer. AB and Grand Prairie, AB.  Google which companies are there and get applying.  My source? I worked with a recruiter for a large number of major oil companies in Alberta.

               I am a woman working up north and I make $140,000 a year
               <br/>
               (and I am on the very low end of the pay scale up here here).  You are correct we work many hours when we are here and are subject to working up north yes but its pretty nice having everything paid for or if you stay at a camp your bed made/room cleaned and food cooked for you every day. No not always is the food amazing but unless you are a gourmet cook I doubt you eat like a champ every night either.  I am away from my friends and family for two weeks which sucks but who isnt every day either?! With the amount of time you all spend commuting and working it actual amounts to what I work plus I get a full week off every 3rd week to do whatever it is I want to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also you dont think a lawyer or doctor or top manager/CEO work 80 hour weeks?!
               <br/>
               Pretty sure no one making over $100,000 is working 40 hour work weeks. Now that
               <br/>
               should be something we are talking about. How can we work 40 hr weeks and make
               <br/>
               $100,000????
              </p>
              <p>
               OH AND PS. I have a Business degree but decided to work up north with all the moose because I am smart (maybe this is the benefit of my very expensive degree???) and didnt want to be paying off student loans making the average salary of most people with degrees and living off my parents or in large amounts of consumer debtthink peoplemoose might not be so bad afterall

                 Albertas economy sucks, too. Its good for engineers and skilled tradesmen with full journeyman or 3rd/4th year apprenticeships. And of course the usual suspects: doctors, bankers, operations managers, etc. Theres no work out there for most people and the pay blows unless you live in those remote shantytown oil hamlets. I wouldnt go there. The grass is greener on the other sideuntil you walk on it.

               I find it hard to believe these averages when most of the country/province work in jobs that pay less than $20/hour. Think these numbers set people up with false hope.

               I dont care what you say, I went to college when I was 38 I am now seeing the benefits of a good, solid education. I have a great job , bought a house, a new car. You are foolish to think that your future will be secure without an education. Computers are the way to go, they are not going anywhere. Do some research and see yourself what the current wages are.

               Clearly, one does not require a full education nor post secondary education to be financially successful in life.  There are many who have the business sense and recognize and seize opportunities as they make themselves available.  These are entrepreneurs.  There are those who learned a trade or skill then expanded it into a self owned business.  These both can earn well over $100,000/anum.

               However, a good education a secondary school diplomat to a post graduate degree, does not guarantee a good income, especially one in excess of $100,000.
               <br/>
               Ones chances for earning a good income and securing a comfortable life in todays society are drastically increased through a better education, therefore the advise to stay in school is quite valid.  It is sound advise to increase ones chances for a better job, income and quality of life, though not guaranteed.

                 Agree. Finally someone is sane. People think when they get a degree means they can start making money, regardless what they are doing during the 4 years.

                   I graduated with a bachelors in medical science from a well known medical school in southern Ontario. After a year of job hunting, I have yet to find a job which was more than a 3 month contract due to lack of experience. So yeah, education is quite useless in todays job market unless its a professional degree.

               Clearly, one does not require a full education nor post secondary education to be financially successful in life.  There are many who have the business sense and recognize and seize opportunities as they make themselves available.  These are entrepreneurs.  There are those who learned a trade or skill then expanded it into a self owned business.  These both can earn well over $100,000/anum.

               Doesnt matter how much you make unless you are happy  and have a balance between home and work .Staying in school and incuring debt for years while trying to attain a pipe dream job that does not exist for entry level positions is not going to make you happy .You wont be earning high wages at that internship that hasnt paid you in years and that dream job well your grandparents are never gonna let it go because they have been incurring debt for far longer than you have kiddo!

               Its interesting that the article and many of these comments dont discuss the whopping debt that an education entails. I have an above average paying profession but it is cancelled out my massive student loan payments. I love what I do but wish education was more attainable for the average person.

               <br/>
               great career. It is very difficult at the beginning however if you can hang in
               <br/>
               and build up your client base, the rewards in the long term can be amazing.

               I can also say that I work with many successful individuals
               <br/>
               and some have degrees from Universities and some may have diplomas from
               <br/>
               community colleges, however the biggest reason for their success is again hard
               <br/>
               and smart work. If you are like everyone else,,,,,,then you are like everyone

               I think the median salary for people going to school would be higher than the median salary for people not going to school, it is as simple as that; if someone has access to that data I would gladly put this to the test. Sure there will be people that dont go to school and make tons, but they are the exception not the rule. Look at averages and medians, not at a few individuals who come on here and state their salaries, this is a biased representation of the population. I went to school for mathematics and statistics and am making 55k my first year and probably will never touch 150k! but at least I will enjoy what I am doing and maintain a good quality of life. Peoples obsession with money is disgusting. Does everyone think the more money you make the happier you become? sure there is a minimum under which most people would be miserable but people on here are obsessing over 150k +, part of whats wrong with society in my opinion.

               But yeah, you dont need university to make an average or above-average salary while working for a company. Take the typical courier delivery man working at UPS or preloader at Purolator. They all clear 46-58k depending on years of service and hours worked. And few if any have post-secondary education. Good work is where you find it. Education just gets your foot in the door (sometimes), but unlike 30 years ago, the market is saturated with 4-year degrees. They dont carry the same oomph they used to. Experience trumps them every time.

               Well, I make well over $100,000 per year, and work a 37.5 hour work week with no overtime required.  I also make extra money off investments.  But when I was growing up, I ignored the idiots and stayed in school, and then stayed in university.  My job is pleasant and interesting, I actually like it.  SO IMHO, stay in school.

               so to all the people that are saying people are dumb for going to school: what are you doing with your life? school is for some people. SOME. no one said you have to go to post secondary, and no one is saying you have to stay away from it either. in the end its everyones choice what they decide to do So theres no need to verbally abuse someone for their life choices. were all human beings just trying to live and provide in this world. why so much hate?

               so to all the people that are saying people are dumb for going to school: what are you doing with your life? school is for some people. SOME. no one said you have to go to post secondary, and no one is saying you have to stay away from it either. in the end its everyones choice what they decide to do So theres no need to verbally abuse someone for their life choices. were all human beings just trying to live and provide in this world. why so much hate?

               I dropped out of high school half way through grade 10. i went to technical school when i was 24 for 1 year. Now a manager at 33 i make $140,000. my sister went to university for 5 years and has $35,000 of student loans and makes $50,000 a year. There is no need for high school for kids who dont want to be there, get them out working and finding something they want to do.  As for parent who push their kids into university, you are doing them no favours.

               Im a retired teacher. Back in the late 70s and early 80s I had students who sometimes said that their Dads earned more a week than I did with my college degreethat their Dads had only high school degrees or less.  And it was true for a short window of time in history.  Around here, the big draw for high school dropouts or for young men who graduated from high school and for whom technical training and college were not options, the auto industry was just the ticket.   I tried to convince them that eventually this industry would either die down or would change, requiring more technical training.  And, you know whateventually happened.massive cutbacks, big changes in this industry, etc.  But still, a smart kid would survive because he could seek training, more education, if it were financially doable later in his life.  The worst tragedy though was what this industry did to their bodies and spirits.   Ive lived long enough to see itbent and twisted backs, damaged joints, broken hopes and dreams.

               No one needs a university degree in Canada. I got my 4th class stationary engineering ticket in Fort Saskatchewan Alberta. Ive worked for 7 years, I am 29 and now work off-shore for an oil co and I currently have a contract of a years length, worth $115/hour. I work 21 days on 7 days off. Calculate what that is per month boys and gals. Education I am sure is great It would be nice not to work like a work horse. However, I just bought and paid cash for a near half a million dollar home in Northern Ontario where I spend my 1 week per month relaxing and fishing. Life is what you make it, there are opportunities to get rich all over Canada If you do not end up rich by the time you retire in Canada, youve done something seriously wrong with your finances.

               Reading all these comments make me sick, most of you people are so narrow minded and wrapped up in your greedy lives you dont even realize there is so much more in life than just working and saving for two weeks of vacation a year to go to some dirty resort with 3000 other people, you all sound so trapped like its the only lifestyle. Try experiencing things that dont cost massive amounts of moneyExperience what the earth has provided, experience other people, other beliefs, dont slave your healthy years away trying to be what society says you should be.

                 Someones bitter and jealous.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I absolutely love my job. I work 40 hours a week doing what I love. I get amazing benefits and tons of free time. I make 90k/yr (still in my twenties with no education  not oil/gas). Some people chose a high paying career and happened to have a talent for it. The fact that you arent one of these individuals doesnt mean that other people who make good money are narrow minded or greedy, it just means that youre miserable about your current salary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These comments make you sick? Time to take a look at your own life choices, because if you were so content with your life, reading these comments wouldnt make you so upset.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Can you be happy on 30k? Absoloutly!
                 <br/>
                 Can you be unhappy with 120k? Of course!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Youre a loser  not because you dont make tons of money, but because of your bitter condescending attitude.

               omg so many people on here defending their decision to drop out of school or not seek a degree and implying that people who get an education are losers. The author was only stating that the high-paying professions have high educational qualifications, and that if you wanted to be in them you had to stay in school, which is the truth. He wasnt making a value judgement.
              </p>
              <p>
               OK, you want me to play the same game? I stayed in school, got three degrees, and make $650,000 a year in one of those professions. My usual annual pay increase alone is $50,000. There are hundreds of people in my firm with the same qualifications all making the same kind of money. Those who believe they are better off by not having taken the initiative to get a higher education are deluding themselves.

               You seem to be under the illusion people need to like what theyre doing. No one wants to do construction or heavy labor jobs but theyre not exactly complaining because a) they wanted money and b) maybe to them how they get that money doesnt matter as much. Its not glamorous and it doesnt have the chic mental image of suits chatting on cell phones down busy streets, but if youre not swayed by other people envying your lifestyle at a glance, then these are labor jobs are probably a lot better suited to you.

               And ps, I grew up in the you can do anything you want generation. No one bothered to mention that doing anything you want, even if you enjoy it, doesnt earn you money no matter how hard you work at it. Like fine arts or something, or illustration. Yes, you can do it, be the best, go to school, but big money isnt in those industries. You might find less and less people today care about liking their job and are more interested in the jobs that have the most money for the least amount of effort. Because who wouldnt? And why isnt that made clear to kids? Working sucks, in every field, just go into something high paying and made for the lazy.

               Staying in school will def lead you to more secure jobs and more opportunities. But in general all the multi millionaires I know, and I know quite a few, most of them didnt go to college or were drop outs in school, and now are in the top earner percentage from becoming entrepreneurs.

               I believe that the best opportunity to make over $100K per year without spending years and years in school is in a sales profession. Sales does require brains and hard work, but not necessarily a degree in any specific major or industry. You just have to be good with people, honest and persistentall traits that arent school based but can be honed through life experience and inherently learned values. I did happen to graduate college and earn close to $150K per year in sales, but I know just as many people in my industry that dont have a degree and make over $100K per year. But, everyone is right, there is not job out there where you can make $100K without hard work and sacrifice.

                 yes but being good with people, honest and persistent is probably something you have learned form your parents in your family values for almost 20 years, thats longer then any university

               Canadians make more than US but taxes in Canada are truly high. Disposable incomes hinder economic expansion. Canadian wage earners are doomed until the leaders in this country reverse their archaic policy and start by releasing more income in the hands of Canadians to spend.

               Reports suck  The immigrants are facing hell lot of hardships. I came to know from previous records that canada encourages immigrants to fulfill their labour market, that is working in industries , and low paid jobs which Canadians think twice to do it. Normally education in every country should be recognized and validated, but in Canada the validation helps to continue further education and not the job.so ultimately a doctor or an engineer from other countries is ends up with labour jobs thats what this nice country gives.

               Reports suck  The immigrants are facing hell lot of hardships. I came to know from previous records that canada encourages immigrants to fulfill their labour market, that is working in industries , and low paid jobs which Canadians think twice to do it. Normally education in every country should be recognized and validated, but in Canada the validation helps to continue further education and not the job.so ultimately a doctor or an engineer from other countries is ends up with labour jobs thats what this nice country gives.

               Those are average salaries. More importantly what is the median salary? The median salary is where half the population make more and half make less. The number is no doubt lower. Take 11 people. 6 of them make $25,000/year. 1 makes $1,000,000, 1 $500,000, 1 $250,000, 1 $100,000 and 1 $75,000. The average is $188,636 but the median is $25,000. Quite a difference. I know simplistic but that is the difference between median and average.

               too much education can be a drag and a downer: a) too much school debt, b) too many years wasted learning things you will never use and then c) you cant get a job b/c there are no jobs in your field of PhD Philosophy LOL lets face it nowadays if you want to be employed and make good money you have to start off with good street smarts  look around you, do some research, see where the job market is going  for example most young people are very good with technology, computers, mobile devices etc  you do a 2-3 year local IT college, heck even a bachelor of science or computer science just for street cred, work for 3-5 years where ever you can score a gig to get really good at what you do and put some ish on your resume and then go straight into consulting  IT consultants can easily bring well over $100k and it aint grease work I can tell you that much

               Hello buddy,
               <br/>
               I have been here only for three years and almost 40 and according to u if I spend another 10 yrs to establish myself , I can and I will do good in life. But u and I will lose all the real and best life to enjoy with family goes garbage. Earning money for the children is not the goal in life. Living ur life is the goal.
               <br/>
               And most important think is I did not speak for myself and I did speak for the most number of immigrants.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am settling here with a pharmacist designation after 6 years. But I convey the msg how this country treats u with partiality.

               This high school drop out has been in mining for 27 years now and work 77 hrs a week then get one week off.  They fly me to and from the site in an executive aircraft feed me and house me and pay me 150k plus every year. Life is good I am healthy having worked physically hard most of those years.  My educated friends are still paying off their mortgage and in dept.  I owe no one nothing and will retire with 1m in the next 3-4 years. I would rather my kids get an education but that will be their choice.  hard decision for them having being spoiled from my high income.  BLA BLA BLA

               Many companies wont hire  you into professional roles unless you have a university degree.  Having the degree is a way to show your intelligence and ability to stick with your program.  Non-professional roles may pay a lot if you put in lots of hours of work and often they include heavy physical labor which is OK when youre in your 20s, but can you keep up the pace into your 50s and 60s?  And do you want to keep working outside in the freezing Alberta winters like some of these jobs require?

               Not everyone can make it up to the top of Everest and those who do, need sherpas, so there is room for every level of ability and education.  Im just glad my parents ensured I had the right high school courses to give me the option of going to university (which I did).  Several of my friends went back to upgrade after high school because they saw many more opportunities when you had a degree.  If you dont want a degree, trade school is a great option.

               Many companies wont hire  you into professional roles unless you have a university degree.  Having the degree is a way to show your intelligence and ability to stick with your program.  Non-professional roles may pay a lot if you put in lots of hours of work and often they include heavy physical labor which is OK when youre in your 20s, but can you keep up the pace into your 50s and 60s?  And do you want to keep working outside in the freezing Alberta winters like some of these jobs require?

               Not everyone can make it up to the top of Everest and those who do, need sherpas, so there is room for every level of ability and education.  Im just glad my parents ensured I had the right high school courses to give me the option of going to university (which I did).  Several of my friends went back to upgrade after high school because they saw many more opportunities when you had a degree.  If you dont want a degree, trade school is a great option.

               I would rather spend 8 of my younger years studying hard to become a dentist and have my life set than living my life just to work hard in extreme conditions in the patch just for that extra buck  just sayin.
               <br/>
               Doesnt matter though.  To get ahead, its either the choice of working hard mentally or working hard physically.

               Ive taken post-secondary for 6 years, for my undergrad and masters and am now making ~400k a year at my own firm. The only reason I could do this was because I knew more than others. When it comes down to it, school and learning merely empowers you. What you do with the knowledge you obtained is what matters. Honestly, the opinions regarding education is unimportant, because its not just about going to school per se; but rather what you do with your time spent in school.
