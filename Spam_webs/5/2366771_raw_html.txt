   <p>
    Hello John:
   </p>
   <p>
    Thanks for the good letter. I don't think it hurts, sometimes, to remember where
you came from. You know the places where I came from. Even the people who try
to write about that or make films about it, they don't get it right. They call it "9 to 5."
It's never 9 to 5, there's no free lunch break at those places, in fact, at many of them
in order to keep your job you don't take lunch. Then there's OVERTIME and the
books never seem to get the overtime right and if you complain about
    <i>
     that
    </i>
    , there's
another sucker to take your place.
   </p>
   <p>
    You know my old saying, "Slavery was never abolished, it was only extended to
include all the colors."
   </p>
   <p>
    And what hurts is the steadily diminishing humanity of those fighting to hold jobs
they don't want but fear the alternative worse. People simply empty out. They are
bodies with fearful and obedient minds. The color leaves the eye. The voice becomes
ugly. And the body. The hair. The fingernails. The shoes. Everything does.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a young man I could not believe that people could give their lives over to those
conditions. As an old man, I still can't believe it. What do they do it for? Sex? TV?
An automobile on monthly payments? Or children? Children who are just going to
do the same things that they did?
   </p>
   <p>
    Early on, when I was quite young and going from job to job I was foolish
enough to sometimes speak to my fellow workers:  "Hey, the boss can come
in here at any moment and lay all of us off, just like that, don't you
realize that?"
   </p>
   <p>
    They would just look at me. I was posing something that
they didn't want to enter their minds.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now in industry, there are vast layoffs (steel mills dead, technical
changes in other factors of the work place). They are layed off by the
hundreds of thousands and their faces are stunned:
   </p>
   <p>
    "I put in 35 years . . . "
   </p>
   <p>
    "It ain't right . . . "
   </p>
   <p>
    "I don't know what to do . . . "
   </p>
   <p>
    They never pay the slaves enough so they can get free, just enough so they
can stay alive and come back to work. I could see all this. Why couldn't
they? I figured the park bench was just as good or being a barfly was just
as good. Why not get there
    <i>
     first
    </i>
    before they put me there? Why
wait?
   </p>
   <p>
    I just wrote in disgust against it all, it was a relief to get the shit
out of my system.  And now that I'm here, a so-called professional writer,
after giving the first 50 years away, I've found out that there are
    <i>
     other
    </i>
    disgusts beyond the system. . .
   </p>
   <p>
    I remember once, working as a packer in this lighting fixture company, one of the
packers suddenly said: "I'll never be free!"
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the bosses was walking by (his name was Morrie) and he let out this
delicious cackle of a laugh, enjoying the fact that this fellow was
trapped for life.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, the luck I finally had in getting out of those
places, no matter how long it took,
    <i>
     has
    </i>
    given me a kind of joy, the
jolly joy of the miracle. I now write from an old mind and an old body,
long beyond the time when most men would ever think of continuing such a
thing, but since I started so late I owe it to myself to continue, and
when the words begin to falter and I must be helped up stairways and I can
no longer tell a bluebird from a paperclip, I still feel that something in
me is going to remember (no matter how far I'm gone) how I've come through
the murder and the mess and the moil, to at least a generous way to
die.
   </p>
   <p>
    To not to have entirely wasted one's life seems to be a worthy
accomplishment, if only for myself.

  <blockquote>
   4/17/92 12:15 AM
   <p>
    Hello Wm Packard:
   </p>
   <p>
    Huh. Listen, I know that you can never print all the accepted poems on
your backlog. First, it would freak all the good souls of the universe.
And, second, there are other writers. Huh.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yet, I can't resist, in
spite of knowing all this, sending you a shit-balloon poem that might
explode into the multi-faced reign of ultimate godliness. Huh. Huh,
huh?
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, some concern on "dumb night", for such a poem is considered
anti-social enlightenment . . . such as a drunk vapid woman? Impossible
and unfair. There are no longer any drunken sluts. There are only stupid,
mean white men. There are no vicious homosexuals or lesbians or
bisexuals. And there are no longer any stupid, mean black men. Although
there might be some stupid, mean yellow men or brown men, depending upon
the political climate and the local of the moment. Each only deserves
attack and derision in direct relationship to any force they might apply
to our survival. Most successful commercial writers know what to attack
and when. And even the Artsy-Fartsies who are touched upon with the Nobel
and Pulitzer prizes, they too are screened for any dangerous signals of
individuality. But how about . . . ? you say. How about them? They too
sucked to the signal of the moment, the edict, the on-coming demand of
thought control. They were only the forerunners of the obvious.
   </p>
   <p>
    But
getting back to small matters, it has always been curious to me that my
writing has been attacked for portraying others as I have seen them, but
my writing has never been criticized when I ended up as the jacknape. This
could be art, they say, he is calling himself a fucking fool. They like
that, it takes the heat off of their frightened asses.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are living in a terrible climate now. Everybody is waiting to be
insulted. I think that I believe more than almost anybody in the right to
be whatever you want to be. In fact, I have probably worked more directly
from that premise than most and have en ded up in any number of hells for
doing so. But I did this from a singular stance, most alone, and not
buddied up by a jolly group in safe chorus.
   </p>
   <p>
    So often now, it is not so much a group demanding their rights as it is a
group wanting more than their rights, it is almost a tribal on-surging,
subconsciously or perhaps even consciously wanting to be top dog and screw
all else. Also, there are those within each group who are simply
psychotics who want to be seen and heard in parades or any other damned
place or time.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a writer, one must write what one sees and feels regardless of the
consequences. In fact, the more the consequences the more one is goaded
into going for it. Some call it madness, I call it near-truth. You know,
there is nothing more entertaining, funnier than near-truth because you
see it, read it so seldom. It hits you with a refreshing blast, it runs up
the arms, into the head, it gets giddy, god damn, god damn, so rare, so
lovely. I saw some of it in Celine, in Dostoevsky, in Hamsun, I started
laughing as I read them, it was such a joy
   </p>
   <p>
    In our age, the only safe target for the writer is the white heterosexual
male. You can make him a murderer, a child-rapist, a motherfucker. Nobody
protests. Not even the white heterosexual male. He's used to it. Also,
things like "White men can't dance,"  "White men can't jump," "White men
have no sense of rhythm", etc.. What is happening here might be a
near-truth, still it is mostly mouthed by white women and promoted by
white men in the media. Am I racist? Tell me, how many non-whites have you
had in your home or in your room lately?
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, we go on and on. Probably a certain psychosis working here. I hope
so. It seems to give one an edge in the working place. Still the poem
"dumb night' got me to thinking about this and about the reaction you'd
get if you published it. Yet, many of us have had nights like this one. 
It's just a place within a place, something that explodes into the air,
and for all its grossness there is a certain demented glamour of two
people trapped together in a world that has never worked for them and
never will. There is no insult to man or woman intended but if there is
some insult there, then fine, it belongs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, I'm drinking, have been or wouldn't have gone on so long. Basically,
only want to say that at this time it is tough for the writer who wants to
put it down as it is, or was. The 90's have far more strictures than the
50's ever had. We've gone back, not so much in how we think but in what we
can say. Each Age has borne its own contriticions [?contradictions] but
the end of the 20th century is a particularly sad one. We've lost our
guts, our gamble, our heart. Listen, believe me, when we say it and say it
true, the women will love it, the blacks, the browns, the yellows, the
greens, the reds and the purples will love it, and the homosexuals and the
lesbians and all the in between will love it. Let's not crap ourselves, we
are different but we are one.  We bring death to each other and death
brings it to us. Did you ever see that flattened cat on the freeway as you
drove by at 70 m.p.h.? That's us, baby. And I scream to the skies that
there should be no way, no word, no limit. Just a roll of the dice, the
tilting of the dark white light and the ability to laugh, a few times, at
what has trapped us like this.
