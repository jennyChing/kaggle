          What are the benefits of dental implants?

         For those looking to replace missing teeth from their mouth, they have a number of viable options.  First, if the adjacent teeth are in decent shape, a dentist can fix up a bridge and crown in order to replace the empty space where the tooth once was.  Dentures, either full or partial, are also an option, but many individuals do not like to care for and deal with dentures on a daily basis when it comes to cleaning, care, removal and insertion.  They may also find that dentures do not fit well and are uncomfortable, especially those dealing with full sets on the top or bottom of their mouth.

         <br/>
         Dental implants are an option that many individuals consider when they are looking to find a more permanent solution to their missing teeth.  Dental implants are essentially titanium rods that are placed into the gums, which act as the "roots" of your new teeth.  They end up being seated well into the jaw bone, making them strong and sturdy, just like a real tooth.  A full crown is placed on top of the implant, and you will not only have a tooth that looks natural, but will act as a natural tooth as well.

         There are a number of benefits when it comes to getting a dental implant over other cosmetic procedures.  Patients find that dentures are a more temporary solution, and find that caring for them and removing and inserting them daily is an inconvenience.  They may also not care for how they fit onto their gums, either.  Bridges require work on the surrounding teeth, which can affect their strength and integrity.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         For someone looking for a permanent, more natural solution, dental implants have a number of benefits for patients.  With proper care, they have an extremely long lifespan and a high success rate overall.
