             Sometimes, artists remove things theyve created and cut content for a variety of reasons. Most of the times, this is creative expression working as it should. Very rarely is it actually censorship.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, everything looks like censorship when you believe creative expression applies ONLY to the production of content, when it can just as easily refer to the altering  and even removal  of it.

                 Not completely sure Id want to see him commit seppuku after that traumatic experience. Wouldnt mind a play through of a current scary game though, too bad they dont actually exist.

               Please dont use Bioware and ME3 as an example of this. We did not have an issue with the ending but rather with the ending was not what was promised to us.

                 Exactly. The fuss about the ending wasnt just that it was shit (I guess in the end BioWare would have been criticised for the ending regardless of how they did it), but about their broken promises.
                 <br/>
                 The simple fact that they never rectified that and instead managed to make the complaining crowd go silent with a DLC that further cemented their broken promises is still mind boggling to me.

                 Thank you for this!  The way you know that people were actually mad for good reasons and not just because the ending was bad is that people stopped the ruckus after they gave us the new ending.  Its still actually really bad, but it lives up to the promises.  Personally, when I finished ME3, I thought the ending was really bad, but I wasnt mad about it.  Then my friend finished it about 2 hours later, and he looked up the YouTube video comparing all three endings and sent it to me.  Thats when I got mad, because they promised our choices would matter and then gave us identical endings, making all of the choices meaningless.

                 I agree, although Im not really sure how many people are(were) Mass Effect fans AND Batgirl OR DMC fans.

                 Either way, ME3 was the best thing to ever happen to me as a gamer. I just stopped caring. I didnt feel the compulsive need to replay Dragon Age 2 when starting on DAI, I bought it during a holiday sale, and most importantly it wasnt great but I enjoyed it! I felt freedom for the first time in my life, and I have Casey Hudson to thank for it.

                 I think the point in this context was that it was ultimately in Biowares hands what they did and just the act of outside influences telling Bioware that they wanted something different does not mean Bioware has stripped of their own agency to decide what it wants to do. Say what you will about the endings, both sets or about Bioware but they were pretty clear from the start (and arguably before the game was even out) that they wanted to work with everyone to shape this story. Its actually an excellent example to bring up and one that I would have had the video not addressed first because someone was going to bring it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Its unfortunate that this video even has to be made but it is the climate. The idea that any thought influenced by an outside element isnt a genuine one. Its like people dont know how brains work or something.

                 Its funny, actually  for a guy whose show is maybe half the time him complaining about things game companies do, he sure is quick to be casually dismissive of other people who complain about things game companies do, to the point where he wont bother to actually find out why. I mean, I get that this is the Internet and being able to express ones gripes in anything more articulate than wharrgarbling is a talent given only to the Privileged Few, but within the literally years its been since that kerfuffle, youd think

                   I have no idea why youre reading dismissiveness into this. I have actually admitted my initial dismissive attitude toward those people upset by the ME3 ending was wrong, so your smarmy little comment is pretty off-base.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I used ME3 as an example because, regardless of what was promised, BioWare still produced the content they content, and people wanted it to change for some reason. And like I said, if BioWare had caved to pressure and totally changed that ending, I wouldnt have had a problem with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As much as I admitted fault in the ME3 thing, by fucking God are some of you still super friggin raw about it.

               Hey Jim,
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for providing some context on the Batgirl cover; I havent been following it closely, but apparently from the controversy my reaction of Batgirls been captured, and Jokers not in a mood to play wasnt an especially common one.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do hope with all of my being that this whole entitlement/exaggeration messThe worst possible connotation is the one that is true, Everyone should be offended by what offends me, every product should cater to my exact whims, there is no compromise, regret, revisions, or anything of the sort, only Zuul.err, censorship, etc, as well as the whole redefining words by using them wrongly thing, are products of immaturity mixed with contact and information overload, born of the world having its first generation of young adults to have a prevalent web their entire lives.

                 I become extremely confused whenever I see people blame the millennials for this stuff. Ive seen no evidence that its just young people making these mistakes. My circle of friends has generally applauded changes of this sort, and most of us are around twenty. My parents get far more upset about finding out that somethings been edited than I or my sister do, and my sister is 17. Yeah, obviously there
                 <i>
                  are
                 </i>
                 millenials making these mistakes, but theyre certainly not
                 <i>
                  exclusive
                 </i>
                 to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As for redefining words by using them wrongly, thats, uh. Sort of how the evolution of language works. English would not exist if it werent for corruptions and slang. Its not worth complaining over.
                 <br/>
                 (Case and point: you used wrongly incorrectly within that sentence, and I still understood what you meant. I wouldnt even be bringing it up in an ordinary situation. Again: not worth complaining over.)

                   Evolution of language is a pretty tenuous argument when were talking about the difference between to morrow -&gt; tomorrow and Censorship = suppression of expression by a third party acting in an official capacity -&gt; Censorship = voluntary revision for quality / context.

                   Im also not blaming young people specifically, but rather the culture in which the young are now expected to come of age.  [By the way, were into a new, as-of-yet unnamed generation at this point; Milennial is those who came of age in close proximity to the new milennium25-35 year olds, and arguably even then it should be split into two due to the massive upheavals in the world in the early 90sbut at this point is being used to describe over 30 years worth of offspring].

                   Information is now more freely available than its ever beenas is misinformation.  From your self-admitted age, ubiquitous internet has been around your entire life, and as someone old enough to vividly remember the before-times, its a completely different world than it was.  I can only imagine how difficult it must be to become a well-adjusted adult in a world where any crackpot can find an echo chamber and add their disinformation to the overwhelming deluge of information already out there.  Not unlike trying to drink the oceanwhere do you start?  Who do you believe?  And without the steady hand of a mentor, how do you find the boundaries of behavior?

                     Shit; Im sorry. I dont know why I jumped to the conclusion that you were talking about terms like literally and like; I guess Im too used to the YouTube comments section. Youre all too reasonable, here! =P

                    <p>
                     And yeah, the internet is a big place. I had the benefit of an education from teachers who knew how to teach their students how to find things reliably on the internet, and how to check ones source, but I imagine there are a lot of people who werent that fortunate. I kind of wish that services like Google Scholar and JSTOR werent monetized, but theres not really much I can do about that, I suppose.

               Eh, it was alright. Half-expected a rickroll or a screamer at the end with that editing joke.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for DmC(which Ive recently obtained a copy of the PC version), yeah I stand by what I said about such lunacy being a vocal minority. Its one line, not a particularly good one. Though I disagree with Jim thats its in the same tone as the other games. Its watered down, not insane enough (if that makes sense to anybody). It rides that ugly line of being semi-serious. Its not silly enough where you just nod your head and say okay, nor is it serious enough that you gain a proper emotional connection to whats happening.
               <br/>
               Mixing in a plotline about an evil soft drink that makes people dumb with a scene where Virgil talks about his mother being murdered via ripping out her heart(which it explicitly shows) just doesnt work. If that isnt an uneven tone then I dont know what is.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the case of the Batgirl cover, how could it have been censored if the image is readily available? Sure its not on the cover of the comic but you could just glue stick a print out on one. It was a variant cover anyway which means it was pointless to begin with(as variant covers usually are except to the most fanatical). Thinking about it, they could really make fun of this if they do a similar cover with Superman and a creepy female Braniac. With tentacles. That would be hilarious.
              </p>
              <p>
               This post was censored several times.

               I had no issue with the cover. I thought it was a powerful, disturbing homage to a VERY disturbing entry in the Batgirl story. But if one of the co-authors of THE ACTUAL COMIC thinks the art isnt right for the comic, then who am I to argue?

                 The problem was that the cover was referencing a storyline that had never happened in the current continuity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The cover is totally fine for a story where the batgirl involved was actually shot by the joker  but a cover for the current series of batgirl? It didnt fit. Out of context, that cover is really quite good  but in context, its confusing.

                   Actually I think technically the Killing Joke is still in continuity, Babs just got better and became Batgirl again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The issue, as far as I understand it, was more about how the cover didnt gel with the current tone of the series, which is a lot more upbeat and focused on strong female characters whereas the Killing Joke is a particularly dark tale which used abusing the only female character in that entire story as a way to make one of the male characters angry (dont get me wrong, its a fantastic book and one of the greatest Batman stories ever, but I can see why certain amongst the comic-reading crowd arent keen on it).

                       Yes and no. Some titles were pretty much totally reset, but others still have a lot of pre-52 material as being canon at least in broad strokes. Batman has a lot of material still considered canon, just in a more compressed time scale. The Killing Joke still happened, but Barbara had a chip implanted in her brain so she could walk again.

               The ending pretty much nails it. Free Speech is defined solely as speech that caters to me, and anything that doesnt actively offend people I dont like is being Censored regardless of why that decision was made.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its the same logic that conspiracy theorists use: Anything that doesnt bend over backwards to align itself with my beliefs is part of a vast orchestrated conspiracy to destroy me.

               I with you jim, editing and censoring are in no way the same. Every time  gaming gets  into one of these scrapes I think about how ridiculous it would be if we thought of films in the same mind-numbing black and white terms. Take Blade Runner for example: WB didnt like Scotts original take, so added a VO. (which everyone, Scott included, hated) were WB censoring Scott? No.  When Scott eventually had the VO removed, was he censoring WB? Of course not.
              </p>
              <p>
               There five different versions of Blade Runner, Riddly Scott was not censoring himself every time he went back to it.

              </p>
              <p>
               Im as tired as anyone of people trying to use loaded language to win arguments on the Internet. Censorship is kind of a case in point; who wants to be the guy for censorship?
              </p>
              <p>
               But at the same time, saying that what were seeing here is editing, just like so many works have been edited over the years, (nothing has changed here, nothing to see here, move along) doesnt ring true.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not that long ago, when you talked about editing the draft of a book, or the footage of a television show, or revising a painting, you were talking about feedback-reaction loop with a very narrow audience. The author gave their work to their editor, or a select reading group. The director gave the show footage to the editing team. The artists patron asked for a warmer color palette, or whatever.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, works like the Batgirl cover are exposed to an enormous audience before the product theyre supposed to adorn even comes out, and DmC has been seen by millions of people before we get a definitive edition. Rather than being only subject to a specifically qualified or invested party or parties, the works are exposed for most of the world to see. The relationship between the audience and the artist has changed significantly in the age of Twitter. Sometimes for the better, but not always. (As for that cover, Im still very much ambivalent, not that it apparently matters  very much any more.)
              </p>
              <p>
               If were going to take this as a black-and-white issue- which I think is very much a mistake- arent we equally obliged to pretend that the screw-ups of once great developers now under the heel of EA arent the result of corporate meddling, because the terrified souls put in the interview spotlight will inevitably tell us so? No, of course there was no pressure! My decision to make the title, I mean franchise, that I created into a freemium mobile offering was entirely an artistic decision!
              </p>
              <p>
               Just editing, yknow.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its the cover artists decision to retract that cover, sure. And maybe he decided that the image wasnt conveying what he had hoped it would, based on that feedback, or maybe he just decided that it wasnt worth anyone threatening to kill people over. And maybe the DC brass really didnt opine on what he should do, one way or another.
              </p>
              <p>
               Still, if its not censorship, can we at least recognize that its still a long leap away from that artist making the decision to change it in a closed room with the rest of the creative and editing team, as we might have once described editing? Because otherwise, I dont think were telling a very honest story.

                 A thoughtful response, but I think you are still a bit caught up.

                 The batgirl cover was a throwback. A reminiscence of a by-gone era in comics. One batgirl was almost killed by the Joker, had her spine destroyed by a bullet and was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her existence. Post-new 52, its not the same batgirl. The joker freaks everyone out  he should  but she would not have the historical fear of the Joker from that experience which the cover invokes. It was anachronistic. I saw the cover, was not offended in any way, but was pretty confused.

                 EA leaning on a studio to do what they want with an upcoming product is a clash of creative direction and business goals. This is NO WAY relates to the concepts of censorship. Thats corporate interference with the creation of art. Microsoft and Blue just showed recently what happens when a large publisher lets a little indie studio do its thing. EA might learn some lessons and notice that REALLY good games with amazing revenue potential can come from allowing artistic freedom, but thats a very different issue and a jimquisition that has existed and will likely exist again.

                 The editing a line from DmC what was, in my opinion, unnecessary but understandable. It was a crappy line of dialogue that offered nothing beyond what had already been said and simply served to waste time  the country is your bitch, we get the connotations, move on. Did they bend to external forces about that line?  I dont really think so. It was tame in the grand scheme of things  I cant think of a particularly good incentive to change it outside of actual pacing. Something that revisiting the product allowed to occur.

                 The point you make that I do feel is fair though is that this isnt a black and white issue. Its not Artistic editing here and censorship or bowing to external market forces over there. There is a massive range of greys inbetween. We do occasionally see concession. A change made to appease some that has little impact on the product as a whole. You could consider this consumer-encouraged editing if you wish. Public feedback that allows a creator to see their work through a different light and come to agree with the generally expressed consensus. But how do you determine where listening to feedback is artistic editing or politically-correct adjustments. . in a creative industry, we have to accept that we will never know all the elements of a decision, but we can decide which creators we genuinely trust to remain truthful to their creations.

                   SANLUMIERE- If it wasnt clear, the connection I draw with EA is the assumption that when an artist withdraws the cover, they did it without coercion on the part of DC, but when someone with an EA-headed developer like Maxis or Visceral falls on the sword for an unpopular decision in a recent title, EA is still the culprit. This allows those who are so inclined to believe the narrative that the former is [positive] artistic choice, the latter is [negative] meddling And quite possibly because we agree or disagree with the outcome. Its certainly arguable than in neither case is it censorship, though I grow increasingly weary of the notion that something not fitting into a tight definition of censorship is all that is necessary for repression of images or ideas to be okay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In this particular instance, someone like me has a observed a long pattern of bad behavior from EA, and is perfectly willing to believe the notion that, whatever a sub-developer might say, EA policy lurks in the shadows of bad decisions when nickels and dimes are on the line. Whereas with DC, I admit a more neutral stance, partly born of ignorance. What I know of DC is that theyve been around a long time, that they recently rebooted their universe, and that theyd really, really like to be where Marvel is as far as a cinematic version of their universe goes. Are they giving their artists enough slack to make decisions like withdrawing the alternate Batgirl cover without any pressure or interference? I dont know- but I sort of have to give a journalist who says thats whats happened the benefit of the doubt, even if thats a leap of faith.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But we need to be careful in such cases; its perilously easy to apply a double standard, believing one line out of hand and discarding the other equally out of hand because it suits the narrative we choose to believe.

                 One of the big problems here is the way DC mandates these kinds of things. The creative team of Batgirl learned of the alternate cover at the same time the rest of the world did, leaving them no time to debate the issue in private.
                </p>
                <p>
                 DC Comics, as long-time comic fans are well-aware of, are essentially idiots when it comes to creative integrity these days. The list of creators who have walked away not only from their titles but from the company since the Nu52 launched is pretty long and NDAs are becoming commonplace to prevent creators from revealing just how much editorial interference is taking place behind the scenes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So for long-time DC watchers, that the desire for a quick buck off an alternate cover was put aside for the creative integrity of the Batgirl creative team is actually a very welcoming sign after years of expecting the absolute worst from the company.

                 There seems to be a factual error here. The ORIGINAL cover wasnt the bad one. The artist was fine with that. DC then had the artist make a new more creepy cover. That second cover was the one that was pulled. So if your (wrong) definition of censorship would include a work that replaces an artists previous work then its the victim Batgirl cover that is an act of censorship.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is a particular problem because, as another poster noted, many people on the web are effectively conspiracy theorists  right-wing conspiracy theorists, to be particular. Outside of video games, right-wing conspiracy theorists occupy their time by blaming Jews or blacks for everything, but within video games, its women. Legions of women, coming for your games (coming for your guns, for your (presumably other) women, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                 So whats the response of these persons in the face of the above fact? No change to their position at all. They just invent a reality where evil feminists are somehow all to blame again. There s nothing anyone can do about that. We can, however, prevent this perverse viewpoint from warping our language. I dont want the term censorship to go the way of the term entitlement: a meaningless boogeyman invoked by the politically dishonest.

                   Variant covers, by definition, dont eliminate the originals. They co-exist with them, often in smaller print numbers.

                   Please be careful not to assume all the sins of the world co-exist within those who disagree with you. Doing so isnt all that different from labelling someone an SJW; its an excuse not to hear someone out, an assumption that not just the argument but the person making it is without worth.

                     The cover [i]supercedes[/i] the concept art of the original cover. Whether or not alternative covers are printed is completely irrelevant.

                     I do think theres a bit of projection here. I made no assumptions in the previous posts, but the notion that an irrelevant argument is, in fact, relevant, for assumed reasons is an assumption. I understand that some might find this issue charged, but thats no reason to project ones misapprehensions onto another.

                       Actually, the burden of proof is on you to show that the alternate status even matters. You cite it as if it supports or negates a claim at issue, when it does not. The issue is that the newest cover negated the entire premise of the comic, as per the comics creators and artists, and said cover was ordered by the publisher, not the creators. Please explain why this negation would be ameliorated or enhanced by the covers alternate status: I cannot understand why that would matter. A customer would see the cover, note that the cover undermines the comics theme and characters, and the comic (and the brand) would be hurt. How does its alternate status affect that?

               As someone who has, professionally, worked in video editing  though only recently have I turned that to producing game-related videos  I can say that this episode of Jimquisition does encapsulate the real difference. Removing content often improves the product, and does not in anyway change the message, intent or core values of that content or its author.
              </p>
              <p>
               I watch with a critical eye what Jim, and other reviewers do with their video content. For example, and I dont usually point these out, but near the end of the video, the word work was repeated multiple times and become conspicuous by this repetition. If I were Jim, during the outloud readthroughs and subsequent audio recording, I probably would have noticed the word work showing up a few times in a row and perhaps adjusted that. If Jim DID notice the repetition and left it, that was actually a content decision on his part. It certainly served to provide emphasis on the passage he was saying at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
               TotalBiscuit, as much as I like his work, could do with some more aggressive editing in his work. He tends to drift, lives in a pretty unscripted world and therefore can feel very meandering and a bit repetitive in his WTF videos for example. Thats his style, I dont find it annoying, but professionally, it is always what I am thinking about when I watch his stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
               The internet perception of free speech is a bit distorted. Actually the internet perception of everything is a bit distorted, but free speech, censorship, and the presumption of person rights are among the most twisted.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, many internet people would come to jimquisition, post horrifyingly mean posts about Jim personally  a full on attack. Jim may leave it alone, finding it entertaining that someone is so determined to attack him so. Or, he could remove their posts  a) because why leave them. b) because it will invariably incite others to either pile on, or provide some defense, and the comments become nothing but back and forth attacks which are no longer related to the content.
              </p>
              <p>
               By removing the content, he would be accused of limiting the posters right to free speech. But, there is really nowhere but a personal blog on the internet, owned by you, where free speech is really protected. Every other place you post content is at the permission of the site owner  the free speech you may feel you have there is an illusion provided by a consenting host.
              </p>
              <p>
               He might also be accused of censorship  again, you could certainly make that case  but it falls a little short of meeting the those requirements. A site owner can have any number of rules, public or otherwise, that would lead to your comment being removed.
              </p>
              <p>
               The internet feels they are entitled, and this extends to the products or issues about which they are passionate, or somehow peripherally involved with. And the default defense of these entitlements is to leap behind misinterpretations of personal rights.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your right is to like, or dislike. To agree or disagree. Going beyond that, as a consumer, is to build a fallacy.

               Dear Jim,
               <br/>
               As a long time listener of your work I request that you  sneak in more Willem Dafoe content into your current works. I enjoyed the brief segment at the end of the video as it reminded me of the golden era of you and Jonathan Holmes talking absolute gobbledygook and indirectly making me urinate with laughter as a result.
              </p>
              <p>
               Best regard,
               <br/>
               Dr. Phil Fling

               Its not hard to doubt the conviction of the majority of the people screaming censorship as you find so many of them trying to bend Marvel to their will on the subject of Thor, who must be freed from the evil grip of SJWs before its too late.
              </p>
              <p>
               But for anyone who knows the history of comics, youll find many, many, many examples of DC and Marvel pulling the rug out from under their creators feet. Jim Shooter was famous for it during the 80s at Marvel, most notably in the Dark Phoenix Saga where he over-ruled Chris Claremont and John Byrne and declared that Jean Grey must be punished for the genocide she had committed during the story, a move which all credit toward making the story the classic that it was. John Byrne would be on the receiving end of a few more of these dictates, often leading to him quitting the title as his previously approved plans were rejected at the last moment by Shooter.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over at DC, Alan Moore brought a more mature perspective to their line which created a different kind of problem, the possibility their stories might offend someone. The first casualty was Rick Vietch whose Swamp Thing was set to feature Jesus, portrayed as a white magician. Solicited but never released, DC panicked at the last moment lead to Vietch resigning from the title and scuttling tentative plans for Neil Gaiman to take over the title at the planned end of his run. Warren Ellis would run afoul of Columbine sensitivity when his solicited story about school shootings for Hellblazer was pulled for fear of offending people. He would also resign. In both of these cases, the stories were pulled so late in the process that the title didnt appear that month at all.
              </p>
              <p>
               When DC purchased Wildstorm, they also purchased Alan Moores ABC line, pulling the writer very reluctantly back into DCs orbit. He would leave DC for a second time after they censored his line twice. Once when removing a real vintage Marvel Douche ad from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, then again when a Cobweb story about L. Ron Hubbard was pulled for fear of Scientology.
              </p>
              <p>
               And in September of 2013, J.H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman would resign in protest from Batwoman after DC pulled the plug on the planned marriage between Batwoman and Maggie Sawyer. DC would insist that it had nothing to do with the controversial subject of gay marriage, but the creative team publicly ridiculed the notion.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the Batgirl case, theres no body involved who seems upset about the cover being pulled, so it seems rather silly to take offense on their behalf when the comic industry has a long history of offending their creative teams.
              </p>

               Good video, but I am curious about one point. You mentioned that the artist came out, saying the cover was changed because they decided in the end it wasnt appropriate, and so it wasnt DC bringing down pressure to change or censorship. However, whenever you talk about developers under EA, the assumption is that, even when they were saying the choices were theirs and no pressure was applied, it was EA forcing them to change and parade the party line. Im not saying there isnt a good reason as to why your attitudes are different, but I was wondering what your reasoning was to take one at face value and assume nefarious coercion with the other.

                 You make a good point. I try (keyword  TRY) to provide as nuanced an argument as possible in the time I allot myself, so hopefully my arguments are not coming across as completely black-and-white. The point is, its a complex issue that we cannot really scream censorship! at as if that clears it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With regards to developers, I think the fact that every game published by EA follows the same homogenized model gives us reasonable cause to suggest theres undue pressure, or at least stern suggestions being put forth  and its worth nothing that I try to never say the devs been outright forced to do anything  in the Unicronic Arts video, for example, I made a point to say that the developers may indeed be totally complicit in the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And thats where the point about us not having to *like* the decisions comes in. Whether or not EA forces or simply encourages all its games to adopt a similar grey goo method, we dont have to like it  and were free to criticize it  either way.

                   Fair points. Thanks for the reply. What you said got me realizing part of the problem with the overuse censorship arguments is that its so much easier to say they did the bad word rather then delve into more nuanced and subjective arguments. People want to be unequivocally right rather then take part in a discussion. Its a shame. I liked that cover, but admittedly I just know the old Batgirl stories, where the joker was a source of terror for her, so it worked. Its not like fear had been completely off the table for Batman either. True batman wouldnt be terrified of the joker because they have a different dynamic, but even the stoic batman has been shown to be terrified. Hell, thats the Scarecrows whole gimmick. If batman was never shown to be afraid, scarecrow would never have been a memorable villain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Joker is what the old Batgirl would see if gassed by Scarecrow, and with good reason. However, if they changed Batgirls and jokers relationship plot point with the reboot then I can agree that maybe its a bit over the top, especially for her own series. It would really depend on the story arc of the comic to justify that cover without the old background. Thats just my subjective appraisal though, which is admittedly less fun then saying Im right and theyre wrong, though hopefully more valuable.

                   At the risk of defending EA, isnt that one of those nebulous market things though?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   EA foots the bill for the game. In return, the game has to hit certain points and fit within whatever marketable vision EA wants.

                   As the internet libertarians are quick to remind us, the studio is free to not publish the game but they arent really free to complain after they took the money but realized they didnt want to do what they were paid to do.

               So is it editing or censorship if a creator feels pressed to make changes to something like a film based on the initial theater run?  The movie Legend was complete and showed to several test audiences in the US and Ripley Scott felt pressured to do a lot of cutting and make a lot of changes to the film that no one else working on the project felt was necessary.  He later regretted the changes made, particularly because most of the cut material was lost.  I dont think that actually falls into either category.  He wasnt told to change the film, in fact he was told NOT to change the film, but he felt pressured by the audience reactions to do so.  I feel like thats a murky middle ground we need a new word for.

                 It was editing, but clearly it falls under the allowance I made for editing that we dont have to like. Creators are not infallible, and can of course regret the decisions they made, especially if the reasons for the edits were dodgy to begin with. Lord knows there are decisions Ive made with the videos Ive cut together that Ive regretted in hindsight.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Listening to audiences is valuable, but theyre words should not be complete and total law. Ultimately, the creators will still be free to take feedback into consideration, and even if its the wrong call, it was still a call they made.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Theres definitely some grey areas though, youre not wrong.

               Im not sure youre in the right here on the comic cover Jim. If you posted a video on YouTube, and tens of thousands of people raged against it, demanding you take it down, change, to dance little monkey man!
               <br/>
               and then you do just that, no one would be saying Oh look at Jim! Such integrity! What an artist!
              </p>
              <p>
               Even if you give some bullshit reason about Oh, this video wasnt in keeping with what I do yadda yadda, no one is going to believe you did anything but bow down to censorship.
              </p>
              <p>
               Put it this way: if no one had made a fuss about the Batman cover, would the artist still have asked for it to be taken down? If not, then that was censorship pure and simple.

                 Had this decision come from the creative team of Batgirl, then I might just concede that youre right.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But what you have here are two editorial decisions at odds with one another as the writer of Batgirl was quite opposed to the cover on the grounds of tone. So youre left with the choice between the creative integrity of the regular creative team who is trying to build an audience for the book and the creative integrity of what is a month-long stunt of people completely divorced from the regular teams intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So how would you feel if you were putting out something and some folks who have absolutely nothing to do with it slapped a cover on it that was completely at odds with what you were trying to achieve? That you immediately objected to, but only after said people released the image to the entire world?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you really think creative integrity ends the second that idiot makes his plans known. That your intent and plans should mean absolutely nothing because its now about censorship.
                </p>
                <p>
                 DC, in its all-too-typical manner, cocked this up. Its pretty much what they do these days. They pushed through an editorial mandate without the slightest thought as to how it might affect another of their editorial mandates to create a more diverse line of comics to appeal the greater diversity they see at comic events. To just slap a cover intended to appeal to the traditional adult male fan by homaging a decades old grim-n-gritty comic on a book aimed at a younger, fun-loving audience. DC didnt think the decision through and it ended up happening in public instead of private, where I have no doubt everyone would have come to the exact same decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even Erik Larsen, who is extremely vocal in his opposition to Marvel canceling the Spider-Woman alternate cover says this is not censorship. I doubt youll find many comic pros who would call this censorship. The only people who are calling this censorship are the people who are attempting to be offended on behalf of people who are very clearly not offended. Save your outrage for all the times the creative teams are resigning in protest. Theres no shortage of those circumstances. Instead of screaming CENSORSHIP when everyone involved is saying no, its about creative integrity.

                 Thats an interesting claim. What if the artist had not perceived the cover in that way until it was pointed out to them?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Indeed, I quite liked the cover until the problems were mentioned and then I did realise that they could be seen as problematic. Not from an SJW perspective, not because of wimmins wights and all that but simply because it might be uncharacteristic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A lot of people have absolute crap to say about a lot of things, that doesnt mean that genuine concerns arent among the complaints.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Indeed, Jim HAS changed his videos. I presume youve seen his earliest outings at the Escapist? I did, I posted in a thread or two early on, the official video threadamybobthings, stating what I didnt like and I remember Jim changing how he did thingswas that censorship? Did I participate in censoring The Great and Almighty Jim Sterling? No, I made a point (I hope a compelling one) about his videos and he changed the way theyre written.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Despite the awful way I write comments like these I have genuinely spent years editing postgraduate essays of varying types for friends. Am I censoring them when I recommend changes in format to the text or when I reword paragraphs to avoid repetition? No, editing is incredibly useful, necessary even and other people can sometimes spot things that we simply miss.

                 Censorship doesnt mean changing something due to public response  Censorship requires some legislative body to be providing an *official* oversight and then adjusting the content to meet the rules that control content of that type.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I get that this feels a little esoteric and the word Censorship has been somewhat usurped by the easily-offended internet generation, so I am going to give you a bit of history and examples which hopefully put things in context.
                </p>
                <p>
                 1) Comics
                </p>
                <p>
                 Since there is a comic reference in this video, I will talk a little about censorship in comics. In the 40s comics were targeted by various factions as being a detrimental influence on American youth. The industry was not regulated  but the public was riled up through a number of agitators to make comic content an issue that led to the government turning their attention towards the industry and threatening regulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The response to this was the pathetic  the comic industry imposed a self-censorship in the form of the Comics Code Authority. The shear volume of restrictions and rules regarding the content allowed in a comic book is quite literally overwhelming. That any writer was able to create any good content is shocking in retrospect.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This self-censorship wasnt enough for organizations like the 1970s Concerned Mothers of America who sought to apply even more restrictions to comic books, and in some ways were successful in pushing some comic publishers to be even more cautious.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To give you some idea of what the comic industry was facing here are just a handful of restrictions they faced:
                </p>
                <p>
                 1) The word Horror or Terror shall not be used in the title of a comic book
                 <br/>
                 2) In every instance, good shall triumph over evil and all criminals will be punished for their misdeeds.
                 <br/>
                 3) The Police, judges and government officials shall never be presented in such a way as to create disrespect for the established authority
                 <br/>
                 4) Illicit sexual relationships are neither to be hinted at, nor portrayed. Rape scenes as well as sexual abnormalities are unacceptable. (remember, sexual abnormality was not a defined thing)
                 <br/>
                 5) Suggestive illustration or suggestive posture is unacceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even though this is self-imposed and not government-imposed censorship, THIS is censorship. This is what every creator fears
                </p>
                <p>
                 Similarly, ESRB for games and MPAA for movies, are self-censorship institutions  presumably to avoid official government legislation of their industries. While not as insidious as the comics code was, the commercial impact on a movie for being raised to R from PG13 often leads to studios requiring the movie director to make significant cuts, and perhaps altering the artistic intent to push the movie back to the desired rating.
                </p>
                <p>
                 2) The FCC
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Federal Communications Commission is pretty much the definition of censorship when it comes to broadcast television and radio.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Obscene, Indecent and profane broadcasts are, BY LAW, prohibited either entirely, or within what is commonly known as a watershed time period. You can certainly do a search and find out what that specifically means, but Obscene is outlawed entirely, indecent and profane content is generally after 10 PM.

               Yes he chose to ask the cover to be pulled voluntarily just like Visceral wanted microtransactions in Dead space 3 right  I believe that completely  /s
              </p>
              <p>
               As to the cover not fitting the tone of the comic well its not supposed to its a variant celebrating the Joker dont like the variant? then buy the regular cover.
              </p>

               The internet were every Ned Flanders wannabe can get everything they hate banned by easily finding other douchebags like themselves to do online campaigns.  After all nothing makes people happier than being offended and taking away from those who dare not to be offended.

                 Business goals vs. Creative Direction is another discussion for a different Jimquisition (one from the past, or assuredly one for the future).

               See Jim I think the main source of the outrage at the editing of Podquisition is the suggestion that you could be involved in anything that would be less than perfect the first time :O!

               Ooooh boy the Youtube comments are a big bag of fun on this one. Great ep though! Poor Gav.
              </p>
              <p>
               On that whole batgirl cover issue (
               <i>
                big
               </i>
               caveat before I start: I dont read the comics, so I dont know Batgirls character, but Im gonna assume shes generally portrayed as Batman-But-Female or fairly close to), I wonder if the intent was to be a shocking look, our undefeatable hero has been rendered weak and powerless by the villain! type of thing, like a cover depicting a defeated Batman or Superman cover would do. But because of cultural connotations with the whole damsel-in-distress thing, the viewing publics interpretation is going to be a bit skewed, making the art not quite hit the notes its aiming for, providing the desire to change it. That was kinda tricky to put into words, but I hope it makes sense!
              </p>
              <p>
               Personally, I really like the art; its powerful &amp; shows the Joker at his most menacing  when hes in control  but I can see why some wouldnt like it and want it changed, including the artist.

                 Okay, imagine that someone decided to use that as an alternate cover for the Batman TV Series DVD.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now, its not that big of a tonal disconnect, but it gives you an idea. The Killing Joke was a rather grim-n-gritty affair written during a time when comics were trying really hard to convince everyone they were all grown up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Batgirl, by comparison, is designed to appeal to a younger audience and features a selfie-taking Batgirl in a Cosplay friendly costume. Its fun and the kind of book that is trying very hard to not be like a book like The Killing Joke.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lots of people take the position that on another book, this cover would be fine. It just doesnt belong on the current Batgirl. And it really, really doesnt belong on it. The creative team of Batgirl is very insistent on that.
                </p>

                   But its a variant cover not the only cover for this issue and is celebrating the Joker and his past associations with various DC characters in this case the killing joke the most famous Joker and Batgirl story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It was only going to be available to those who specifically order it, it wasnt going to be the cover on the rack copys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So pulling it all together is still stupid.

                     From what I understand the Joker event is not a limited edition variant situation.As a 50/50 variant, its a rack copy. Literally half the issues would be selling the book as a grim-n-gritty book, something it is actively trying to assert itself as not being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And, again, the creative team of the book DOESNT WANT THIS COVER ON THEIR BOOK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Lets be brutally honest. The vast majority of people screaming the loudest about this arent exactly the sort of people who were ever going to buy this comics. Many of the critics have been quite critical of the creative team on the grounds of them being *gasp* SJWs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Why the hell should DC Comics listen to a noisy minority who is unlikely to buy the book no matter what they do? It makes far more sense to let the books new creative team define their own identity and find the audience theyre looking for. Not confuse the issue with a cover that all-too-accurately reflects the contents of most DC books, but not Batgirl.

                       Creative teams tend to get very unhappy when Editorial sticks their dick into their book willy-nilly. Theyre happy to pitch their ideas to an editor and content when editors do their job of helping make the work better; but absolutely no one likes having someone higher up come in and demand they do X, Y, and Z, regardless of what they have previously planned.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Yes, its the publishers right to do so. DC can declare that Batman must wearing a comically over-sized codpiece and the creative team has to do it but if DC is ordering them to put Batman in a comically over-sized codpiece, you have to wonder about the people making decisions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Just because you can force your creative teams to do something does not mean that you should force them to do it.

                 Batgirl, in a previous incarnation, was very famously (in perhaps one of the more critically acclaimed comic moments) shot by the joker, and the bullet shattered her spine, putting her in a wheelchair for the remainder of her existence. This didnt take Barbara Gordon out of the comic world, she later became Oracle and helped batman from a more supportive role using her computer skills to be an impressive source of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The cover is very reminiscent of the event in question  and thus, is a little out of place with the reimagining of Batgirl. But the Joker is a suitably crazy fellow  so you could sell the reaction batgirl is having without the history. However, the current batgirl is more likely to be looking for an escape rather than freaking out, which brings the concept of the cover under creative and critical review.

               Mmmm kinda I mostly agree but there is that annoying thing in the back of my head, pass the drunken muses that are out cold and ignoring me. That dark black thing in the far back that doubts humanity, basically I am waiting on when the SJW and co. bully anyone and everyone to do not do things they like to the point where bans and editing become functional and something that can be done I hope I am just another tin foil hat loony but this is humanity we are talking.
              </p>
              <p>
               PS:I hate creativity. It only works when it wants toolike the muses.

               PSS: That last bit was a bit disjointedreminds me of nearly everything bloody thing I do ;_;

               The Joker thing was removed because allegedly the artist received death threats.  Theres an article that claims so.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, the main argument from the SJW crowd when it came to the Batgirl was the removal of agency.  The issue there is that theres the matter that those who felt that the agency removal are also the same people who likely never read the comic series.
              </p>
              <p>
               Batgirl got crippled after being shot by the Joker, and got turned into fan favourite Oracle.  Yeah, that is a pretty bad thing that happened to her.
              </p>
              <p>
               Theres another character that got their agency removed.  Jason Todd, the second Robin.  He was bound, beaten for hours and then killed by the Joker for no real reason  He just wanted to do it, knowing that Batman couldnt do a thing to stop him.
              </p>
              <p>
               Worse, Todd got turned into a semi-villain called The Red Hood, which most people either didnt care for or dont really remember.  And how he returned was pretty screwed up, involving a Lazurus pit, if I remember correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
               So frankly, the only reason that the cover was pulled was because of the internet deciding that it was wrong.

                 DCs press release made mention of death threats, which many people assumed were directed at the cover artist. Cameron Stewart came out pretty quickly to state the death threats were actually made against the people who complained about the cover.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ive not heard any confirmation on the rumor about the cover artist getting death threats and Stewarts statement seems to suggest he never received any.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If that holds, that puts them one up on Hal Jordan fans, who sent death threats to Ron Marz after he wrote the Emerald Twilight story in Green Lantern a couple of decades ago.

                 No, not quite. The way I heard it was that he pulled it because the people OBJECTING were receiving threats.

                 Everything Ive seen so far indicates that the artist pulled it for his own personal reasons. Other than fan conspiracy theories I havent seen anything that indicates censorship.

                <p>
                 Nope, completely incorrect. The artist requested it be pulled because he and Batgirls writers agreed it didnt work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 People who objected to the cover got the death threats, because the kind of people who are obsessed with SJWs have no concept of reason or restraint.

               Is it me, or is SJW being used the same way today on the Internet the same way that Commie was used in 1950s America? A nebulous, vaguely defined boogeyman, no real threat that nonetheless gets treated as the root of all evil in society?

                 Its not just you. SJW has no meaning, except as a good way to tell whether or not the person youre speaking to is intellectually lazy and has no way to actually deal with real life.

                   As far as I know, SJW was supposed to be the liberal equivalent of a soccer mom, but then again were talking about the kind of people that say that videos give a cucky vibe so I dont expect any consistent definition from these kind of groups on the internet

                 Pretty much. They are the reason for everything bad that has ever happened and will no doubt do everything you fear might happen.

                 Amusing in comics, you can demonstrate how Marvel has increased their sales by embracing diversity, while DC has decreased theirs going after the same old aging fanboys to the point that DC has decided to go all-in on the Diversity Express because it seems pandering to an aging demographic isnt a particularly smart business strategy.

                 Want to derail the SJWs in comics. Its really easy. Put your money where your mouth is. Comics need butts in seats, not hot air on the Internet. The SJWs are the ones putting the butts in the seats. The antis are supplying nothing but hot air.

                 Is it me, or is SJW being used the same way today on the Internet the same way that Commie was used in 1950s America?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Commie is still used this way. No joke. As is socialist. The speaker doesnt know what the word means and doesnt care. The word slut can be applied to a virgin; in such a case, the word is not misused. The point was to hurt the target and the fact that the attack is nonsensical is of no moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Online, Ive asked whether Martin Luther King would be considered a SJW. My anecdotal interactions seem to indicate that the answer is: yes, if the accuser has the power to get away with the slur. If the accuser doesnt have that kind of pull, he makes up some bizarre distinction that allows the U.S. icon to escape the insult.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Incidentally, MLK was accused of being a communist throughout his career and even after his death.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If SJW seems to be a boogeyman applied to anyone who disagrees with a person, thats because thats exactly what it is. Not wanting to receive death threats makes you a SJW in the same way that wanting the right to vote makes you a commie.

                   Okay, interesting point. Ive seen people unironically claim that Martin Luther King would be dead-set against gay marriage, despite having fought and literally died for equal rights. Selective blindness is a hell of a drug.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I guess the point I was trying to bring across was that the spirit of the insult is the same, the name just gets changed to match the boogeyman of the day. So, thanks for backing up my point.

                     Im not saying he would, but its worth noting that many popular figures who fought for equal rights throughout history werent necessarily progressive by our standards. Many historical feminists, for example, were racist or homophobic,  and many advocates for equality of the races were homophobic or sexist. Recently, weve found that many homosexual individuals are sexist and biphobic (this is the main reason that the Gay Pride Parade has become something of an embarrassment in the LGBTQIA community). Back during the American Civil War, there was still loads of racism in the North and Canada; its just that they were marginally less racist than the South (and, more cynically, the Union army had a lot to gain by freeing slaves and recruiting them).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I dont know whether this applies to MLK, but fighting for equal rights your entire life doesnt necessarily make you tolerant towards every group. I think its important to make that distinction.

                <p>
                 The sad irony is that the people who use SJW as a way to discredit an opponent are committing the same logical fallacy as the people who the term originally described: that of making fascinating leaps of logic and tenuous-at-best connections to justify why their personal boogeyman (originally some form of sociology topic, now the fun police) is behind anything that they disagree with, sometimes with an this justifies my entitlement issues ulterior motive thrown into the mix.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For example, a woman couldnt possibly practice basic hygiene because she didnt want to stink.  No, she was obviously subliminally programmed by the male patriarchy to conform to an oppressive set of expectations!  Aroma privilege is not being met with disgust because of bathing!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Or from the other side, Lara Croft couldnt possibly have been re-proportioned for Rise of the Tomb Raider because A) the devs are dropping the original animated look for a more photo-realistic one and B) she only had those proportions in the first place due to artist error that the producer realized would visually convey This 250-triangle blob isnt a dudeno, it has to be the nefarious machinations of those evil fun police.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the end, zealots (on either side) are why the rest of us cant have nice things, like a thoughtful conversation on geek culture growing out of the Teenager wanting to be seen as an adult, but has no idea how to do so, and ends up showing their immaturity by turning their back on everything they used to like and over-indulging on whats off-limits for kids phase.

                 Yes, SJW is used exactly the same way as commie was back in the McCarthy era. To make the comparison even more apt, Gamergate has even released a list of supposed corrupt SJWs and SJW sympathizers to avoid (which has Jim Fucking Sterling Son featured on it, which Im sure he is quite proud of, I would be!). This kneejerk opposition to any form of inclusivity and diversity within gaming is some seriously depressing shit. All of the crying about SJWs and Feminazis can be summed up as WAAHHH, ME DONT WANT CHANGE! CHANGE BAD!. As if diversity of protagonists and new ways to tell stories will be the death knell of the medium and not a way to maintain its relevance to a changing demographic.

                   I *would* be proud if they could help themselves and resist obsessively following everyone on that boycott list.

                   I WISH theyd boycott me. If they stuck to their playground, and let the rest of us stick to ourselves, I think wed ALL be a lot happier.

                     Ive been wondering about this. When did boycott take on the meaning of go on everything this person does and shout about how wrong they are? Or in boycotting games, when did it turn from Im not going to buy this thing for personal reasons to Im going to tell everyone what a shitty game this is (and then likely buy it anyways?
                     <br/>
                     As a personal example, I chose not to buy Assassins Creed IV for a particular reason that is not pertinent to the discussion here. I have no problem with other people buying it, playing it, and enjoying it, nor do I go on every Assassins Creed IV topic and post THIS GAME IS THE WORST EVER BECAUSE X!

                     Yeah, I forgot it was meant to be a boycott list. They way they act, though it is more accurately their enemies list of those they must oppose and defeat. Sorry you and everyone on that list have to deal with this shite, Jim. God, I can imagine the YouTube comments for this are going to be a real cesspool of venom and stupidity.

                     Honestly, Im kind of glad they went to the trouble of turning so many people against them. Given how many people were fooled into believing they were the good guys and then went on to openly take their side (your associate TotalBiscuit among them, God rest what remained of his sanity), I kind of wish they had concocted an excuse to add even more people to the list. Hell, I can think of at least a few choice articles they could have used as evidence that Yahtzee is an SJW; maybe he wouldnt be in hot water with the real social justice crowd right now if hed been pressured into taking a side.

                     McCarthyism and white supremacy were and are real; the internal commie threat was not. SJW is a lie created by compulsive liars.

               Marvelous video, as per usual. However, I was mildly amused you chose to not use the simplest, perhaps most poignant, example of editing versus censorship as presented in these forums every day; to wit: excessive grammar mistakes and egregious misspellings. Of course, this applies to just about every website that allows for user comments to be added, so, I am not in any way targeting your site, Sir Jim (the Queen will come round on that title before her passing, Im sure).
               <br/>
               I understand that this is a very laid-back environment, no reason to go pissing people off by editing their posts, but I believe you to be a fairly well-read man. You are familiar with the use of  (sic)  as pertains to editing written materials presenting quotes from persons other than the non-news source to indicate that any and all errors (grammatical or spelling)  appearing in that particular quote, snippet, comment, or editorial are not the fault of the paper/magazine/website, but purely the ineptitude or (being generous) ignorance of the source of the inappropriateness.
               <br/>
               Well, I hope you dont mind me sharing this particular peccadillo of mine. I just think that the disintegration of the English language is something that has only been exacerbated to an exponential degree with all the social media outlets which provide no quality control and allow for just erbaut n-ee mispellings  to be put up with no CONCERN for how this might impact readers and their own followers.
              </p>
              <p>
               On a side note, I know Gavin has been trying to introduce you to some awesome metal  I hope at some point after he mentioned Meshuggah, that he also introduced you to the likes of Protest the Hero, a Canadian-based group of some of the most talented guys playing today in the extreme/technical realm. Also worth note are Job For A Cowboy, whose latest is perhaps their most technically brilliant and fantastic yet. And lastly, from your former home-isle of England would be Skeleton Witch.  These guys have four discs out, are absolutely astounding, brutal, and will surely surprise. Yes, I agree with Gavin: Meshuggah rocks. But these are a few bands that also deserve your attention. I hope you can find the time to give em a listen.
               <br/>
               I thank god for you and shall continue to patronize your site and hopefully get a darn job soon so I can Patreon-ize your site as well.
               <br/>
               Peace and best wishes to you and yours for continued health and prosperity.
               <br/>

               So would this endorse the creative validity of special Jimquisition: Special Edition re-releases with CGI Miniture Fantasy Willem DeFoe?  If so, when are they coming?

               Im working on a podcast myself, and my friend is doing the editing for it, its going slow. How do you do it at a workable rate, and how long does it usually take?
              </p>
              <p>
               On the topic of the video, I agree with what you say, but I feel like youre talking about three different things. Rereleasing something, saying youll do something and changing after fan outrage, and changing something in the future due to criticism, and editing sections of a work before anythings gone public, seem like different things to me.

               People got mad that the Podquisition is edited? I EXPECT most podcasts to be edited, especially when I dont hear all of the random coughs, throat clears, presumed fits of uncontrollable laughter that ruins the flow of the show (but can be hilarious to leave in anyway). Even if I did have a problem with you editing the content that you produce (you know, to ensure that everything is going out looking and sounding the way you want it to and that the audience gets the best you are capable of producingyeah, downright deplorable stuff) most of the talk about editing on the podcast has been in regard to cutting out background noise and minimizing echoes. Is it really worth fighting for the uncut version so it can be harder to listen to and all around less entertaining?

               People never cease to amaze me..

               Censorship isnt the issue at all. Integrity is. If you like something, even if its literally shit, and would love to tape yourself eating it, then by all means do it and Ill congratulate you. Youre doing something that makes you happy.
              </p>
              <p>
               If however you do stuff to make other people happy, especially if youre doing it for the money, then youre nothing but a whore, the bitch of society and popular opinion.
              </p>
              <p>
               You dont like something you did, change it if its possible, dont if its not and stand by it.
               <br/>
               Someone else doesnt like something you did, leave it as it is. Change it and youre a worthless piece of shit. Grow a spine and then well talk. Someone doesnt like  a scene depicting rape or even a game allowing you to rape people? Fuck him/her/them. Nothing can be more offensive than Justin Bieber and millions of morons would suck his dick 24/7 yet you dont see me with a pitchfork in front of his house. The only thing I care less about than him is the retard who cares about what shit I like.

               To me, censorship is when someone tells you that you cant say or create something regardless of what you think. If someone makes a suggestion and you think to yourself actually thats a fair point maybe i wont do that. Then that isnt censorship thats being considerate of other people and also being aware of your own creations.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think that may be the important distinction to be made here. Censorship says to me that the creator isnt being given a choice as to whether they cut or change their creation. Either by forced change by another party or by overwhelming threats of implied career suicide. A few people saying Hey we think it would be better this way isnt censorship, thats called criticism and can be taken on board or ignored at the creators discretion.

               PLACID: Forgive my posting this here; the comment section apparently doesnt allow for replies more than three deep, which might be for the best.
              </p>
              <p>
               Firstly, I wish to point out that I never said the retraction amounted to censorship; I said only that it was a stretch to say it was editing in the same sense that the term editing had been used in the past. Im uncomfortable with the possibility we selectively use and mis-use language depending on whether we condemn or condone the results rather than the reality of what were describing, and with good reason.
              </p>
              <p>
               Secondly, I have to admit the alternate cover supercedes the original- which by many accounts people who wanted would have to seek out- remains a somewhat odd claim, like suggesting that Scarlet radically changed the existence of Gone With the Wind or the Bakshi Lord of the Rings enormously changes the Peter Jackson version. I am not convinced that the alternate cover, even if it had made it to publication, met the standards of doing harm to the comic enclosed, let alone to versions of the comic that it didnt adorn. To supercede the original cover, by actual definition, it would have to not merely co-exist with it, but replace it or make it obsolete; I dont see that as having occurred.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I want to make it equally clear that I understand that you and others *do* feel the existence of the cover harms the comic, and my holding a different opinion doesnt mean that I dont think yours has worth. That it doesnt bother me doesnt mean its wrong that it bothers you. Im not especially disturbed by the withdrawal of the cover, particularly in light of the creators having issues with it; I just hope that it genuinely was a respectful and mutual agreement among the creative staff that led to that decision. I dont think it was censorship. I just dont think it was necessarily editing, either.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you for taking the time to clarify your stance.

                 N.B.: I havent ventured an opinion on the Batgirl covers theme. Its the creators who claim that the cover is bad. Im just going with their view on it, because, well, theyre the creators. If you disagree  well, youre disagreeing not with me, but with the creator of the original work as to the character of that work. . . which is fine, but actually kinda off-topic. The topic is whether or not the creator is editing the product, and since they believe the cover is not consonant with their creation, and, in fact, undermines their creation  again, this is them, not me  then nixing the cover would fall under the heading of editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 (And ordering the cover done without creator consultation and releasing it to the public would fall under the heading of D.C. FUBAR as usual.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 I dont care about the cover. I dont care about Batgirl. I could care. I could dig into Batgirl. But Im not gonna.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do care that the creators care, though.

               People seriously thought your podcast wasnt edited at all and was just a straight cut start to finish?! *shakes head*
              </p>
              <p>
               What if someone had a giant burp in the middle of their sentence? What if Gavin had a bad combination of takeout food and booze the night before thought he was farting and ended up shitting his pants in the middle of a podcast? Sheesh, people.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think you should take it as a compliment though that your editing was so good people thought your podcasts were one long cut.
              </p>
              <p>
               One last favour to ask can you remove first comments that add nothing whatsoever to anything?
              </p>
              <p>
               Keep up the good work!

                 I can see how some people might come to that conclusion given how often Laura K Buzz mentions that they will fix something in post and then does not actually fix that thing in post. It starts to feel like fixing it in post is a running joke because the IS no post.

               Surely you can understand why the guy changing an arguably sexist batgirl cover looks like external pressure as a knee jerk reaction. If the batgirl cover legitimately was changed because it didnt fit the tone of the story in the book, then thats fine I guess other than the fact that themed variant covers generally dont need to match anything. But you cant deny that to the casual observer, it looks like the result of activism more than creative waffling. Similarly, if the line cut from DMC Dantes Mangled Cadaver had been Nothing left but to buy it a frilly pink dress and some patent leather gogo boots nobody would have cried censorship even though that actually would have been an objectively better line anyway.
              </p>
              <p>
               External pressure from special interest groups may not be censorship but there does need to be a word for it and not a nice word. Just because the power theyre using isnt the law doesnt mean it isnt power, and making creators stop to think whether they really want to deal with an impending shitstorm for a line or image may not be as powerful a gag as jail time would be, but it does have a stifling and homogenizing effect.
              </p>
              <p>
               But then, I suppose the irony there is that if the lesson is that creators MUST stick to their guns only when the content on the chopping block is of a controversial nature, thats just as stifling as letting the Sharkeesians have their feeding frenzy. It still means creators have to think about more than simply what works for the story. It would be great if people would take the time to research what looks like censorship before flipping out but we all know thats not gonna happen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cant really win this one without fundamentally changing how human nature works. Good luck!

                 This may not be the best place to draw a line in the sand. Exterior pressure or no, it was an inappropriate cover for the type of story they were trying to tell. I agree that there needs to be some way to safeguard artists from angry fans, but in this case, people were sort of right to be upset about it.

                   it was a theme variant cover. Those dont have anything to do with the story inside. Or if they do, I need to go read Action Comics right freaking now because just look at this masterpiece.

                   But that doesnt really even matter, because when it comes to this sort of activism even if youre right, youre wrong. You are still stifling the creativity of an artist through the application of social and political pressure.

                   And people were wrong to do that to Bioware too. Complaining that the ending sucked was perfectly fine. Complaining that the ending was vague and didnt make much sense is perfectly fine. Straight up demanding that the ending be changed? now youve crossed a line and should be ignored. And as much as I really wanted an ending where Sheppard moves to Rannoch and has like 15 purple babies and runs a bar with Garrus, Im glad Bioware stuck to their guns for the most part.

                 Other songs with the curious DmC chords are;
                </p>
                <p>
                 Alice in Chains  down in a hole (chorus)
                 <br/>
                 Black Label Society  Dead meadow (verse)
                 <br/>
                 Red Hot Chilli Peppers  Saviour (erm.. chorus mostly)
                 <br/>
                 Mumford and sons  Little lion man
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now if you can find a connection between all of these and the DmC game, ill be happy to hear any conspiracy theories that are not illuminati related.

               A big part of the insistence that changing something due to public opinion or feedback is somehow censorship is that it completely undermines how a market economy is supposed to work.

               Company does something. Customers dont like it.
               <br/>
               Company should now NOT make any changes?

               Is this opposite land?

               Do you believe devs anymore? I feel like we have come to an unfortunate time wherein the publisher has weird ownership over the developers. Youve seen it before Devs and people involved saying thing they know cannot be true but still saying it because, i think, they were forced by the publisher. I dont know if this is the case in either of Jims circumstances but I personally have a hard time trusting people who are owned by businesses anymore. Thats why Im here him, and thank god for him

               Your last few videos kind of remind me of Atlus Etrian Odyssey Untold. The game its-self is an updated graphically enhanced version of the original game with the region, story, spells, interface, mapping, graphics, etc changed to fit the audience of Etrian Odyssey IV with a story added in to fit.
              </p>
              <p>
               It changes several characters, the reason for going into the games dungeon, and many conflicts and monsters are changed completely, added, or removed added in. The combat changes themselves make entire blocks of the game easier and some bosses unusually difficult, therefore making it seem more like a cousin of the original game even though 90% of the original content is there.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thankfully, the series isnt very popular, so the only complaints Ive ever seen have been about Untolds story mode having a slightly bigger dungeon than ita non-story mode and that farming magic skills isnt very fun if you want to desperately far, the best magic for farming purposes. All legitimate complaints given to the game as-is whilst ignoring the original version of it.
