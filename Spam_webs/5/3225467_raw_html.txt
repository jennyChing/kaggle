    In AD 383, almost half a century after Constantine the
Great, first emperor of the Christian world, was baptized on his death-bed,
a twenty-nine-year-old professor of Latin rhetoric whom future centuries
would know as Saint Augustine arrived in Rome from one of the empire's
outposts in North Africa. He rented a house, set up a school and attracted
a number of students who had heard about the qualities of this provincial
intellectual, but it wasn't long before it became clear to him that he
wasn't going to be able to earn his living as a teacher in the imperial
capital. Back home in Carthage his students had been rioting hooligans,
but at least they had paid for their lessons; in Rome his pupils listened
quietly to his disquisitions on Aristotle and Cicero until it came time
to settle the fee, and then transferred en masse to another teacher, leaving
Augustine empty-handed So when, a year later, the Prefect of Rome offered
him the opportunity of teaching literature and elocution in the city of
Milan, and included travelling expenses in the offer, Augustine accepted
gratefully.1

    Perhaps because he was a stranger to the city and wanted
intellectual company, or perhaps because his mother had asked him to do
so, in Milan Augustine paid a visit to the city's bishop, the celebrated
Ambrose, friend and adviser to Augustine's mother, Monica. Ambrose (who,
like Augustine, was later to be canonized) was a man in his late forties,
strict in his orthodox beliefs and unafraid of even the highest earthly
powers; a few years after Augustine's arrival in Milan, Ambrose forced
the emperor Theodosius I to show public repentance for ordering a massacre
of the rioters who had killed the Roman governor of Salonica.7 And when
the empress Justina requested that the bishop hand over a church in his
city so that she could worship according to the rites of Arianism, Ambrose
organized a sit-in, occupying the site night and day until she desisted.

    According to a fifth-century mosaic, Ambrose was a small,
cleverlooking man with big ears and a neat black beard that diminished
rather than filled out his angular face. He was an extremely popular speaker;
his symbol in later Christian iconography was the beehive, emblematic of
eloquence.3 Augustine, who considered Ambrose fortunate to be held in such
high regard by so many people, found himself unable to ask the old man
the questions about matters of the faith that were troubling him because,
when Ambrose was not eating a frugal meal or entertaining one of his many
admirers, he was alone in his cell, reading.

    Ambrose was an extraordinary reader. "When he read,"
said Augustine, "his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out
the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone
could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that
often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence,
for he never read aloud."4

    Eyes scanning the page, tongue held still: that is exactly
how I would describe a reader today, sitting with a book in a cafe across
from the Church of St. Ambrose in Milan, reading, perhaps, Saint Augustine's
Confessions. Like Ambrose, the reader has become deaf and blind to the
world, to the passing crowds, to the chalky flesh-coloured facades of the
buildings. Nobody seems to notice a concentrating reader: withdrawn, intent,
the reader becomes commonplace.

    To Augustine, however, such reading manners seemed aufficiently
strange for him to note them in his Confessions. The implication is that
this method of reading, this silent perusing of the page, was in his time
something out of the ordinary, and that normal reading was performed out
loud. Even though instances of silent reading can be traced to earlier
dates, not until the tenth century does this manner of reading become usual
in theWest.s

    Augustine's description of Ambrose's silent reading (including
the remark that he never read aloud) is the first definite instance recorded
in Western literature. Earlier examples are far more uncertain. In the
fifth century BC, two plays show characters reading on stage: in Euripides'
Hippolytus, Theseus reads in silence a letter held by his dead wife; in
Aristophanes' The Knights, Demosthenes looks at a writing-tablet sent by
an oracle and, without saying out loud what it contains, seems taken aback
by what he has read.6 According to Plutarch, Alexander the Great read a
letter from his mother in silence in the fourth century BC, to the bewilderment
of his soldiers.7 Claudius Ptolemy, in the second century AD, remarked
in On the Criterion (a book that Augustine may have known) that sometimes
people read silently when they are concentrating hard, because voicing
the words is a distraction to thought.8 And Julius Caesar, standing next
to his opponent Cato in the Senate in 63 BC, silently read a little billet-doux
sent to him by Cato's own sister.9 Almost four centuries later, Saint Cyril
of Jerusalem, in a catechetical lecture probably delivered at Lent of the
year 349, entreated the women in church to read, while waiting during the
ceremonies, "quietly, however, so that, while their lips speak, no
other ears may hear what they say"10 -a whispered reading, perhaps,
in which the lips fluttered with muffled sounds.

    If reading out loud was the norm from the beginnings of
the written word, what was it like to read in the great ancient libraries?The
Assyrian scholar consulting one of the thirty thousand tablets in the library
of King Ashurbanipal in the seventh century BC, the unfurlers of scrolls
at the libraries of Alexandria and Pergamum, Augustine himself looking
for a certain text in the libraries of Carthage and Rome, must have worked
in the midst of a rumbling din. However, even today not all libraries preserve
the proverbial silence. In the seventies, in Milan's beautiful Biblioteca
Ambrosiana, there was nothing like the stately silence I had noticed in
the British Library in London or the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The
readers at the Ambrosiana spoke to one another from desk to desk; from
time to time someone would call out a question or a name, a heavy tome
would slam shut, a cartful of books would rattle by. These days, neither
the British Library nor the Bibliotheque Nationale is utterly quiet; the
silent reading is punctuated by the clicking and tapping of portable word-
processors, as if flocks of woodpeckers lived inside the book-lined halls.
Was it different then, in the days of Athens or Pergamum, trying to concentrate
with dozens of readers laying out tablets or unfurling scrolls, mumbling
away to themselves an infinity of different stories? Perhaps they didn't
hear the din; perhaps they didn't know that it was possible to read in
any other way. In any case, we have no recorded instances of readers complaining
of the noise in Greek or Roman libraries-as Seneca, writing in the first
century, complained of having to study in his noisy private lodgings.11

    Augustine himself, in a key passage of the Confessions,
describes a moment in which the two readings-voiced and silent-take place
almost simultaneously. Anguished by indecision, angry at his past sins,
frightened that at last the time of his reckoning has come, Augustine walks
away from his friend Alypius, with whom he has been reading (out loud)
in Augustine's summer garden, and flings himself down under a fig-tree
to weep. Suddenly, from a nearby house, he hears the voice of a child-boy
or girl, he can't say-singing a song whose refrain is tolle, lege, "take
up and read".12 Believing that the voice is speaking to him, Augustine
runs back to where Alypius is still sitting and picks up the book he has
left unfinished, a volume of Paul's Epistles. Augustine says, "I took
hold of it and opened it, and in silence I read the first section on which
my eyes fell."The passage he reads in silence is from Romans 13-an
exhortation to "make not provision for the flesh" but to "put
ye on [i.e., 'like an armour'] the Lord Jesus Christ". Thunderstruck,
he comes to the end of the sentence. The "light of trust" floods
his heart and "the darkness of doubt" is dispelled.

    Alypius, startled, asks Augustine what has affected him
so. Augustine (who, in a gesture so familiar to us across those alien centuries,
has marked the place he was reading with a finger and closed the book)
shows his friend the text. "I pointed it out to him and he read [aloud,
presumably] beyond the passage which I had read. I had no idea what followed,
which was this: Him that is weak in the faith receive ye." This admonition,
Augustine tells us, is enough to give Alypius the longed-for spiritual
strength. There in that garden in Milan, one day in August of the year
386, Augustine and his friend read Paul's Epistles much as we would read
the book today: the one silently, for private learning; the other out loud,
to share with his companion the revelation of a text. Curiously, while
Ambrose's prolonged wordless perusal of a book had seemed to Augustine
unexplainable, he did not consider his own silent reading surprising, perhaps
because he had merely looked at a few essential words.

    Augustine, a professor of rhetoric who was well versed
in poetics and the rhythms of prose, a scholar who hated Greek but loved
Latin, was in the habit-common to most readers-of reading anything he found
written for sheer delight in the sounds.'3 Following the teachings of Aristotle,
he knew that letters, "invented so that we might be able to converse
even with the absent", were "signs of sounds" and these
in turn were "signs of things we think".14 The written text was
a conversation, put on paper so that the absent partner would be able to
pronounce the words intended for him. For Augustine the spoken word was
an intricate part of the text itself-bearing in mind Martial's warning,
uttered three centuries earlier:
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    The verse is mine; but friend, when you declaim it,
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    It seems like yours, so grievously you maim it.15

    Written words, from the days of the first Sumerian tablets,
were meant to be pronounced out loud, since the signs carried implicit,
as if it were their soul, a particular sound. The classic phrase scripta
manes, verba volat-which has come to mean, in our time, "what is written
remains, what is spoken vanishes into air"-used to express the exact
opposite; it was coined in praise of the word said out loud, which has
wings and can fly, as compared to the silent word on the page, which is
motionless, dead. Faced with a written text, the reader had a duty to lend
voice to the silent letters, the scripta, and to allow them to become,
in the delicate biblical distinction, verba, spoken words-spirit. The primordial
languages of the Bible-Aramaic and Hebrew-do not differentiate between
the act of reading and the act of speaking; they name both with the same
word. 16

    In sacred texts, where every letter and the number of
letters and their order were dictated by the godhead, full comprehension
required not only the eyes but also the rest of the body: swaying to the
cadence of the sentences and lifting to one's lips the holy words, so that
nothing of the divine could be lost in the reading. My grandmother read
the Old Testament in this manner, mouthing the words and moving her body
back and forth to the rhythm of her prayer. I can see her in her dim apartment
in the Barrio del Once, the Jewish neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, intoning
the ancient words from her bible, the only book in her house, whose black
covers had come to resemble the texture of her own pale skin grown soft
with age. Among Muslims too the entire body partakes of the holy reading.
In Islam, the question of whether a sacred text is to be heard or read
is of essential importance. The ninthcentury scholar Ahmad ibn Muhammad
ibn Hanbal phrased it in this manner: since the original Koran-the Mother
of the Book, the Word of God as revealed by Allah to Muhammad-is uncreated
and eternal, did it become present only in its utterance in prayer, or
did it multiply its being on the perused page for the eye to read, copied
out in different hands throughout the human ages? We do not know whether
he received an answer, because in 833 his question earned him the condemnation
of the mihnah, or Islamic inquisition, instituted by the Abassid caliphs.17
Three centuries later, the legal scholar and theologian Abu Hamid Muhammad
al-Ghazali established a series of rules for studying the Koran in which
reading and hearing the text read became part of the same holy act. Rule
number five established that the reader must follow the text slowly and
distinctly in order to reflect on what he was reading. Rule number six
was "for weeping.... If you do not weep naturally, then force yourself
to weep", since grief should be implicit in the apprehension of the
sacred words. Rule number nine demanded that the Koran be read "loud
enough for the reader to hear it himself, because reading means distinguishing
between sounds", thereby driving away distractions from the outside
world.18

    The American psychologist Julian Jaynes, in a controversial
study on the origin of consciousness, argued that the bicameral mind-in
which one of the hemispheres becomes specialized in silent reading- is
a late development in humankind's evolution, and that the process by which
this function develops is still changing. He suggested that the earliest
instances of reading might have been an aural rather than a visual perception.
"Reading in the third millennium BC may therefore have been a matter
of hearing the cuneiform, that is, hallucinating the speech from looking
at its picture-symbols, rather than visual reading of syllables in our
sense."19

   <font size="+1">
    This "aural hallucination" may have been true
also in the days of Augustine, when the words on the page did not just
"become" sounds as soon as the eye perceived them; they were
sounds. The child who sang the revelatory song in the garden next door
to Augustine's, just like Augustine before him, had no doubt learned that
ideas, descriptions, true and fabricated stories, anything the mind could
process, possessed a physical reality in sounds, and it was only logical
that these sounds, represented on the tablet or scroll or manuscript page,
be uttered by the tongue when recognized by the eye. Reading was a form
of thinking and of speaking. Cicero, offering consolation to the deaf in
one of his moral essays, wrote, "If they happen to enjoy recitations,
they should first remember that before poems were invented, many wise men
lived happily; and second, that much greater pleasure can be had in reading
these poems than in hearing them."20 But this is only a booby-prize
tendered by a philosopher who can himself delight in the sound of the written
word. For Augustine, as for Cicero, reading was an oral skill: oratory
in the case of Cicero, preaching in the case of Augustine.

    Until well into the Middle Ages, writers assumed that
their readers would hear rather than simply see the text, much as they
themselves spoke their words out loud as they composed them. Since comparatively
few people could read, public readings were common, and medieval texts
repeatedly call upon the audience to "lend ears" to a tale. It
may be that an ancestral echo of those reading practices persists in some
of our idioms, as when we say, "I've heard from So-and-so" (meaning
"I've received a letter"), or "So-and-so says" (meaning
"So-and-so wrote"), or "This text doesn't sound right"
(meaning "It isn't well written").

  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Because books were mainly read out loud, the letters that
composed them did not need to be separated into phonetic unities, but were
strung together in continuous sentences. The direction in which the eyes
were supposed to follow these reels of letters varied from place to place
and from age to age; the way we read a text today in the Western world-from
left to right and from top to bottom-is by no means universal. Some scripts
were read from right to left (Hebrew and Arabic), others in columns, from
top to bottom (Chinese and Japanese); a few were read in pairs of vertical
columns (Mayan); some had alternate lines read in opposite directions,
back and forth-a method called boustrophedon, "as an ox turns to plough",
in ancient Greek.Yet others meandered across the page like a game of Snakes
and Ladders, the direction being signalled by lines or dots (Aztec).21

   <font size="+1">
    The ancient writing on scrolls-which neither separated
words nor made a distinction between lower-case and upper-case letters,
nor used punctuation-served the purposes of someone accustomed to reading
aloud, someone who would allow the ear to disentangle what to the eye seemed
a continuous string of signs. So important was this continuity that the
Athenians supposedly raised a statue to a certain Phillatius, who had invented
a glue for fastening together leaves of parchment or papyrus.22 Yet even
the continuous scroll, while making the reader's task easier, would not
have helped a great deal in disentangling the clusters of sense. Punctuation,
traditionally ascribed to Aristophanes of Byzantium (circa 200 BC) and
developed by other scholars of the Library of Alexandria, was at best erratic.
Augustine, like Cicero before him, would have had to practice a text before
reading it out loud, since sight-reading was in his day an unusual skill
and often led to errors of interpretation. The fourth- century grammarian
Servius criticized his colleague Donat for reading, in Virgil's Aeneid,
the words collectam ex llio pubem ("a people gathered from troy")
instead of collectam exilio pubem ("a people gathered for exile").23
Such mistakes were common when reading a continuous text.

    Paul's Epistles as read by Augustine were not a scroll
but a codex, a bound papyrus manuscript in continuous writing, in the new
uncial or semi-uncial hand which had appeared in Roman documents in the
last years of the third century. The codex was a pagan invention; according
to Suetonius,24 Julius Caesar was the first to fold a roll into pages,
for dispatches to his troops. The early Christians adopted the codex because
they found it highly practical for carrying around, hidden away in their
clothes, texts that were forbidden by the Roman authorities. The pages
could be numbered, which allowed the reader easier access to the sections,
and separate texts, such as Paul's Epistles, could easily be bound in one
convenient package.25

  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    The separation of letters into words and sentences developed
very gradually. Most early scripts - Egyptian hieroglyphs, Sumerian cuneiform,
Sanskrit-had no use for such divisions. The ancient scribes were so familiar
with the conventions of their craft that they apparently needed hardly
any visual aids, and the early Christian monks often knew by heart the
texts they were transcribing.26 In order to help those whose reading skills
were poor, the monks in the scriptorium made use of a writing method known
as per cola et commata, in which the text was divided into lines of sense-a
primitive form of punctuation that helped the unsteady reader lower or
raise the voice at the end of a block of thought. (This format also helped
a scholar seeking a certain passage to find it with greater ease.)27 It
was Saint Jerome who, at the end of the fourth century, having discovered
this method in copies of Demosthenes and Cicero, first described it in
his introduction to his translation of the Book of Ezekiel, explaining
that "what is written per cola et commata conveys more obvious sense
to the readers".28

   <font size="+1">

  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Punctuation remained unreliable, but these early devices
no doubt assisted the progress of silent reading. By the end of the sixth
century, Saint Isaac of Syria was able to describe the benefits of the
method: "I practice silence, that the verses of my readings and prayers
should fill me with delight. And when the pleasure of understanding them
silences my tongue, then, as in a dream, I enter a state when my senses
and thoughts are concentrated. Then, when with prolonging of this silence
the turmoil of memories is stilled in my heart, ceaseless waves of joy
are sent me by inner thoughts, beyond expectation suddenly arising to delight
my heart."29 And in the mid-seventh century, the theologian Isidore
of Seville was aufficiently familiar with silent reading to be able to
praise it as a method for "reading without effort, reflecting on that
which has been read, rendering their escape from memory less easy".30
Like Augustine before him, Isidore believed that reading made possible
a conversation across time and space, but with one important distinction.
"Letters have the power to convey to us silently the sayings of those
who are absent,"31 he wrote in his Etymologies. Isidore's letters
did not require sounds.

  </p>
  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    The avatars of punctuation continued. After the seventh
century, a combination of points and dashes indicated a full stop, a raised
or high point was equivalent to our comma, and a semicolon was used as
we use it today.32 By the ninth century, silent reading was probably common
enough in the scriptorium for scribes to start separating each word from
its encroaching neighbours to simplify the perusal of a text -but perhaps
also for aesthetic reasons. At about the same time, the Irish scribes,
celebrated throughout the Christian world for their skill, began isolating
not only parts of speech but also the grammatical constituents within a
sentence, and introduced many of the punctuation marks we use today.33
By the tenth century, to further ease the silent reader's task, the first
lines of the principal sections of a text (the books of the Bible, for
example) were ordinarily written in red ink, as well as the rubrics (from
the Latin for "red"), explanations independent of the text proper.
The ancient practice of beginning a new paragraph with a dividing stroke
(paragraphos in Greek) or wedge (diple) continued; later the first letter
of the new paragraph was written in a slightly larger or upper- case character.

   <font size="+1">
    The first regulations requiring scribes to be silent in
the monastic scriptoriums date from the ninth century.34 Until then, they
had worked either by dictation or by reading to themselves out loud the
text they were copying. Sometimes the author himself or a "publisher"
dictated the book. An anonymous scribe, concluding his copying sometime
in the eighth century, writes this: "No one can know what efforts
are demanded. Three fingers write, two eyes see. One tongue speaks, the
entire body labours."35 One tongue speaks as the copyist works, enunciating
the words he is transcribing.

  <p>
   <font size="+1">
    Once silent reading became the norm in the scriptorium,
communication among the scribes was done by signs: if a scribe required
a new book to copy, he would pretend to turn over imaginary pages; if he
specifically needed a psalter, he'd place his hands on his head in the
shape of a crown (in reference to King David); a lectionary was indicated
by wiping away imaginary wax from candles; a missal, by the sign of the
cross; a pagan work, by scratching his body like a dog.36

    Reading out loud with someone else in the room implied
shared reading, deliberate or not. Ambrose's reading had been a solitary
act. "Perhaps he was afraid," Augustine mused, "that if
he read out loud, a difficult passage by the author he was reading would
raise a question in the mind of an attentive listener, and he would then
have to explain what it meant or even argue about some of the more abstruse
points."37 But with silent reading the reader was at last able to
establish an unrestricted relationship with the book and the words. The
words no longer needed to occupy the time required to pronounce them. They
could exist in interior space, rushing on or barely begun, fully deciphered
or only half-said, while the reader's thoughts inspected them at leisure,
drawing new notions from them, allowing comparisons from memory or from
other books left open for simultaneous perusal. The reader had time to
consider and reconsider the precious words whose sounds- he now knew-could
echo just as well within as without. And the text itself, protected from
outsiders by its covers, became the reader's own possession, the reader's
intimate knowledge, whether in the busy scriptorium, the market-place or
the home.

    Some dogmatists became wary of the new trend; in their
minds, silent reading allowed for day-dreaming, for the danger of accidie-
the sin of idleness, "the destruction that wasteth at noonday".35
But silent reading brought with it another danger the Christian fathers
had not foreseen. A book that can be read privately, reflected upon as
the eye unravels the sense of the words, is no longer subject to immediate
clarification or guidance, condemnation or censorship by a listener. Silent
reading allows unwitnessed communication between the book and the reader,
and the singular a refreshing of the mind", in Augustine's happy phrase.39

    Until silent reading became the norm in the Christian
world, heresies had been restricted to individuals or small numbers of
dissenting congregations. The early Christians were preoccupied both with
condemning the unbelievers (the pagans, the Jews, the Manicheans and, after
the seventh century, the Muslims) and with establishing a common dogma.
Arguments digressing from orthodox belief were either vehemently rejected
or cautiously incorporated by Church authorities, but because these heresies
had no large followings, they were treated with considerable leniency.
The catalogue of these heretical voices includes several remarkable imaginations:
in the second century the Montanists claimed (already) to be returning
to the practices and beliefs of the primitive Church, and to have witnessed
the second coming of Christ in the form of a woman; in the second half
of that century the Monarchianists concluded from the definition of the
Trinity that it was God the Father who had suffered on the Cross; the Pelagians,
contemporaries of Saint Augustine and Saint Ambrose, rejected the notion
of original sin; the Apollinarians declared, in the last years of the fourth
century, that the Word, and not a human soul, was united with Christ's
flesh in the Incarnation; in the fourth century the Arians objected to
the word homoousios (of same substance) to describe the stuff of which
the Son was made and (to quote a contemporary jeu de moss) "convulsed
the Church by a diphthong"; in the fifth century the Nestorians opposed
the ancient Apollinarians and insisted that Christ was also a man; the
Eutychians, contemporaries of the Nestorians, denied that Christ had suffered
as all humans suffer.40

    Even though the Church instituted the death penalty for
heresy as early as 382, the first case of burning a heretic at the stake
did not occur until 1022, in Orleans. On that occasion the Church condemned
a group of canons and lay nobles who, believing that true instruction could
only come directly from the light of the Holy Spirit, rejected the Scriptures
as "the fabrications which men have written on the skins of animals".4l
Such independent readers were obviously dangerous. The interpretation of
heresy as a civil offence punishable by death was not given legal basis
until 1231, when the emperor Frederick I decreed it as such in the Constitutions
of Melfi, but by the twelfth century the Church was already enthusiastically
condemning large and aggressive heretical movements that argued not for
ascetic withdrawal from the world which the earlier dissenters had proposed)
but for a challenge to corrupt authority and the abusive clergy, and for
an individual reckoning with the Divinity. The movements spread through
tortuous byways, and crystallized in the sixteenth century.

    On October 31, 1517, a monk who, through his private study
of the Scriptures, had come to believe that the divine grace of God superseded
the merits of acquired faith, nailed to the door of All Saints Church in
Wittenberg ninety-five theses against the practice of indulgences -the
selling of remission from temporal punishment for condemned sins-and other
ecclesiastical abuses. With this act Martin Luther became an outlaw in
the eyes of the empire and an apostate in those of the Pope. In 1529 the
Holy Roman emperor Charles V rescinded the rights granted to Luther's followers,
and fourteen free cities of Germany, together with six Lutheran princes,
caused a protest to be read against the imperial decision. "In matters
which concern God's honour and salvation and the eternal life of our souls,
everyone must stand and give account before God for himself," argued
the protesters or, as they were later to be known, Protestants.Ten years
earlier, the Roman theologian Silvester Prierias had stated that the book
upon which the Church was founded needed to remain a mystery, interpreted
only through the authority and power of the pope.42 The heretics, on the
other hand, maintained that people had the right to read the word of God
for themselves, without witness or intermediary.43

    Centuries later, beyond a sea that for Augustine would
have been at the limits of the earth, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who owed his
faith to those ancient protesters, took advantage of the art that had so
surprised the saint. In church, during the lengthy and often tedious sermons
which he attended out of a sense of social responsibility, he silently
read Pascal's Pensees. And at night, in his cold room in Concord, "covered
with blankets to the chin", he read to himself the Dialogues of Plato.
("He associated Plato," noted a historian, "ever after,
with the smell of wool.")44 Even though he thought there were too
many books to be read, and thought readers should share their findings
by reporting to one another the gist of their studies, Emerson believed
that reading a book was a private and solitary business. "All these
books," he wrote, drawing up a list of "sacred" texts that
included the Upanishads and the Pensees, "are the majestic expressions
of the universal conscience, and are more to our daily purpose than this
year's almanac or this day's newspaper. But they are for the closet, and
are to be read on the bended knee. Their communications are not to be given
or taken with the lips and the end of the tongue, but out of the glow of
the cheek, and with the throbbing heart."45 In silence.

    Observing the reading of Saint Ambrose that afternoon
in 384, Augustine could hardly have known what was before him. He thought
he was seeing a reader trying to avoid intrusive visitors, sparing his
voice for teaching. In fact he was seeing a multitude, a host of silent
readers who over the next many centuries would include Luther, would include
Calvin, would include Emerson, would include us, reading him today.
