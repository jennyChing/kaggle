      American
    nature writer, Joseph Wood Krutch, has insisted that caring about nature is mystical in
    origin; and Arne Naess, an influential Norwegian philosopher, who champions nature for
    nature's sake, once spoke of a compelling emotional experience that seems to be the
    driving force for passionate environmentalism. It is the experience many people have in
    nature of being connected to something greater than their ego -- it is a sort of oceanic
    feeling. This mystical experience is the burning bush, which gives champions of wilderness
    and animal rights a sense of mission, rightness and purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      In
      <em>
       The Gentle Art of Tramping
      </em>
      , Stephen Graham said, "As you sit on the
    hillside, or lie prone under the trees of the forest, or sprawl wet-legged by a mountain
    stream, the great door, that does not look like a door, opens." Annie Dillard,
    writing about her solitary nature experiences in the southern Appalachians, said this:
    "Experiencing the present purely is being empty and hollow; you catch grace as a man
    fills his cup under a waterfall". She wrote of a nature experience where she felt
    like an immense bell that was being struck. In a letter to his brother, Theo, Van Gogh
    once confessed that he had "a terrible need of--shall I say the word--religion. Then
    I go out and paint the stars." Christianity's greatest mystic, Meister Eckhart, spoke
    of the sublime moment when "all blades of grass, wood, and stone, all things are
    One." The mythologist, Joseph Campbell, once said God is the experience of looking at
    a tree and saying, "Ah!"
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <em>
       Centuries of Meditations
      </em>
      of Thomas Traherne, written in the seventeenth
    century, but not published until the early twen tieth century, rhapsodized about the
    divine presence in the beauties of the earth. "You never enjoy the world
    aright," he wrote, "'till the sea itself floweth in your veins, 'till you are
    clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars."
     </p>
     <p>
      Charlene Spretnak wrote the following:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font color="#800000">
         There are sacred moments in life when we experience in rational
        and very direct ways that separation, the boundary between ourselves and other people and
        between ourselves and Nature, is illusion. Oneness is reality. We can experience that
        stasis is illusory and that reality is continual flux and change on very subtle and also
        on gross levels of perception . .
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      She says a prime way for experiencing these sublime moments is to go into wilderness,
    approaching it with silence and alertness, while carefully observing the flow of inner and
    outer events.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anyone who does this, she says, will eventually come to perceive "a deep, deep
    silence and a oneness that is almost palpable." Spretnak says at such moments the
    distinction between inner and outer mind dissipates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The mystical feeling in nature is most often described as a feeling of oneness.
    Rousseau wrote this about his experiences on Peter Island on the Lake of Bienne:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font color="#800000">
         As evening approached, I came down from the heights of the
        island, and I liked then to go and sit on the shingle in some secluded spot by the lake;
        there the noise of the waves and the movement of the water, taking hold of my senses and
        driving all other agitation from my soul, would plunge me into delicious reverie in which
        night often stole upon me unawares.
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The words of Byron express the oneness with nature, which has, since Rousseau, been the
    obsession of nature mystics: "I live not in myself, but I became a portion of all
    around me, and to me high mountains are a feeling . . ." Byron also wrote: "Are
    not the mountains, waves and skies a part of me and of my soul, as I of them?"
     </p>
     <p>
      Nature mysticism often sounds like pantheism. Consider these fragments from a poem by
    the Asian poet, Rumi:
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       I am the dust in the sunlight, I am the ball of the sun . . .
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       I am the mist of morning, the breath of evening . . . .
       <br/>
       I am the spark in the stone, the gleam of gold in the
       <br/>
       metal . . . .
       <br/>
       The rose and the nightingale drunk with its fragrance.
       <br/>
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       I am the chain of being, the circle of the spheres,
       <br/>
       The scale of creation, the rise and the fall.
       <br/>
       I am what is and is not . . .
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       I am the soul in all.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      In her book called
      <em>
       Ecstasy
      </em>
      , Laski reports research findings indicating that
    the most frequent trigger for mystical experi ences is nature, with nature art being the
    second most frequent trigger. Another national survey found that almost half of all the
    people who have had mystical experiences consider the beauties of nature to be the primary
    inspiration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rudolf Otto defined nature mysticism as "the sense of being immersed in the
    oneness of nature, so that man feels all the individuality, all the peculiarities of
    natural things in himself. He dances with the motes of dust and radiates with the sun; he
    rises with the dawn, surges with the wave, is fragrant with the rose, rapt with the
    nightingale: he knows and is all being, all strength, all joy, all desire, all pain in all
    things inseparably." Aldous Huxley called mystical oneness with nature "the
    perennial philosophy".
     </p>
     <p>
      Stace suggested that mystical experiences can be classified as either extraverted or
    introverted. In introverted mysticism, the environment is lost. This occurs to those who,
    like St. Augustine, reject the sensuousness of natural phenomena and enter into a world of
    pure spirit. Augustine believed we should aban don the world and its beauty. The beauties
    of nature, he believed, are vain and transitory. To love nature is to become a slave to
    nature and to turn away from spiritual abstractions which are embedded in the eternal.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the second type, extraverted mysticism, which is a nature experience. In
    extraverted mysticism, the surroundings are "lit up" and the world appears to us
    as it did in all its numinous glory to Adam on the day of creation. A good example of
    extraverted mysticism is in the verse of Kabir, a fifteenth century poet from India, which
    Robert Bly has translated and paraphrased:
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       Friend, hope for the Guest while you are alive . . . .
       <br/>
       If you do not break your ropes while you're alive,
       <br/>
       do you think
       <br/>
       Ghosts will do it after?
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      Aldous Huxley aided by mescaline said, "I was seeing what Adam had seen on the
    morning of creation -- the miracle, moment by moment of naked existence." Gazing at
    flowers he reported experiencing "a transcendence that was yet eternal life, a per
    petual perishing that was at the same time pure Being, a bundle of minute, unique
    particulars in which, by some unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox was to be seen the
    divine source of all existence." Meister Eckhart spoke of this Adamic seeing when he
    wrote, "If you want to discover nature's nakedness, you must destroy its
    symbols."
     </p>
     <p>
      Some Freudian psychologists have equateded the "oneness" feeling in nature
    and religion with regressive fantasies of being one with one's Mother. We were one with
    her in the womb, and as infants we experienced oneness at her breast. Jung, in
      <em>
       Symbols
    of Transformation
      </em>
      , carefully described how the imagery of nature mysticism tends to
    use maternal symbols.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nature mysticism can be -- but is not necessarily -- experienced as a sense of being in
    the presence of the divine. Seneca wrote: "When you enter a grove peopled with
    ancient trees, higher than the ordinary, and shutting out the sky with their thickly
    inter-twined branches, do not the stately shadows of the wood, the stillness of the place,
    and the awful gloom of this doomed cavern then strike you with the presence of a
    deity?" There is something about woodlands, mountains and deserts that evokes awe and
    religious sentiments. Large stands of ancient trees give us a sense of the vast, the holy,
    the unspeakable. We sense being a part of something far larger than our individual egos
    and feel connected to eternity. In the Celtic iron age the Druids worshiped in sacred
    oak-groves. Novelist, John Fowles once said all sacred places derive their aura from
    forest settings.
     </p>
     <p>
      English writer and nature lover W. H. Hudson wrote in
      <em>
       The Purple Land
      </em>
      :
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       For here the religion that languishes in crowded cities or steals
    shame-faced to hide itself in dim churches, flourishes greatly, filling the soul with a
    solemn joy. Face to face with Nature on the vast hills at eventide, who does not feel
    himself near to the Unseen?
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      According to historian, Arnold Toynbee, the relationship between religion and nature is
    an irreducible fact.

      MYSTICISM IN WESTERN RELIGIOUS TRADITION
     </p>
     <p>
      In his
      <em>
       Confessions
      </em>
      , St. Augustine told of his attempts to seek God in the
    world of Nature, but argues that it was a mistake or it leads one to concentrate on the
    wrong things: "Not us, not us," he insisted, "but Him who made us."
    Augustine's words did not stop other Christian mystic from attempting to seek God through
    nature. Meister Eckhart spoke of the experience when "all blades of grass, wood, and
    stone, all things are One." [repeat] Jacob Boehme wrote, "In this light, my
    spirit saw through all things and into all creatures, and I recognized God in grass and
    plants." Gregory of Nyssa wrote, "Traveling through the creation, the virtuous
    man is led to the apprehension of the Master of the Creation." And Suso wrote,
    "O tender God, if Thou art so living in Thy creatures, how fair and lovely must Thou
    be in Thyself."
      <a href="st-francis.htm">
       Francis of Asissi
      </a>
      considered all created
    things--birds, beasts, flowers, sun, moon, even death--to be children of God and his
    brothers and sisters in Christ. John Smith wrote, "There is a twofold meaning in
    every creature, a literal and a mystical, and the one is but the ground of the
    other."

      mysticism is also prevalent in the literature of the East. A
    Zen Buddhist monk asks, for example, "How may I enter in the Way?" His master
    points to a mountain steam and says, "Do you hear the murmur of the stream? There you
    may enter." The
      <u>
       Zenrinkushu
      </u>
      says the lines of the hills are the Pure Body of
    Buddha. There is an ancient Zen saying that the mountains, the rivers, the earth,
    everything that happens, is -- without exception -- your own mind. Dogon, a Zen masater
    who lived from 1200 to 1253 a.d.spoke of mountains and rivers as being an immediate and
    direct revelation of truth; he said they are perfect exactly as they are: "Mountains
    and rivers at this very moment are the actualization of the world of the ancient Buddhas.
    Each, abiding in its phenomenal expression, realizes completeness."

      The Mysticism of John Muir
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      In describing his first explorations of the Sierras, John Muir wrote, "Oh, these
    vast, calm measureless mountain days, inciting at once to work and rest! Days in whose
    light every thing seems equally divine, opening a thousand windows to show us God."
      <sup>
       21
      </sup>
      It is probably safe to say that no American ever experienced wilderness as religious
    ecstasy more than Muir. He called the Sierras the Range of Light and -- as Light in the
    sky -- they evoked in him immense religious longings. Before the magnificence of nature,
    he found himself dumb with admiration, prostrate and humble before the power of the God
    who created it all. Muir declared himself willing to endure self-denial if that was the
    price of learning to read from the divine manuscript which was the rocks and the trees.
    All wilderness, he wrote, seems full of tricks and hidden plans to drive us up into God's
    light. Of the Sierras he declared:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font color="#800000">
         These blessed mountains are so compactly filled with God's
        beauty, no petty personal hope or experience has room to be . . . . the whole body seems
        to feel beauty when exposed to it as it feels the campfire or sunshine, entering not by
        the eyes alone, but equally through all one's flesh like radiant heat, making a passionate
        ecstatic pleasure-glow not explainable. One's body then seems homogeneous throughout,
        sound as a crystal.
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      While sauntering through the mountains, he said he knew complete freedom. He had
    experiences that seemed timeles and spaceless. Occasionally, he felt his body had no
    weight. "Life seems neither long nor short," he once wrote, "and we take no
    more heed to save time or make haste than do the trees and stars." He experienced
    what he believed was God's time, an immense perspective which made the quick
    transformations of the cloud-mountains and the slow transformations of the granite
    mountain roughly equivalent. He entered the eternal now and experienced days that seemed
    to have neither end nor beginning. Muir claimed that in the Sierras he found a practical
    sort of immortality, and he at times experienced himself as dissolved into the landscape.
    The mountains, he said, are fountains, places where the transcendent spews out of the
    earth.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Range of Light, Muir experienced the interrelated of all things, the union of
    rocks and clouds, the humanness of the landscape, the wilderness in the human soul. He
    declared a kinship with the wild Nature he loved, a oneness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Muir repeatedly compared Yosemite Valley and the mountain peaks around it to a church
    or a cathedral. After many awe- struck moments gazing at Cathedral Rock through openings
    in the trees, he decided to climb to the top. Writing of this experience, he said it was
    the first time since he had come to California that he had been to church. Atop this giant
    monolith, he had the sensation of doors opening, revealing the transcendent realm. On this
    mountain alter he found cassiope -- a species of flower for which he had been searching.
    The bells of the flowers, he wrote, were ringing with the sweetest church music he had
    ever heard.
     </p>
     <p>
      It puzzled Muir that many of his fellow humans did not appreciate God's grandeur as it
    manifested itself in the wilderness. His companion on his first summer in the Sierra, a
    shepherd named Billy -- who, in Muir's descriptions, seems something of a Sancho Panza
    figure -- called Yosemite Valley "a lot of rocks -- a hole in the ground." Muir
    witnessed other tourists who seemed unimpresssed by the majesty of Yosemite: he saw
    fishermen baiting their hooks "in the holiest of temples ignoring God himself as he
    preaches sublime water and stone sermons."
     </p>
     <p>
      All Muir's books seem to say the same thing over and over: "Look! Nature is
    overflowing with the grandeur of God!" To Muir religious feelings were as natural as
    breathing. Nature herself seemed constantly engaged in worship. Even trees bowing in the
    wind were celebrants of a primordial religion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <font color="#800000">
       A few minutes ago every tree was excited, bowing to the roaring
    storm, waving, swirling, tossing their branches in glorious enthusiasm like worship. But
    though to the outer ear these trees are now silent, their songs never cease. Every hidden
    cell is throbbing with music and life, every fiber thrilling like harp strings, while
    incense is ever flowing from the balsam bells and leaves. No wonder the hills and
    groves were God's first temples, and the more they are cut down and hewn into cathedrals
    and churches, the farther off and dimmer seems the Lord himself.
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      Though Muir didn't worship the trees, he did seem to worship with the trees and through
    the trees. In his idiosyncratic and exuberant way he celebrated the mysteries. Just who
    the God was he celebrated is unclear. Much of the language sounds Christian and orthodox,
    but there is a Dionysian or pagan element that spills through it all. His strivings and
    his imagery are always upward towards what could, I think, be characterized as a Pure Land
    -- an ideal world that lies in the clouds. "The region above our camp," he
    writes in
      <em>
       My First Summer in the Sierra
      </em>
      , "is still wild, and higher lies the
    snow about as trackless as the sky." As a hummingbird finds itself drawn to the
    flowers, so did John Muir find himself drawn to this Pure Land in the sky. Of one of his
    first ascents into the Sierras, he wrote, "Now away we go toward the topmost
    mountains. Many still, small voices, as well as the noon thunder, are calling, 'Come
    higher.'"
     </p>
     <p>
      On coming to a high mountain meadow, he once remarked that not a single leaf or petal
    seems to be misplaced. This passage brings to mind the Zen aphorism that no snowflake ever
    falls in the wrong place. As far as Muir was concerned the deer walking through this
    meadow or the bears rolling around in it in no way spoiled it -- their trampling was to
    him a gentle cultivation. On more than one occasion, Muir wrote of being struck by how
    clean nature is. All plants are clean; all animals are clean. Of all the living things on
    the planet, mankind alone seems dirty. Even the occasional Indians he passed in the
    wilderness struck him as being dirty. Muir considered the high mountains to be a mirror
    that reflects the Creator. When he was in the wilderness he sensed the entire world
    glowing with God's radiance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Muir said the wildflowers he found at the top of one Sierra peak were "a cloud of
    witness to Nature's love in what we in our timid ignorance and unbelief call howling
    desert." Though the surface of the ground seemed, at first glance, to be dull and
    foreboding, a close inspection showed that it shined and sparkled with crystals: mica,
    hornblende, feldspars, quartz, tourmaline. This gave the mountaintop a radiance, which in
    some places was dazzling. To him every crystal and every flower was "a window opening
    into heaven, a mirror reflecting the Creator."
     </p>
     <p>
      To Muir all human beings have spiritual strivings, and the wilderness is a natural
    place to consummate the longings of the soul. In the Sierras, Muir attained a wider
    existence:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font color="#800000">
         We are now in the mountains and they arein us, kindling
        enthusiasm, making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our
        flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly
        an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks, in the
        waves of the sun, -- a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but
        immortal. Just now I can hardly conceive of any bodily condition dependent on food or
        breath any more than the ground or the sky. How glorious a conversion, so complete and
        wholesome it is.
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Muir called the mountains love-monuments. He elected to follow God in the way that came
    natural -- by drifting across the mountains and down into the canyons like the shadow of a
    cloud, like a faithful servant to the divine winds.
