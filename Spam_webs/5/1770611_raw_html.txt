        The problem with deep dish pizza (which Uno's knows a thing or two about, since they invented it back in 1943) is not just the extra empty calories and carbs from the crust, it's that the thick, doughy base provides the structural integrity to house extra heaps of cheese, sauce, and greasy toppings. The result is an individual pizza with more calories than you should eat in a day and more sodium than you would find in 27 small bags of Lays Potato Chips. Oh, did we mention it has nearly 3 days' worth of saturated fat, too?

        Wow. Its hard to imagine how a few fish tacos could contain more calories than four Big Macs, but if anyone can cram excess into a plate of Mexican food, its On the Border. The problem starts with the thick casing of beer batter on the fish, compounded by a hefty, cream-based sauce. In the case of Baja, nearly all of those calories come from lean protein and healthy fatboth from the fish and the generous wedges of avocado tucked into the tortillas.

        The two dishes couldnt be more similar in name and appearance, so how does Macaroni Grills end up with nearly four times the calories and more than five times the fat? Without access to the restaurants recipes, its tough to discern every drastic measure Mac Grill is taking to torture this poor sole, but in the end they produce one of the worst fish dishes weve ever seenstricken with nearly 3 full days worth of saturated fat. Like most restaurant blunders, a massive portion size and an abundance of cheap oil are most likely to blame here.

        You know a beer is in trouble when it needs to invoke the image of an oversize mythical beast just to describe itself. Perhaps a better name would have been Jabba the Hut Ale. Beer gets most of its calories from the booze itself, and with nearly 10 percent alcohol in each bottle, this brew is likely to create a beer belly nearly as quickly as it creates a buzz.

        How does Cos's coffee creation reach such abysmal heights? By dropping a giant Oreo cookie into the blender with a flood of chocolate syrup and then sticking another Oreo on top. The only thing stronger than the massive caffeine jolt will be the sugar crash to follow. "Blended coffee drinks" is a troubled genre in need of a name change; we think "caffeinated milk shakes" is a more apt description.

Nuke the squash for 10 minutes or until it's soft to the touch. Let it cool, then scrape out the "spaghetti" strands and top with pasta sauce and cheese. Youll eliminate 30 g carbohydrates per cup. The taste? "Great. Spaghetti squash has exactly the same consistency as real pasta."

        "If you take off your jacket, you'll still look put together," Jennings says. Opt for a tailored vest when you want to forgo a blazer, or try a fitted, solid-color T-shirt under a cardigan. When it comes to choosing your denim, stick to a dark wash with a straight, medium-to-slim fit. It's universally flattering and not overly casual, says stylist Marcy Carmack, the creator of

        "Some men look like they put on a suit and tie to go to work, and then just took off the suit pants and replaced them with a pair of jeans," says Eric Jennings, fashion director for menswear at Saks Fifth Avenue. So no French-cuff shirts or silk ties, please. But dont go too far in the opposite direction and sport jeans that are too loose or too baggy. Baggy may be comfortable, but it's also sloppy, while tight jeans scream high school. If you wear jeans to work, they should match your maturity, and fit as well as your trousers do.

        Wear a casual overcoat after 5 p.m. and all weekend long. "Or, more simply, whenever you're in casual clothes," says Brian Boy. Nothing screams fashion neophyte louder than a guy in a suit and a waist-length down coat. That said, it's possible to stylishly break this rule, provided your outerwear is longer than your suit coat. In fact, they do it on the runway all the time. You might try pairing a long parka with your suit and tie, for example. Just don't make a habit of it, or it'll seem clueless instead of daring.

Anyone pushing should be at the corner of the car, not directly behind it, to stay out of the way if it bucks, says Chuck Roberts, a spokesman for the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence.

        Don't bother carrying kitty litter in your trunk. Scattering it in front of the tires is useless: It'll sink into the snow. Also, don't use plywood under the tires; it can become a projectile that can hurt the pusher, the car, or another car, says Amy Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association. And don't gun the engine. "The more your wheels spin, the faster the snow will melt and the more stuck you'll be," says Roberts.

        Don't suggest a quiet night together. You can have a quiet night together anytime; she'll just feel like she's missing out. The evening should involve dressing up and dancing.

        Slow lifting builds huge muscles.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        University of Alabama researchers recently studied two groups of lifters doing a 29-minute workout. One group performed exercises using a 5-second up phase and a 10-second down phase, the other a more traditional approach of 1 second up and 1 second down. The faster group burned 71 percent more calories and lifted 250 percent more weight than the superslow lifters.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The real expert says: "The best increases in strength are achieved by doing the up phase as rapidly as possible," says Gary Hunter, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., the lead study author. "Lower the weight more slowly and under control." There's greater potential for growth during the lowering phase, and when you lower with control, there's less chance of injury.

        Stretching during a warmup has little effect on injury prevention.

        Stretching prevents injuries.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed more than 350 studies and articles examining the relationship between stretching and injuries and concluded that stretching during a warmup has little effect on injury prevention.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Stretching increases flexibility, but most injuries occur within the normal range of motion," says Julie Gilchrist, M.D., one of the study's researchers. "Stretching and warming up have just gone together for decades. It's simply what's done, and it hasn't been approached through rigorous science."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The real expert says: Warming up is what prevents injury, by slowly increasing your bloodflow and giving your muscles a chance to prepare for the upcoming activity. To this end, Dr. Gilchrist suggests a thorough warmup, as well as conditioning for your particular sport.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course, flexibility is a good thing. If you need to increase yours so it's in the normal range (touching your toes without bending your knees, for instance), do your stretching when your muscles are already warm.
        <br/>

        People with normal blood pressure do not need to restrict sodium intake.

        Salt causes high blood pressure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Large-scale scientific reviews have determined there's no reason for people with normal blood pressure to restrict their sodium intake. Now, if you already have high blood pressure, you may be "salt sensitive." As a result, reducing the amount of salt you eat could be helpful.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, it's been known for the past 20 years that people with high blood pressure who don't want to lower their salt intake can simply consume more potassium-containing foods. Why? Because it's really the balance of the two minerals that matters. In fact, Dutch researchers determined that a low potassium intake has the same impact on your blood pressure as high salt consumption does. And it turns out, the average guy consumes 3,100 milligrams (mg) of potassium a day1,600 mg less than recommended.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The bottom line: Strive for a potassium-rich diet, which you can achieve by eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and legumes. For instance, spinach, broccoli, bananas, white potatoes, and most types of beans each contain more than 400 mg potassium per serving.

        The Smith Machine
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Smith machinewhich looks like a squat rack with a built-in bar that runs on guidesgives you all the benefits of squats, but none of the risk that comes from holding a heavy barbell across your back. Thats because the bar can easily be secured at any point during the movement.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The truth: Because the bar runs on guides, you can only move straight up and down as you squatinstead of down and back, as you would in a free-weight squat. The result: An unnatural movement that puts extra stress on your knees and lower back. Need another reason to skip the Smith? Canadian researchers found that traditional squats produced almost 50 percent more muscle activity in the quadriceps than squats done on a Smith machine.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The alternative: If youre not comfortable with barbell squats, simply do the exercise while holding dumbbells at arms length next to your sides. You wont need a spotter, and your body will be free to move through the natural motion of the squat.

        Swiss Ball
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Don't abandon your trusty bench for exercises like the chest press and shoulder press if your goal is strength and size. "The reason people are using the ball and getting gains is because they're weak as kittens to begin with," says Craig Ballantyne, C.S.C.S. You have to reduce the weight in order to press on a Swiss ball, and this means you get less out of the exercise, he says.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The real expert says: A Swiss ball is great for variety, but center your chest and shoulder routines on exercises that are performed on a stable surface, Ballantyne says. Then use the ball to work your abs.

        Advair
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Advair contains the long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) salmeterol. A 2006 analysis of 19 trials, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that regular use of LABAs can increase the severity of an asthma attack.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Because salmeterol is more widely prescribed than other LABAs, the danger is greaterthe researchers estimate that salmeterol may contribute to as many as 5,000 asthma-related deaths in the United States each year. In 2006, similarly disturbing findings from an earlier salmeterol study prompted the FDA to tag Advair with a "black box" warningthe agency's highest caution level.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        No matter what you may have heard, a LABA, such as the one in Advair, is not the only option, says Philip Rodgers, Pharm.D., a clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina school of pharmacy. For instance, if you have mild asthma, an inhaled corticosteroid such as Flovent is often all you need.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Still wheezing? "Patients can also consider an inhaled corticosteroid paired with a leukotriene modifier," says Dr. Rodgers. This combo won't create dangerous inflammation, and according to a Scottish review, it's as effective as a corticosteroid-and-LABA combo.

        Prilosec and Nexium
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Heartburn can be uncomfortable, but heart attacks can be fatal, which is why the FDA has investigated a suspected link between cardiac trouble and the acid-reflux remedies Prilosec and Nexium. In December 2007, the agency concluded that there was no "likely" connection. Translation: The scientific jury is still out. In the meantime, there are other reasons to be concerned. Because Prilosec and Nexium are proton-pump inhibitors, they are both incredibly effective at stopping acid production in the stomachperhaps too effective.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A lack of acid may raise your risk of pneumonia, because the same stuff that makes your chest feel as if it's burning also kills incoming bacteria and viruses. You may also have an elevated risk of bone lossin the less acidic environment, certain forms of calcium may not be absorbed effectively during digestion. "The risk of a fracture has been estimated to be over 40 percent higher in patients who use these drugs long-term, and the risk clearly increases with duration of therapy," says Dr. Rodgers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When you feel the fire, first try to extinguish it with Zantac 150 or Pepcid AC. Both of these OTC products work by blocking histamine from stimulating the stomach cells that produce acid. Just know that neither drug is a long-term fix.

        . That's because when you're overweight, excess belly fat puts pressure on and changes the angle of your esophagus, pulling open the valve that's supposed to prevent stomach-acid leaks. This in turn makes it easier for that burning sensation to travel up into your chest.

        A moderately hard, steady pace
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can achieve more progress in a mere 15 minutes of interval training (done three times a week) than that guy grinding away on the treadmill for an hour. An intelligent man draws maximum benefit from a minimum time investment, and smarts are sexy. So are abs, a benefit of this training style. Researchers at Australia's University of New South Wales found that intervals burn three times as much fat as running twice as long at a moderately hard, steady pace.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But interval training's benefits don't end with heart health, fat incineration, or the preservation of that most precious of commodities, your time. Most sports worth playing involve stopping and starting, not running at one pace, so you'll rule on the court or field. What's more, your muscles will learn to contract more forcefully. Ultimately you'll live longer, too, because intervals elevate the good cholesterol that makes your arteries whooshing streams and not plaque-strewn rapids.
